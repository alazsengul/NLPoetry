# NLPoetry
📝 Web app experiment... can you tell which poem was computer-generated?

For our group project in Brian Greene's Origins and Meaning class at Columbia University, we decided to make this website. NLPoetry is a website that continuously displays two poem excerpts — one of the poems was written by a popular poet, and the other is generated in real-time by our code. Users have to select the poem that they think is real.

The name “NLPoetry” comes from the abbreviation for natural language processing (NLP), which is the study of computer science’s intersection with linguistics and language.
