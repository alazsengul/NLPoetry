954,24,"dissolved now, smoke of an old war,"
955,24,
956,24,2
957,24,nightly the battle-snouts start up
958,24,"in the ear of the veteran, and again"
959,24,"i enter the soft pelt of the mole,"
960,24,"light's death to them, they shrivel in it,"
961,24,"they move through their mute rooms while i sleep,"
962,24,"palming the earth aside, grubbers"
963,24,"after the fat children of root and rock,"
964,24,"by day, only the topsoil heaves,"
965,24,"down there one is alone,"
966,24,
967,24,"outsize hands prepare a path,"
968,24,"they go before, opening the veins,"
969,24,delving for the appendages
970,24,"of beetles, sweetbreads, shards -- to be eaten"
971,24,"over and over, and still the heaven"
972,24,of final surfeit is just as far
973,24,"from the door as ever, what happens between us"
974,24,"happens in darkness, vanishes"
975,24,"easy and often as each breath,"
976,25,i am sending back the key
977,25,that let me into bluebeard's study;
978,25,because he would make love to me
979,25,i am sending back the key;
980,25,in his eye's darkroom i can see
981,25,"my x-rayed heart, dissected body ,"
982,25,i am sending back the key
983,25,"that let me into bluebeard's study,"
984,26,"will they occur,"
985,26,these people with torso of steel
986,26,winged elbows and eyeholes
987,26,
988,26,awaiting masses
989,26,"of cloud to give them expression,"
990,26,these super-people! -
991,26,and my baby a nail
992,26,"driven, driven in,"
993,26,he shrieks in his grease
994,26,
995,26,"bones nosing for distance,"
996,26,"and i, nearly extinct,"
997,26,his three teeth cutting
998,26,
999,26,themselves on my thumb -
1000,26,"and the star,"
1001,26,"the old story,"
1002,26,
1003,26,"in the lane i meet sheep and wagons,"
1004,26,"red earth, motherly blood,"
1005,26,o you who eat
1006,26,
1007,26,"people like light rays, leave"
1008,26,this one
1009,26,"mirror safe, unredeemed"
1010,26,
1011,26,"by the dove's annihilation,"
1012,26,the glory
1013,26,"the power, the glory,"
1014,27,"mayday, two came to field in such wise ,"
1015,27,"`a daisied mead', each said to each,"
1016,27,"so were they one; so sought they couch,"
1017,27,"across barbed stile, through flocked brown cows,"
1018,27,
1019,27,"`no pitchforked farmer, please,' she said;"
1020,27,"`may cockcrow guard us safe,' said he;"
1021,27,"by blackthorn thicket, flower spray"
1022,27,"they pitched their coats, come to green bed,"
1023,27,
1024,27,"below, a fen where water stood;"
1025,27,"aslant, their hill of stinging nettle;"
1026,27,"then, honor-bound, mute grazing cattle;"
1027,27,"above, leaf-wraithed white air, white cloud,"
1028,27,
1029,27,all afternoon these lovers lay
1030,27,"until the sun turned pale from warm,"
1031,27,"until sweet wind changed tune, blew harm ,"
1032,27,"cruel nettles stung her angles raw,"
1033,27,
1034,27,"rueful, most vexed, that tender skin"
1035,27,"should accept so fell a wound,"
1036,27,he stamped and cracked stalks to the ground
1037,27,"which had caused his dear girl pain,"
1038,27,
1039,27,now he goes from his rightful road
1040,27,"and, under honor, will depart;"
1041,27,"while she stands burning, venom-girt,"
1042,27,"in wait for sharper smart to fade,"
1043,28,i made a fire; being tired
1044,28,of the white fists of old
1045,28,letters and their death rattle
1046,28,when i came too close to the wastebasket
1047,28,what did they know that i didn't?
1048,28,"grain by grain, they unrolled"
1049,28,sands where a dream of clear water
1050,28,"grinned like a getaway car,"
1051,28,i am not subtle
1052,28,"love, love, and well, i was tired"
1053,28,of cardboard cartons the color of cement or a dog pack
1054,28,holding in it's hate
1055,28,"dully, under a pack of men in red jackets,"
1056,28,"and the eyes and times of the postmarks,"
1057,28,
1058,28,"this fire may lick and fawn, but it is merciless,"
1059,28,a glass case
1060,28,my fingers would enter although
1061,28,"they melt and sag, they are told"
1062,28,"do not touch,"
1063,28,"and here is an end to the writing,"
1064,28,"the spry hooks that bend and cringe and the smiles, the smiles"
1065,28,"and at least it will be a good place now, the attic,"
1066,28,"at least i won't be strung just under the surface,"
1067,28,dumb fish
1068,28,"with one tin eye,"
1069,28,"watching for glints,"
1070,28,riding my arctic
1071,28,"between this wish and that wish,"
1072,28,
1073,28,"so, i poke at the carbon birds in my housedress,"
1074,28,"they are more beautiful than my bodiless owl,"
1075,28,they console me--
1076,28,"rising and flying, but blinded,"
1077,28,"they would flutter off, black and glittering, they would be coal angels"
1078,28,"only they have nothing to say but anybody,"
1079,28,"i have seen to that,"
1080,28,with the butt of a rake
1081,28,"i flake up papers that breathe like people,"
1082,28,i fan them out
1083,28,between the yellow lettuces and the german cabbage
1084,28,involved in it's weird blue dreams
1085,28,"involved in a foetus,"
1086,28,and a name with black edges
1087,28,
1088,28,"wilts at my foot,"
1089,28,sinuous orchis
1090,28,in a nest of root-hairs and boredom--
1091,28,"pale eyes, patent-leather gutturals!"
1092,28,"warm rain greases my hair, extinguishes nothing,"
1093,28,"my veins glow like trees,"
1094,28,"the dogs are tearing a fox, this is what it is like"
1095,28,a read burst and a cry
1096,28,that splits from it's ripped bag and does not stop
1097,28,with that dead eye
1098,28,"and the stuffed expression, but goes on"
1099,28,"dyeing the air,"
1100,28,"telling the particles of the clouds, the leaves, the water"
1101,28,"what immortality is, that it is immortal,"
1102,29,"this is winter, this is night, small love --"
1103,29,"a sort of black horsehair,"
1104,29,"a rough, dumb country stuff"
1105,29,steeled with the sheen
1106,29,"of what green stars can make it to our gate,"
1107,29,"i hold you on my arm,"
1108,29,"it is very late,"
1109,29,"the dull bells tongue the hour,"
1110,29,"the mirror floats us at one candle power,"
1111,29,
1112,29,"this is the fluid in which we meet each other,"
1113,29,this haloey radiance that seems to breathe
1114,29,and lets our shadows wither
1115,29,only to blow
1116,29,"them huge again, violent giants on the wall,"
1117,29,"one match scratch makes you real,"
1118,29,
1119,29,at first the candle will not bloom at all --
1120,29,it snuffs its bud
1121,29,"to almost nothing, to a dull blue dud,"
1122,29,
1123,29,"i hold my breath until you creak to life,"
1124,29,"balled hedgehog,"
1125,29,"small and cross, the yellow knife"
1126,29,"grows tall, you clutch your bars,"
1127,29,"my singing makes you roar,"
1128,29,i rock you like a boat
1129,29,"across the indian carpet, the cold floor,"
1130,29,while the brass man
1131,29,"kneels, back bent, as best he can"
1132,29,
1133,29,hefting his white pillar with the light
1134,29,"that keeps the sky at bay,"
1135,29,"the sack of black! it is everywhere, tight, tight!"
1136,29,"he is yours, the little brassy atlas --"
1137,29,"poor heirloom, all you have,"
1138,29,"at his heels a pile of five brass cannonballs,"
1139,29,"no child, no wife,"
1140,29,five balls! five bright brass balls!
1141,29,"to juggle with, my love, when the sky falls,"
1142,30,"they are the last romantics, these candles,"
1143,30,"upside-down hearts of light tipping wax fingers,"
1144,30,"and the fingers, taken in by their own haloes,"
1145,30,"grown milky, almost clear, like the bodies of saints,"
1146,30,"it is touching, the way they'll ignore"
1147,30,
1148,30,a whole family of prominent objects
1149,30,simply to plumb the deeps of an eye
1150,30,"in its hollow of shadows, its fringe of reeds,"
1151,30,"and the owner past thirty, no beauty at all,"
1152,30,"daylight would be more judicious,"
1153,30,
1154,30,"giving everybody a fair hearing,"
1155,30,"they should have gone out with the balloon flights and the stereopticon,"
1156,30,"this is no time for the private point of view,"
1157,30,"when i light them, my nostrils prickle,"
1158,30,"their pale, tentative yellows"
1159,30,
1160,30,"drag up false, edwardian sentiments,"
1161,30,"and i remember my maternal grandmother from vienna,"
1162,30,"as a schoolgirl she gave roses to franz josef,"
1163,30,"the burghers sweated and wept, the children wore white,"
1164,30,"and my grandfather moped in the tyrol,"
1165,30,
1166,30,"imagining himself a headwaiter in america,"
1167,30,floating in a high-church hush
1168,30,"among ice buckets, frosty napkins,"
1169,30,"these little globes of light are sweet as pears,"
1170,30,"kindly with invalids and mawkish women,"
1171,30,
1172,30,"they mollify the bald moon,"
1173,30,"nun-souled, they burn heavenward and never marry,"
1174,30,"the eyes of the child i nurse are scarcely open,"
1175,30,in twenty years i shall be retrograde
1176,30,"as these drafty ephemerids,"
1177,30,
1178,30,"i watch their spilt tears cloud and dull to pearls,"
1179,30,how shall i tell anything at all
1180,30,to this infant still in a birth-drowse?
1181,30,"tonight, like a shawl, the mild light enfolds her,"
1182,30,"the shadows stoop over the guests at a christening,"
1183,31,"on storm-struck deck, wind sirens caterwaul;"
1184,31,"with each tilt, shock and shudder, our blunt ship"
1185,31,"cleaves forward into fury; dark as anger,"
1186,31,"waves wallop, assaulting the stubborn hull,"
1187,31,"flayed by spray, we take the challenge up,"
1188,31,"grip the rail, squint ahead, and wonder how much longer"
1189,31,
1190,31,"such force can last; but beyond, the neutral view"
1191,31,"shows, rank on rank, the hungry seas advancing,"
1192,31,"below, rocked havoc-sick, voyagers lie"
1193,31,retching in bright orange basins; a refugee
1194,31,"sprawls, hunched in black, among baggage, wincing"
1195,31,"under the strict mask of his agony,"
1196,31,
1197,31,far from the sweet stench of that perilous air
1198,31,"in which our comrades are betrayed, we freeze"
1199,31,and marvel at the smashing nonchalance
1200,31,"of nature , what better way to test taut fiber"
1201,31,"than against this onslaught, these casual blasts of ice"
1202,31,that wrestle with us like angels; the mere chance
1203,31,
1204,31,of making harbor through this racketing flux
1205,31,"taunts us to valor, blue sailors sang that our journey"
1206,31,"would be full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched"
1207,31,"with radiance, peacock-colored; instead, bleak rocks"
1208,31,"jutted early to mark our going, while sky"
1209,31,curded over with clouds and chalk cliffs blanched
1210,31,
1211,31,"in sullen light of the inauspicious day,"
1212,31,"now, free, by hazard's quirk, from the common ill"
1213,31,"knocking our brothers down, we strike a stance"
1214,31,"most mock-heroic, to cloak our waking awe"
1215,31,"at this rare rumpus which no man can control ,"
1216,31,meek and proud both fall; stark violence
1217,31,
1218,31,"lays all walls waste; private estates are torn,"
1219,31,"ransacked in the public eye, we forsake"
1220,31,"our lone luck now, compelled by bond, by blood,"
1221,31,to keep some unsaid pact; perhaps concern
1222,31,"is helpless here, quite extra, yet we must make"
1223,31,"the gesture, bend and hold the prone man's head,"
1224,31,
1225,31,"and so we sail toward cities, streets and homes"
1226,31,"of other men, where statues celebrate"
1227,31,"brave acts played out in peace, in war; all dangers"
1228,31,"end , green shores appear; we assume our names,"
1229,31,"our luggage, as docks halt our brief epic; no debt"
1230,31,"survives arrival; we walk the plank with strangers,"
1231,32,"your clear eye is the one absolutely beautiful thing,"
1232,32,"i want to fill it with color and ducks,"
1233,32,the zoo of the new
1234,32,whose name you meditate --
1235,32,"april snowdrop, indian pipe,"
1236,32,little
1237,32,
1238,32,"stalk without wrinkle,"
1239,32,pool in which images
1240,32,should be grand and classical
1241,32,
1242,32,not this troublous
1243,32,"wringing of hands, this dark"
1244,32,"ceiling without a star,"
1245,33,"in sunless air, under pines"
1246,33,"green to the point of blackness, some"
1247,33,"founding father set these lobed, warped stones"
1248,33,to loom in the leaf-filtered gloom
1249,33,black as the charred knuckle-bones
1250,33,
1251,33,of a giant or extinct
1252,33,"animal, come from another"
1253,33,"age, another planet surely, flanked"
1254,33,by the orange and fuchsia bonfire
1255,33,"of azaleas, sacrosanct"
1256,33,
1257,33,these stones guard a dark repose
1258,33,and keep their shapes intact while sun
1259,33,alters shadows of rose and iris ---
1260,33,"long, short, long --- in the lit garden"
1261,33,and kindles a day's-end blaze
1262,33,
1263,33,colored to dull the pigment
1264,33,"of azaleas, yet burnt out"
1265,33,"quick as they, to follow the light's tint"
1266,33,and intensity by midnight
1267,33,by noon and throughout the brunt
1268,33,
1269,33,of various weathers is
1270,33,"to know the still heart of the stones,"
1271,33,stones that take the whole summer to lose
1272,33,their dream of the winter's cold; stones
1273,33,warming at core only as
1274,33,
1275,33,"frost forms, no man's crowbar could"
1276,33,"uproot them, their beards are ever-"
1277,33,"green, nor do they, once in a hundred"
1278,33,"years, go down to drink the river,"
1279,33,"no thirst disturbs a stone's bed,"
1280,34,the womb
1281,34,"rattles its pod, the moon"
1282,34,"discharges itself from the tree with nowhere to go,"
1283,34,
1284,34,"my landscape is a hand with no lines,"
1285,34,"the roads bunched to a knot,"
1286,34,"the knot myself,"
1287,34,
1288,34,myself the rose you acheive---
1289,34,"this body,"
1290,34,this ivory
1291,34,
1292,34,"ungodly as a child's shriek,"
1293,34,"spiderlike, i spin mirrors,"
1294,34,"loyal to my image,"
1295,34,
1296,34,uttering nothing but blood---
1297,34,"taste it, dark red!"
1298,34,and my forest
1299,34,
1300,34,"my funeral,"
1301,34,and this hill and this
1302,34,"gleaming with the mouths of corpses,"
1303,35,"the prince leans to the girl in scarlet heels,"
1304,35,"her green eyes slant, hair flaring in a fan"
1305,35,of silver as the rondo slows; now reels
1306,35,begin on tilted violins to span
1307,35,
1308,35,the whole revolving tall glass palace hall
1309,35,where guests slide gliding into light like wine;
1310,35,rose candles flicker on the lilac wall
1311,35,"reflecting in a million flagons' shine,"
1312,35,
1313,35,and glided couples all in whirling trance
1314,35,"follow holiday revel begun long since,"
1315,35,until near twelve the strange girl all at once
1316,35,"guilt-stricken halts, pales, clings to the prince"
1317,35,
1318,35,as amid the hectic music and cocktail talk
1319,35,"she hears the caustic ticking of the clock,"
1320,36,"color floods to the spot, dull purple,"
1321,36,"the rest of the body is all washed-out,"
1322,36,"the color of pearl,"
1323,36,
1324,36,in a pit of a rock
1325,36,"the sea sucks obsessively,"
1326,36,"one hollow thw whole sea's pivot,"
1327,36,
1328,36,"the size of a fly,"
1329,36,the doom mark
1330,36,"crawls down the wall,"
1331,36,
1332,36,"the heart shuts,"
1333,36,"the sea slides back,"
1334,36,"the mirrors are sheeted,"
1335,37,through portico of my elegant house you stalk
1336,37,"with your wild furies, disturbing garlands of fruit"
1337,37,"and the fabulous lutes and peacocks, rending the net"
1338,37,"of all decorum which holds the whirlwind back,"
1339,37,"now, rich order of walls is fallen; rooks croak"
1340,37,above the appalling ruin; in bleak light
1341,37,"of your stormy eye, magic takes flight"
1342,37,"like a daunted witch, quitting castle when real days break,"
1343,37,
1344,37,fractured pillars frame prospects of rock;
1345,37,"while you stand heroic in coat and tie, i sit"
1346,37,"composed in grecian tunic and psyche-knot,"
1347,37,"rooted to your black look, the play turned tragic,"
1348,37,"which such blight wrought on our bankrupt estate,"
1349,37,
1350,37,what ceremony of words can patch the havoc?
1351,38,"black lake, black boat, two black, cut-paper people,"
1352,38,where do the black trees go that drink here?
1353,38,"their shadows must cover canada,"
1354,38,
1355,38,"a little light is filtering from the water flowers,"
1356,38,"their leaves do not wish us to hurry,"
1357,38,"they are round and flat and full of dark advice,"
1358,38,
1359,38,"cold worlds shake from the oar,"
1360,38,"the spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes,"
1361,38,"a snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand;"
1362,38,
1363,38,"stars open among the lilies,"
1364,38,are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens?
1365,38,"this is the silence of astounded souls,"
1366,39,"gerd sits spindle-shaped in her dark tent,"
1367,39,"lean face gone tawn with seasons ,"
1368,39,skin worn down to the knucklebones
1369,39,at her tough trade; without time's taint
1370,39,"the burnished ball hangs fire in her hands, a lens"
1371,39,"fusing time's three horizons,"
1372,39,
1373,39,"two enter to tap her sight, a green pair"
1374,39,"fresh leaved out in vows, 'come tell"
1375,39,"how we shall do together,"
1376,39,"well or ill,' gerd slants a look at each, most dear,"
1377,39,"each to the other; fit fiber for stern weather,"
1378,39,"slowly she spins the ball,"
1379,39,
1380,39,'i see two stalwart apple trees
1381,39,coupled by branches intertwined

1711,47,"in black november,  after a sliding rain"
1712,47,"dew stood in chill sweat on each stalk,"
1713,47,"each thorn; spiring from wet earth, a blue haze"
1714,47,"hung caught in dark-webbed branches like a fabulous heron,"

1721,47,"'how now,' father shawn crisply addressed the ghost"
1722,47,"wavering there, gauze-edged, smelling of woodsmoke,"
1723,47,'what manner of business are you on?

1777,48,
1778,48,from the comic accident of birth
1779,48,to the final grotesque joke of death

1795,49,backward we traveled to reclaim the day
1796,49,"before we fell, like icarus, undone;"
1797,49,all we find are altars in decay

1833,51,
1834,51,"feet seem to be saying,"
1835,51,"we have come so far, it is over,"
1836,51,
1837,51,"each dead child coiled, a white serpent,"
1838,51,one at each little
1839,51,
1840,51,"pitcher of milk, now empty"
1841,51,she has folded
1842,51,
1843,51,them back into her body as petals
1844,51,of a rose close when the garden
1845,51,
1846,51,stiffens and odors bleed
1847,51,"from the sweet, deep throats of the night flower,"
1848,51,
1849,51,"the moon has nothing to be sad about,"
1850,51,"staring from her hood of bone,"
1851,51,
1852,51,"she is used to this sort of thing,"
1853,51,"her blacks crackle and drag,"
1854,52,"the day you died i went into the dirt,"
1855,52,into the lightless hibernaculum
1856,52,"where bees, striped black and gold, sleep out the blizzard"
1857,52,"like hieratic stones, and the ground is hard,"
1858,52,"it was good for twenty years, that wintering --"
1859,52,"as if you never existed, as if i came"
1860,52,"god-fathered into the world from my mother's belly,"
1861,52,"her wide bed wore the stain of divinity,"
1862,52,i had nothing to do with guilt or anything
1863,52,"when i wormed back under my mother's heart,"
1864,52,
1865,52,small as a doll in my dress of innocence
1866,52,"i lay dreaming your epic, image by image,"
1867,52,"nobody died or withered on that stage,"
1868,52,"everything took place in a durable whiteness,"
1869,52,"the day i woke, i woke on churchyard hill,"
1870,52,"i found your name, i found your bones and all"
1871,52,enlisted in a cramped necropolis
1872,52,"your speckled stone skewed by an iron fence,"
1873,52,
1874,52,"in this charity ward, this poorhouse, where the dead"
1875,52,"crowd foot to foot, head to head, no flower"
1876,52,"breaks the soil, this is azalea path,"
1877,52,"a field of burdock opens to the south,"
1878,52,"six feet of yellow gravel cover you,"
1879,52,the artificial red sage does not stir
1880,52,in the basket of plastic evergreens they put
1881,52,"at the headstone next to yours, nor does it rot,"
1882,52,"although the rains dissolve a bloody dye,"
1883,52,"the ersatz petals drip, and they drip red,"
1884,52,
1885,52,"another kind of redness bothers me,"
1886,52,the day your slack sail drank my sister's breath
1887,52,the flat sea purpled like that evil cloth
1888,52,"my mother unrolled at your last homecoming,"
1889,52,"i borrow the silts of an old tragedy,"
1890,52,"the truth is, one late october, at my birth-cry"
1891,52,"a scorpion stung its head, an ill-starred thing;"
1892,52,"my mother dreamed you face down in the sea,"
1893,52,
1894,52,"the stony actors poise and pause for breath,"
1895,52,"i brought my love to bear, and then you died,"
1896,52,it was the gangrene ate you to the bone
1897,52,"my mother said, you died like any man,"
1898,52,how shall i age into that state of mind?
1899,52,"i am the ghost of an infamous suicide,"
1900,52,"my own blue razor rusting at my throat,"
1901,52,o pardon the one who knocks for pardon at
1902,52,"your gate, father -- your hound-bitch, daughter, friend,"
1903,52,"it was my love that did us both to death,"
1904,53,"i know the bottom, she says,  i know it with my great tap root;"
1905,53," it is what you fear,"
1906,53," i do not fear it, i have been there,"
1907,53,
1908,53," is it the sea you hear in me,"
1909,53, its dissatisfactions?
1910,53," or the voice of nothing, that was you madness?"
1911,53,
1912,53," love is a shadow,"
1913,53," how you lie and cry after it,"
1914,53," listen, these are its hooves, it has gone off, like a horse,"
1915,53,
1916,53," all night i shall gallup thus, impetuously,"
1917,53," till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf,"
1918,53," echoing, echoing,"
1919,53,
1920,53, or shall i bring you the sound of poisons?
1921,53," this is rain now, the big hush,"
1922,53," and this is the fruit of it, tin white, like arsenic,"
1923,53,
1924,53," i have suffered the atrocity of sunsets,"
1925,53, scorched to the root
1926,53," my red filaments burn and stand,a hand of wires,"
1927,53,
1928,53," now i break up in pieces that fly about like clubs,"
1929,53, a wind of such violence
1930,53," will tolerate no bystanding, i must shriek,"
1931,53,
1932,53," the moon, also, is merciless, she would drag me"
1933,53," cruelly, being barren,"
1934,53," her radiance scathes me,  or perhaps i have caught her,"
1935,53,
1936,53," i let her go,  i let her go"
1937,53," diminished and flat, as after radical surgery,"
1938,53," how your bad dreams possess and endow me,"
1939,53,
1940,53," i am inhabited by a cry,"
1941,53, nightly it flaps out
1942,53," looking, with its hooks, for something to love,"
1943,53,
1944,53, i am terrified by this dark thing
1945,53, that sleeps in me;
1946,53," all day i feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity,"
1947,53,
1948,53," clouds pass and disperse,"
1949,53," are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables?"
1950,53, is it for such i agitate my heart?
1951,53,
1952,53," i am incapable of more knowledge,"
1953,53," what is this, this face"
1954,53, so murderous in its strangle of branches?--
1955,53,
1956,53," its snaky acids kiss,"
1957,53," it petrifies the will,  these are the isolate, slow faults"
1958,53," that kill, that kill, that kill,"
1959,54,how the elements solidify! ---
1960,54,"the moonlight, that chalk cliff"
1961,54,in whose rift we lie
1962,54,
1963,54,"back to back, i hear an owl cry"
1964,54,"from its cold indigo,"
1965,54,"intolerable vowels enter my heart,"
1966,54,
1967,54,"the child in the white crib revolves and sighs,"
1968,54,"opens its mouth now, demanding,"
1969,54,"his little face is carved in pained, red wood,"
1970,54,
1971,54,"then there are the stars - ineradicable, hard,"
1972,54,"one touch , it burns and sickens,"
1973,54,"i cannot see your eyes,"
1974,54,
1975,54,where apple bloom ices the night
1976,54,"i walk in a ring,"
1977,54,"a groove of old faults, deep and bitter,"
1978,54,
1979,54,"love cannot come here,"
1980,54,"a black gap discloses itself,"
1981,54,on the opposite lip
1982,54,
1983,54,"a small white soul is waving, a small white maggot,"
1984,54,"my limbs, also, have left me,"
1985,54,who has dismembered us?
1986,54,
1987,54,"the dark is melting, we touch like cripples,"
1988,55,"you bring me good news from the clinic,"
1989,55,"whipping off your silk scarf, exhibiting the tight white"
1990,55,"mummy-cloths, smiling, i'm all right,"
1991,55,"when i was nine, a lime-green anesthetist"
1992,55,"fed me banana-gas through a frog mask,  the nauseous vault"
1993,55,"boomed with bad dreams and the jovian voices of surgeons,"
1994,55,"then mother swam up, holding a tin basin,"
1995,55,"o i was sick,"
1996,55,
1997,55,"they've changed all that,  traveling"
1998,55,"nude as cleopatra in my well-boiled hospital shift,"
1999,55,"fizzy with sedatives and unusually humorous,"
2000,55,i roll to an anteroom where a kind man
2001,55,"fists my fingers for me,  he makes me feel something precious"
2002,55,"is leaking from the finger-vents,  at the count of two,"
2003,55,"darkness wipes me out like chalk on a blackboard, , ,"
2004,55,"i don't know a thing,"
2005,55,
2006,55,"for five days i lie in secret,"
2007,55,"tapped like a cask, the years draining into my pillow,"
2008,55,"even my best friend thinks i'm in the country,"
2009,55,"skin doesn't have roots, it peels away easy as paper,"
2010,55,"when i grin, the stitches tauten,  i grow backward,  i'm twenty,"
2011,55,"broody and in long skirts on my first husband's sofa, my fingers"
2012,55,buried in the lambswool of the dead poodle;
2013,55,"i hadn't a cat yet,"
2014,55,
2015,55,"now she's done for, the dewlapped lady"
2016,55,"i watched settle, line by line, in my mirror—"
2017,55,"old sock-face, sagged on a darning egg,"
2018,55,"they've trapped her in some laboratory jar,"
2019,55,"let her die there, or wither incessantly for the next fifty years,"
2020,55,"nodding and rocking and fingering her thin hair,"
2021,55,"mother to myself, i wake swaddled in gauze,"
2022,55,"pink and smooth as a baby,"
2023,56,outside in the street i hear
2024,56,a car door slam; voices coming near;
2025,56,incoherent scraps of talk
2026,56,and high heels clicking up the walk;
2027,56,the doorbell rends the noonday heat
2028,56,with copper claws;
2029,56,"a second's pause,"
2030,56,the dull drums of my pulses beat
2031,56,"against a silence wearing thin,"
2032,56,"the door now opens from within,"
2033,56,"oh, hear the clash of people meeting ---"
2034,56,"the laughter and the screams of greeting ,"
2035,56,
2036,56,"fat always, and out of breath,"
2037,56,a greasy smack on every cheek
2038,56,from aunt elizabeth;
2039,56,"there, that's the pink, pleased squeak"
2040,56,"of cousin jane, out spinster with"
2041,56,the faded eyes
2042,56,and hands like nervous butterflies;
2043,56,while rough as splintered wood
2044,56,across them all
2045,56,rasps the jarring baritone of uncle paul;
2046,56,the youngest nephew gives a fretful whine
2047,56,"and drools at the reception line,"
2048,56,
2049,56,like a diver on a lofty spar of land
2050,56,"atop the flight of stairs i stand,"
2051,56,"a whirlpool leers at me,"
2052,56,i cast off my identity
2053,56,"and make the fatal plunge,"
2054,57,"haunched like a faun, he hooed"
2055,57,from grove of moon-glint and fen-frost
2056,57,until all owls in the twigged forest
2057,57,flapped black to look and brood
2058,57,"on the call this man made,"
2059,57,
2060,57,no sound but a drunken coot
2061,57,"lurching home along river bank,"
2062,57,"stars hung water-sunk, so a rank"
2063,57,of double star-eyes lit
2064,57,"boughs where those owls sat,"
2065,57,
2066,57,an arena of yellow eyes
2067,57,"watched the changing shape he cut,"
2068,57,"saw hoof harden from foot, saw sprout"
2069,57,"goat-horns,  marked how god rose"
2070,57,"and galloped woodward in that guise,"
2071,58,"all day she plays at chess with the bones of the world,"
2072,58,favored while suddenly the rains begin
2073,58,beyond the window she lies on cushions curled
2074,58,"and nibbles an occasional bonbon of sin,"
2075,58,
2076,58,"prim, pink-breasted, feminine, she nurses"
2077,58,chocolate fancies in rose-papered rooms
2078,58,where polished higboys whisper creaking curses
2079,58,"and hothouse roses shed immortal blooms,"
2080,58,
2081,58,the garnets on her fingers twinkle quick
2082,58,and blood reflects across the manuscript;
2083,58,"she muses on the odor, sweet and sick,"
2084,58,"of festering gardenias in a crypt,"
2085,58,
2086,58,"and lost in subtle metaphor, retreats"
2087,58,"from gray child faces crying in the streets,"
2088,59,pure? what does it mean?
2089,59,the tongues of hell
2090,59,"are dull, dull as the triple"
2091,59,
2092,59,"tongues of dull, fat cerebus"
2093,59,"who wheezes at the gate, incapable"
2094,59,of licking clean
2095,59,
2096,59,"the aguey tendon, the sin, the sin,"
2097,59,"the tinder cries,"
2098,59,the indelible smell
2099,59,
2100,59,of a snuffed candle!
2101,59,"love, love, the low smokes roll"
2102,59,"from me like isadora's scarves, i'm in a fright"
2103,59,
2104,59,"one scarf will catch and anchor in the wheel,"
2105,59,such yellow sullen smokes
2106,59,"make their own element, they will not rise,"
2107,59,
2108,59,but trundle round the globe
2109,59,"choking the aged and the meek,"
2110,59,the weak
2111,59,
2112,59,"hothouse baby in its crib,"
2113,59,the ghastly orchid
2114,59,"hanging its hanging garden in the air,"
2115,59,
2116,59,devilish leopard!
2117,59,radiation turned it white
2118,59,"and killed it in an hour,"
2119,59,
2120,59,greasing the bodies of adulterers
2121,59,"like hiroshima ash and eating in,"
2122,59,"the sin, the sin,"
2123,59,
2124,59,"darling, all night"
2125,59,"i have been flickering, off, on, off, on,"
2126,59,"the sheets grow heavy as a lecher's kiss,"
2127,59,
2128,59,"three days, three nights,"
2129,59,"lemon water, chicken"
2130,59,"water, water make me retch,"
2131,59,

2269,63,
2270,63,the molts are tongueless that sang from above the water

2274,64,"you will be aware of an absence, presently,"
2275,64,"growing beside you, like a tree,"
2276,64,"a death tree, color gone, an australian gum tree ---"
2277,64,"balding, gelded by lightning--an illusion,"
2278,64,"and a sky like a pig's backside, an utter lack of attention,"
2279,64,"but right now you are dumb,"
2280,64,"and i love your stupidity,"
2281,64,"the blind mirror of it, i look in"
2282,64,"and find no face but my own, and you think that's funny,"
2283,64,it is good for me
2284,64,"to have you grab my nose, a ladder rung,"
2285,64,one day you may touch what's wrong ---
2286,64,"the small skulls, the smashed blue hills, the godawful hush,"
2287,64,"till then your smiles are found money,"
2288,65,"summer grows old, cold-blooded mother,"
2289,65,"the insects are scant, skinny,"

2305,66,
2306,66,"capped, white hair, white beard, far-flung,"

2314,66,the old myth of orgins
2315,66,"unimaginable, you float near"

2318,66,"of the north, to be steered clear"

2324,66,some strange injury
2325,66,
2326,66,"and seems to die, so vapors"
2327,66,"ravel to clearness on the dawn sea,"
2328,66,the muddy rumors
2329,66,
2330,66,of your burial move me
2331,66,"to half-believe, your reappearance"
2332,66,"proves rumors shallow,"
2333,66,
2334,66,for the archaic trenched lines
2335,66,"of your grained face shed time in runnels,"
2336,66,ages beat like rains
2337,66,
2338,66,on the unbeaten channels
2339,66,"of the ocean, such sage humor and"

2343,66,"work of the earth and the sky's ridgepole,"
2344,66,"waist down, you may wind"
2345,66,
2346,66,one labyrinthine tangle

2348,66,"skulls, inscrutable,"
2349,66,
2350,66,below shoulders not once
2351,66,"seen by any man who kept his head,"
2352,66,you defy questions;
2353,66,
2354,66,"you defy godhood,"
2355,66,i walk dry on your kingdom's border

2357,66,
2358,66,"your shelled bed i remember,"
2359,66,"father, this thick air is murderous,"
2360,66,"i would breathe water,"
2361,67,how far is it?
2362,67,how far is it now?
2363,67,the gigantic gorilla interior
2364,67,"of the wheels move, they appall me ---"
2365,67,the terrible brains
2366,67,"of krupp, black muzzles"
2367,67,"revolving, the sound"
2368,67,"punching out absence! like cannon,"
2369,67,"it is russia i have to get across, it is some was or other,"
2370,67,i am dragging my body
2371,67,"quietly through the straw of the boxcars,"
2372,67,"now is the time for bribery,"
2373,67,"what do wheels eat, these wheels"
2374,67,"fixed to their arcs like gods,"
2375,67,the silver leash of the will ----
2376,67,"inexorable, and their pride!"
2377,67,"all the gods know destinations,"
2378,67,i am a letter in this slot!
2379,67,"i fly to a name, two eyes,"
2380,67,"will there be fire, will there be bread?"
2381,67,"here there is such mud,"
2382,67,"it is a trainstop, the nurses"
2383,67,"undergoing the faucet water, its veils, veils in a nunnery,"
2384,67,"touching their wounded,"
2385,67,"the men the blood still pumps forward,"
2386,67,"legs, arms piled outside"
2387,67,the tent of unending cries ----
2388,67,"a hospital of dolls,"
2389,67,"and the men, what is left of the men"
2390,67,"pumped ahead by these pistons, this blood"
2391,67,"into the next mile,"
2392,67,the next hour ----
2393,67,dynasty of broken arrows!
2394,67,
2395,67,how far is it?
2396,67,"there is mud on my feet,"
2397,67,"thick, red and slipping, it is adam's side,"
2398,67,"this earth i rise from, and i in agony,"
2399,67,"i cannot undo myself, and the train is steaming,"
2400,67,"steaming and breathing, its teeth"
2401,67,"ready to roll, like a devil's,"
2402,67,there is a minute at the end of it
2403,67,"a minute, a dewdrop,"
2404,67,how far is it?
2405,67,it is so small
2406,67,"the place i am getting to, why are there these obstacles ----"
2407,67,"the body of this woman,"
2408,67,charred skirts and deathmask
2409,67,"mourned by religious figures, by garlanded children,"
2410,67,and now detonations ----
2411,67,"thunder and guns,"
2412,67,"the fire's between us,"
2413,67,is there no place
2414,67,"turning and turning in the middle air,"
2415,67,"untouchable and untouchable,"
2416,67,"the train is dragging itself, it is screaming ----"
2417,67,an animal
2418,67,"insane for the destination,"
2419,67,"the bloodspot,"
2420,67,"the face at the end of the flare,"
2421,67,"i shall bury the wounded like pupas,"
2422,67,"i shall count and bury the dead,"
2423,67,"let their souls writhe in like dew,"
2424,67,"incense in my track,"
2425,67,"the carriages rock, they are cradles,"
2426,67,"and i, stepping from this skin"
2427,67,"of old bandages, boredoms, old faces"
2428,67,
2429,67,"step up to you from the black car of lethe,"
2430,67,"pure as a baby,"
2431,68,"pocket watch, i tick well,"
2432,68,the streets are lizardly crevices
2433,68,"sheer-sided, with holes where to hide,"
2434,68,"it is best to meet in a cul-de-sac,"
2435,68,
2436,68,a palace of velvet
2437,68,"with windows of mirrors,"
2438,68,"there one is safe,"
2439,68,"there are no family photographs,"
2440,68,
2441,68,"no rings through the nose, no cries,"
2442,68,"bright fish hooks, the smiles of women"
2443,68,gulp at my bulk
2444,68,"and i, in my snazzy blacks,"
2445,68,
2446,68,"mill a litter of breasts like jellyfish,"
2447,68,to nourish
2448,68,the cellos of moans i eat eggs --
2449,68,"eggs and fish, the essentials,"
2450,68,
2451,68,"the aphrodisiac squid,"
2452,68,"my mouth sags,"
2453,68,the mouth of christ
2454,68,"when my engine reaches the end of it,"
2455,68,
2456,68,the tattle of my
2457,68,"gold joints, my way of turning"
2458,68,bitches to ripples of silver
2459,68,"rolls out a carpet, a hush,"
2460,68,
2461,68,"and there is no end, no end of it,"
2462,68,"i shall never grow old, new oysters"
2463,68,shriek in the sea and i
2464,68,glitter like fontainebleu
2465,68,
2466,68,"gratified,"
2467,68,all the fall of water an eye
2468,68,over whose pool i tenderly
2469,68,"lean and see me,"
2470,69,old goatherds swear how all night long they hear
2471,69,the warning whirr and burring of the bird
2472,69,who wakes with darkness and till dawn works hard
2473,69,"vampiring dry of milk each great goat udder,"
2474,69,"moon full, moon dark, the chary dairy farmer"
2475,69,"dreams that his fattest cattle dwindle, fevered"
2476,69,"by claw-cuts of the goatsucker, alias devil-bird,"
2477,69,"its eye, flashlit, a chip of ruby fire,"
2478,69,
2479,69,"so fables say the goatsucker moves, masked from men's sight"
2480,69,"in an ebony air, on wings of witch cloth,"
2481,69,"well-named, ill-famed a knavish fly-by-night,"
2482,69,"yet it never milked any goat, nor dealt cow death"
2483,69,and shadows only--cave-mouth bristle beset--
2484,69,"cockchafers and the wan, green luna moth,"
2485,70,gold mouths cry with the green young
2486,70,certainty of the bronze boy
2487,70,remembering a thousand autumns
2488,70,and how a hundred thousand leaves
2489,70,came sliding down his shoulder blades
2490,70,"persuaded by his bronze heroic reason,"
2491,70,we ignore the coming doom of gold
2492,70,"and we are glad in this bright metal season,"
2493,70,"even the dead laugh among the goldenrod,"
2494,70,
2495,70,"the bronze boy stands kneedeep in centuries,"
2496,70,"and never grieves,"
2497,70,"remembering a thousand autumns,"
2498,70,with sunlight of a thousand years upon his lips
2499,70,"and his eyes gone blind with leaves,"
2500,71,over your body the clouds go
2501,71,"high, high and icily"
2502,71,"and a little flat, as if they"
2503,71,
2504,71,"unlike swans,"
2505,71,having no reflections;
2506,71,
2507,71,"unlike you,"
2508,71,"with no strings attached,"
2509,71,"all cool, all blue, unlike you ---"
2510,71,
2511,71,"you, there on your back,"
2512,71,"eyes to the sky,"
2513,71,"the spider-men have caught you,"
2514,71,
2515,71,"winding and twining their petty fetters,"
2516,71,their bribes ---
2517,71,"so many silks,"
2518,71,
2519,71,"how they hate you,"
2520,71,"they converse in the valley of your fingers, they are inchworms,"
2521,71,"they would have you sleep in their cabinets,"
2522,71,
2523,71,"this tow and that toe, a relic,"
2524,71,step off!
2525,71,"step off seven leagues, like those distances"
2526,71,
2527,71,"that revolve in crivelli, untouchable,"
2528,71,"let this eye be an eagle,"
2529,71,"the shadow of his lip, an abyss,"
2530,72,"flintlike, her feet struck"
2531,72,"such a racket of echoes from the steely street,"
2532,72,tacking in moon-blued crooks from the black
2533,72,"stone-built town, that she heard the quick air ignite"
2534,72,its tinder and shake
2535,72,
2536,72,a firework of echoes from wall
2537,72,"to wall of the dark, dwarfed cottages,"
2538,72,but the echoes died at her back as the walls
2539,72,gave way to fields and the incessant seethe of grasses
2540,72,riding in the full
2541,72,
2542,72,"of the moon, manes to the wind,"
2543,72,"tireless, tied, as a moon-bound sea"
2544,72,"moves on its root, though a mist-wraith wound"
2545,72,up from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high
2546,72,"ahead, it fattened"
2547,72,
2548,72,"to no family-featured ghost,"
2549,72,nor did any word body with a name
2550,72,"the blank mood she walked in, once past"
2551,72,"the dream-peopled village, her eyes entertained no dream,"
2552,72,and the sandman's dust
2553,72,
2554,72,"lost luster under her footsoles,"
2555,72,"the long wind, paring her person down"
2556,72,"to a pinch of flame, blew its burdened whistle"
2557,72,"in the whorl of her ear, and like a scooped-out pumpkin crown"
2558,72,"her head cupped the babel,"
2559,72,
2560,72,"all the night gave her, in return"
2561,72,for the paltry gift of her bulk and the beat
2562,72,of her heart was the humped indifferent iron
2563,72,"of its hills, and its pastures bordered by black stone set"
2564,72,"on black stone, barns"
2565,72,
2566,72,guarded broods and litters
2567,72,behind shut doors; the dairy herds
2568,72,knelt in the meadow mute as boulders;
2569,72,"sheep drowsed stoneward in their tussocks of wool, and birds,"
2570,72,"twig-sleep, wore"
2571,72,
2572,72,"granite ruffs, their shadows"
2573,72,"the guise of leaves, the whole landscape"
2574,72,loomed absolute as the antique world was
2575,72,"once in its earliest sway of lymph and sap,"
2576,72,"unaltered by eyes,"
2577,72,
2578,72,enough to snuff the quick
2579,72,"of her small heat out, but before the weight"
2580,72,of stones and hills of stones could break
2581,72,her down to mere quartz grit n that stony light
2582,72,"she turned back,"
2583,73,"irrefutable, beautifully smug"
2584,73,"as venus, pedestalled on a half-shell"
2585,73,shawled in blond hair and the salt
2586,73,"scrim of a sea breeze, the women"
2587,73,"settle in their belling dresses,"
2588,73,over each weighty stomach a face
2589,73,"floats calm as a moon or a cloud,"
2590,73,
2591,73,"smiling to themselves, they meditate"
2592,73,devoutly as the dutch bulb
2593,73,"forming its twenty petals,"
2594,73,"the dark still nurses its secret,"
2595,73,"on the green hill, under the thorn trees,"
2596,73,"they listen for the millennium,"
2597,73,"the knock of the small, new heart,"
2598,73,
2599,73,"pink-buttoned infants attend them,"
2600,73,"looping wool, doing nothing in particular,"
2601,73,"they step among the archetypes,"
2602,73,dusk hoods them in mary-blue
2603,73,"while far off, the axle of winter"
2604,73,"grinds round, bearing down the straw,"
2605,73,"the star, the wise grey men,"
2606,74,"but i would rather be horizontal,"
2607,74,i am not a tree with my root in the soil
2608,74,sucking up minerals and motherly love
2609,74,"so that each march i may gleam into leaf,"
2610,74,nor am i the beauty of a garden bed
2611,74,"attracting my share of ahs and spectacularly painted,"
2612,74,"unknowing i must soon unpetal,"
2613,74,"compared with me, a tree is immortal"
2614,74,"and a flower-head not tall, but more startling,"
2615,74,"and i want the one's longevity and the other's daring,"
2616,74,
2617,74,"tonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars,"
2618,74,"the trees and flowers have been strewing their cool odors,"
2619,74,"i walk among them, but none of them are noticing,"
2620,74,sometimes i think that when i am sleeping
2621,74,i must most perfectly resemble them--
2622,74,"thoughts gone dim,"
2623,74,"it is more natural to me, lying down,"
2624,74,"then the sky and i are in open conversation,"
2625,74,"and i shall be useful when i lie down finally,"
2626,74,"the the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me,"
2627,75,"open-mouthed, the baby god"
2628,75,"immense, bald, though baby-headed,"
2629,75,"cried out for the mother's dug,"
2630,75,"the dry volcanoes cracked and split,"
2631,75,
2632,75,"sand abraded the milkless lip,"
2633,75,cried then for the father's blood
2634,75,"who set wasp, wolf and shark to work,"
2635,75,"engineered the gannet's beak,"
2636,75,
2637,75,"dry-eyed, the inveterate patriarch"
2638,75,"raised his men of skin and bone,"
2639,75,"barbs on the crown of gilded wire,"
2640,75,"thorns on the bloody rose-stem,"
2641,76,"i shall never get out of this!  there are two of me now,"
2642,76,"this new absolutely white person and the old yellow one,"
2643,76,"and the white person is certainly the superior one,"
2644,76,"she doesn't need food, she is one of the real saints,"
2645,76,"at the beginning i hated her, she had no personality --"
2646,76,she lay in bed with me like a dead body
2647,76,"and i was scared, because she was shaped just the way i was"
2648,76,
2649,76,"only much whiter and unbreakable and with no complaints,"
2650,76,"i couldn't sleep for a week, she was so cold,"
2651,76,"i blamed her for everything, but she didn't answer,"
2652,76,i couldn't understand her stupid behavior!
2653,76,"when i hit her she held still, like a true pacifist,"
2654,76,"then i realized what she wanted was for me to love her,"
2655,76,"she began to warm up, and i saw her advantages,"
2656,76,
2657,76,"without me, she wouldn't exist, so of course she was grateful,"
2658,76,"i gave her a soul, i bloomed out of her as a rose"
2659,76,"blooms out of a vase of not very valuable porcelain,"
2660,76,"and it was i who attracted everybody's attention,"
2661,76,"not her whiteness and beauty, as i had at first supposed,"
2662,76,"i patronized her a little, and she lapped it up --"
2663,76,"you could tell almost at once she had a slave mentality,"
2664,76,
2665,76,"i didn't mind her waiting on me, and she adored it,"
2666,76,"in the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun"
2667,76,"from her amazingly white torso, and i couldn't help but notice"
2668,76,"her tidiness and her calmness and her patience,"
2669,76,"she humored my weakness like the best of nurses,"
2670,76,"holding my bones in place so they would mend properly,"
2671,76,"in time our relationship grew more intense,"
2672,76,
2673,76,"she stopped fitting me so closely and seemed offish,"
2674,76,"i felt her criticizing me in spite of herself,"
2675,76,"as if my habits offended her in some way,"
2676,76,"she let in the drafts and became more and more absent-minded,"
2677,76,and my skin itched and flaked away in soft pieces
2678,76,"simply because she looked after me so badly,"
2679,76,"then i saw what the trouble was,  she thought she was immortal,"
2680,76,
2681,76,"she wanted to leave me, she thought she was superior,"
2682,76,"and i'd been keeping her in the dark, and she was resentful --"
2683,76,wasting her days waiting on a half-corpse!
2684,76,"and secretly she began to hope i'd die,"
2685,76,"then she could cover my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,"
2686,76,and wear my painted face the way a mummy-case
2687,76,"wears the face of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water,"
2688,76,
2689,76,"i wasn't in any position to get rid of her,"
2690,76,she'd supported me for so long i was quite limp --
2691,76,"i had forgotten how to walk or sit,"
2692,76,so i was careful not to upset her in any way
2693,76,"or brag ahead of time how i'd avenge myself,"
2694,76,"living with her was like living with my own coffin,"
2695,76,"yet i still depended on her, though i did it regretfully,"
2696,76,
2697,76,i used to think we might make a go of it together --
2698,76,"after all, it was a kind of marriage, being so close,"
2699,76,"now i see it must be one or the other of us,"
2700,76,"she may be a saint, and i may be ugly and hairy,"
2701,76,"but she'll soon find out that that doesn't matter a bit,"
2702,76,"i'm collecting my strength; one day i shall manage without her,"
2703,76,"and she'll perish with emptiness then, and begin to miss me,"
2704,77,the groundhog on the mountain did not run
2705,77,but fatly scuttled into the splayed fern
2706,77,"and faced me, back to a ledge of dirt, to rattle"
2707,77,her sallow rodent teeth like castanets
2708,77,"against my leaning down, would not exchange"
2709,77,for that wary clatter sound or gesture
2710,77,"of love , claws braced, at bay, my currency not hers,"
2711,77,
2712,77,such meetings never occur in marchen
2713,77,"where love-met groundhogs love one in return,"
2714,77,"where straight talk is the rule, whether warm or hostile,"
2715,77,"which no gruff animal misinterprets,"
2716,77,"from what grace am i fallen, tongues are strange,"
2717,77,"signs say nothing, the falcon who spoke clear"
2718,77,"to canacee cries gibberish to coarsened ears,"
2719,78,"the night is only a sort of carbon paper,"
2720,78,"blueblack, with the much-poked periods of stars"
2721,78,"letting in the light, peephole after peephole , , ,"
2722,78,"a bonewhite light, like death, behind all things,"
2723,78,under the eyes of the stars and the moon's rictus
2724,78,"he suffers his desert pillow, sleeplessness"
2725,78,"stretching its fine, irritating sand in all directions,"
2726,78,
2727,78,"over and over the old, granular movie"
2728,78,exposes embarrassments--the mizzling days
2729,78,"of childhood and adolescence, sticky with dreams,"
2730,78,"parental faces on tall stalks, alternately stern and tearful,"
2731,78,"a garden of buggy rose that made him cry,"
2732,78,"his forehead is bumpy as a sack of rocks,"
2733,78,"memories jostle each other for face-room like obsolete film stars,"
2734,78,
2735,78,"he is immune to pills, red, purple, blue , , ,"
2736,78,how they lit the tedium of the protracted evening!
2737,78,those sugary planets whose influence won for him
2738,78,"a life baptized in no-life for a while,"
2739,78,"and the sweet, drugged waking of a forgetful baby,"
2740,78,"now the pills are worn-out and silly, like classical gods,"
2741,78,"their poppy-sleepy colors do him no good,"
2742,78,
2743,78,"his head is a little interior of grey mirrors,"
2744,78,each gesture flees immediately down an alley
2745,78,"of diminishing perspectives, and its significance"
2746,78,"drains like water out the hole at the far end,"
2747,78,"he lives without privacy in a lidless room,"
2748,78,the bald slots of his eyes stiffened wide-open
2749,78,"on the incessant heat-lightning flicker of situations,"
2750,78,
2751,78,"nightlong, in the granite yard, invisible cats"
2752,78,"have been howling like women, or damaged instruments,"
2753,78,"already he can feel daylight, his white disease,"
2754,78,"creeping up with her hatful of trivial repetitions,"
2755,78,"the city is a map of cheerful twitters now,"
2756,78,"and everywhere people, eyes mica-silver and blank,"
2757,78,"are riding to work in rows, as if recently brainwashed,"
2758,79,"my thoughts are crabbed and sallow,"
2759,79,"my tears like vinegar,"
2760,79,or the bitter blinking yellow
2761,79,"of an acetic star,"
2762,79,
2763,79,"tonight the caustic wind, love,"
2764,79,"gossips late and soon,"
2765,79,and i wear the wry-faced pucker of
2766,79,"the sour lemon moon,"
2767,79,
2768,79,"while like an early summer plum,"
2769,79,"puny, green, and tart,"
2770,79,droops upon its wizened stem
2771,79,"my lean, unripened heart,"
2772,80,"kindness glides about my house,"
2773,80,"dame kindness, she is so nice!"
2774,80,the blue and red jewels of her rings smoke
2775,80,"in the windows, the mirrors"
2776,80,"are filling with smiles,"
2777,80,
2778,80,what is so real as the cry of a child?
2779,80,a rabbit's cry may be wilder
2780,80,"but it has no soul,"
2781,80,"sugar can cure everything, so kindness says,"
2782,80,"sugar is a necessary fluid,"
2783,80,"its crystals a little poultice,"
2784,80,
2785,80,"o kindness, kindness"
2786,80,sweetly picking up pieces!
2787,80,"my japanese silks, desperate butterflies,"
2788,80,"may be pinned any minute, anesthetized,"
2789,80,
2790,80,"and here you come, with a cup of tea"
2791,80,"wreathed in steam,"
2792,80,"the blood jet is poetry,"
2793,80,"there is no stopping it,"
2794,80,"you hand me two children, two roses,"
2795,81,"i have done it again,"
2796,81,  one year in every ten
2797,81,  i manage it----
2798,81,
2799,81,"  a sort of walking miracle, my skin"
2800,81,"  bright as a nazi lampshade,"
2801,81,  my right foot
2802,81,
2803,81,"  a paperweight,"
2804,81,"  my face a featureless, fine"
2805,81,"  jew linen,"
2806,81,
2807,81,  peel off the napkin
2808,81,"  0 my enemy,"
2809,81,  do i terrify?----
2810,81,
2811,81,"  the nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?"
2812,81,  the sour breath
2813,81,"  will vanish in a day,"
2814,81,
2815,81,"  soon, soon the flesh"
2816,81,  the grave cave ate will be
2817,81,  at home on me
2818,81,
2819,81,"  and i a smiling woman,"
2820,81,"  i am only thirty,"
2821,81,"  and like the cat i have nine times to die,"
2822,81,
2823,81,"  this is number three,"
2824,81,  what a trash
2825,81,"  to annihilate each decade,"
2826,81,
2827,81,"  what a million filaments,"
2828,81,  the peanut-crunching crowd
2829,81,  shoves in to see
2830,81,
2831,81,  them unwrap me hand and foot
2832,81,"  the big strip tease,"
2833,81,"  gentlemen, ladies"
2834,81,
2835,81,  these are my hands
2836,81,"  my knees,"
2837,81,"  i may be skin and bone,"
2838,81,
2839,81,"  nevertheless, i am the same, identical woman,"
2840,81,"  the first time it happened i was ten,"
2841,81,"  it was an accident,"
2842,81,
2843,81,  the second time i meant
2844,81,"  to last it out and not come back at all,"
2845,81,  i rocked shut
2846,81,
2847,81,"  as a seashell,"
2848,81,  they had to call and call
2849,81,"  and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls,"
2850,81,
2851,81,  dying
2852,81,"  is an art, like everything else,"
2853,81,"  i do it exceptionally well,"
2854,81,
2855,81,"  i do it so it feels like hell,"
2856,81,"  i do it so it feels real,"
2857,81,"  i guess you could say i've a call,"
2858,81,
2859,81,"  it's easy enough to do it in a cell,"
2860,81,"  it's easy enough to do it and stay put,"
2861,81,  it's the theatrical
2862,81,
2863,81,  comeback in broad day
2864,81,"  to the same place, the same face, the same brute"
2865,81,"  amused shout,"
2866,81,
2867,81,  'a miracle!'
2868,81,"  that knocks me out,"
2869,81,  there is a charge
2870,81,
2871,81,"  for the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge"
2872,81,  for the hearing of my heart----
2873,81,"  it really goes,"
2874,81,
2875,81,"  and there is a charge, a very large charge"
2876,81,  for a word or a touch
2877,81,  or a bit of blood
2878,81,
2879,81,"  or a piece of my hair or my clothes,"

2889,81,"  do not think i underestimate your great concern,"
2890,81,
2891,81,"  ash, ash ---"
2892,81,"  you poke and stir,"
2893,81,"  flesh, bone, there is nothing there----"
2894,81,
2895,81,"  a cake of soap,"
2896,81,"  a wedding ring,"

2902,81,
2903,81,  out of the ash
2904,81,  i rise with my red hair

2906,82,the sting of bees took away my father
2907,82,who walked in a swarming shroud of wings
2908,82,"and scorned the tick of the falling weather,"
2909,82,
2910,82,lightning licked in a yellow lather
2911,82,"but missed the mark with snaking fangs,"
2912,82,"the sting of bees too away my father,"
2913,82,
2914,82,"trouncing the sea like a ragin bather,"
2915,82,he rode the flood in a pride of prongs
2916,82,"and scorned the tick of the falling weather,"
2917,82,
2918,82,"a scowl of sun struck down my mother,"
2919,82,"tolling her grave with golden gongs,"
2920,82,"but the sting of bees took away my father,"
2921,82,
2922,82,"he counted the guns of god a bother,"
2923,82,"laughed at the ambush of angels' tongues,"
2924,82,"and scorned the tick of the falling weather,"
2925,82,
2926,82,o ransack the four winds and find another
2927,82,"man who can mangle the grin of kings,"
2928,82,the sting of bees took away my father
2929,82,"who scorned the tick of the falling weather,"
2930,83,from my rented attic with no earth
2931,83,"to call my own except the air-motes,"
2932,83,i malign the leaden perspective
2933,83,"of identical gray brick houses,"
2934,83,"orange roof-tiles, orange chimney pots,"
2935,83,"and see that first house, as if between"
2936,83,"mirrors, engendering a spectral"
2937,83,"corridor of inane replicas,"
2938,83,"flimsily peopled,"
2939,83,                 but landowners
2940,83,"own thier cabbage roots, a space of stars,"
2941,83,"indigenous peace, such substance makes"
2942,83,my eyeful of reflections a ghost's
2943,83,"eyeful, which, envious,would define"
2944,83,death as striking root on one land-tract;
2945,83,"life, its own vaporous wayfarings,"
2946,84,"i do not want a plain box, i want a sarcophagus"
2947,84,"with tigery stripes, and a face on it"
2948,84,"round as the moon, to stare up,"
2949,84,i want to be looking at them when they come
2950,84,"picking among the dumb minerals, the roots,"
2951,84,"i see them already -- the pale, star-distance faces,"
2952,84,"now they are nothing, they are not even babies,"
2953,84,"i imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the first gods,"
2954,84,"they will wonder if i was important,"
2955,84,i should sugar and preserve my days like fruit!
2956,84,my mirror is clouding over --
2957,84,"a few more breaths, and it will reflect nothing at all,"
2958,84,"the flowers and the faces whiten to a sheet,"
2959,84,
2960,84,"i do not trust the spirit, it escapes like steam"
2961,84,"in dreams, through mouth-hole or eye-hole, i can't stop it,"
2962,84,"one day it won't come back, things aren't like that,"
2963,84,"they stay, their little particular lusters"
2964,84,"warmed by much handling, they almost purr,"
2965,84,"when the soles of my feet grow cold,"
2966,84,"the blue eye of my tortoise will comfort me,"
2967,84,"let me have my copper cooking pots, let my rouge pots"
2968,84,"bloom about me like night flowers, with a good smell,"
2969,84,"they will roll me up in bandages, they will store my heart"
2970,84,"under my feet in a neat parcel,"
2971,84,"i shall hardly know myself, it will be dark,"
2972,84,"and the shine of these small things sweeter than the face of ishtar,"
2973,85,"lady, your room is lousy with flowers,"
2974,85,"when you kick me out, that's what i'll remember,"
2975,85,"me, sitting here bored as a loepard"
2976,85,"in your jungle of wine-bottle lamps,"
2977,85,velvet pillows the color of blood pudding
2978,85,"and the white china flying fish from italy,"
2979,85,"i forget you, hearing the cut flowers"
2980,85,"sipping their liquids from assorted pots,"
2981,85,pitchers and coronation goblets
2982,85,"like monday drunkards, the milky berries"
2983,85,"bow down, a local constellation,"
2984,85,"toward their admirers in the tabletop,"
2985,85,"mobs of eyeballs looking up,"
2986,85,are those petals of leaves you've paried with them ---
2987,85,those green-striped ovals of silver tissue?
2988,85,"the red geraniums i know,"
2989,85,"friends, friends, they stink of armpits"
2990,85,"and the invovled maladies of autumn,"
2991,85,"musky as a lovebed the morning after,"
2992,85,"my nostrils prickle with nostalgia,"
2993,85,"henna hags,cloth of your cloth,"
2994,85,"they tow old water thick as fog,"
2995,85,
2996,85,the roses in the toby jug
2997,85,"gave up the ghost last night, high time,"
2998,85,"their yellow corsets were ready to split,"
2999,85,"you snored, and i heard the petals unlatch,"
3000,85,"tapping and ticking like nervous fingers,"
3001,85,"you should have junked them before they died,"
3002,85,daybreak discovered the bureau lid
3003,85,"littered with chinese hands, now i'm stared at"
3004,85,by chrysanthemums the size
3005,85,"of holofernes' head, dipped in the same"
3006,85,"magenta as this fubsy sofa,"
3007,85,"in the mirror their doubles back them up,"
3008,85,"listen, your tenant mice"
3009,85,"are rattling the cracker packets, fine flour"
3010,85,"muffles their bird feet, they whistle for joy,"
3011,85,"and you doze on, nose to the wall,"
3012,85,"this mizzle fits me like a sad jacket,"
3013,85,how did we make it up to your attic?
3014,85,"you handed me gin in a glass bud vase,"
3015,85,"we slept like stones, lady, what am i doing"
3016,85,"with a lung full of dust and a tongue of wood,"
3017,85,knee-deep in the cold swamped by flowers?
3018,86,viciousness in the kitchen!
3019,86,"the potatoes hiss,"
3020,86,"it is all hollywood, windowless,"
3021,86,"the fluorescent light wincing on and off like a terrible migraine,"
3022,86,coy paper strips for doors --
3023,86,"stage curtains, a widow’s frizz,"
3024,86,"and i, love, am a pathological liar,"
3025,86,"and my child -- look at her, face down on the floor,"
3026,86,"little unstrung puppet, kicking to disappear --"
3027,86,"why she is schizophrenic,"
3028,86,"her face is red and white, a panic,"
3029,86,you have stuck her kittens outside your window
3030,86,in a sort of cement well
3031,86,"where they crap and puke and cry and she can’t hear,"
3032,86,"you say you can’t stand her,"
3033,86,"the bastard’s a girl,"
3034,86,you who have blown your tubes like a bad radio
3035,86,"clear of voices and history, the staticky"
3036,86,"noise of the new,"
3037,86,"you say i should drown the kittens, their smell!"
3038,86,"you say i should drown my girl,"
3039,86,"she’ll cut her throat at ten if she’s mad at two,"
3040,86,"the baby smiles, fat snail,"
3041,86,"from the polished lozenges of orange linoleum,"
3042,86,"you could eat him, he’s a boy,"
3043,86,"you say your husband is just no good to you,"
3044,86,"his jew-mama guards his sweet sex like a pearl,"
3045,86,"you have one baby, i have two,"
3046,86,"i should sit on a rock off cornwall and comb my hair,"
3047,86,"i should wear tiger pants, i should have an affair,"
3048,86,"we should meet in another life, we should meet in air,"
3049,86,"me and you,"
3050,86,
3051,86,"meanwhile there’s a stink of fat and baby crap,"
3052,86,"i’m doped and thick from my last sleeping pill,"
3053,86,"the smog of cooking, the smog of hell"
3054,86,"floats our heads, two venemous opposites,"
3055,86,"our bones, our hair,"
3056,86,"i call you orphan, orphan, you are ill,"
3057,86,"the sun gives you ulcers, the wind gives you t,b,"
3058,86,"once you were beautiful,"
3059,86,"in new york, in hollywood, the men said, 'through?"
3060,86,"gee baby, you are rare,'"
3061,86,"you acted, acted for the thrill,"
3062,86,"the impotent husband slumps out for a coffee,"
3063,86,"i try to keep him in,"
3064,86,"an old pole for the lightning,"
3065,86,"the acid baths, the skyfuls off of you,"
3066,86,"he lumps it down the plastic cobbled hill,"
3067,86,"flogged trolley, the sparks are blue,"
3068,86,"the blue sparks spill,"
3069,86,"splitting like quartz into a million bits,"
3070,86,
3071,86,o jewel! o valuable!
3072,86,that night the moon
3073,86,"dragged its blood bag, sick"
3074,86,animal
3075,86,"up over the harbor lights,"
3076,86,"and then grew normal,"
3077,86,"hard and apart and white,"
3078,86,"the scale-sheen on the sand scared me to death,"
3079,86,"we kept picking up handfuls, loving it,"
3080,86,"working it like dough, a mulatto body,"
3081,86,"the silk grits,"
3082,86,"a dog picked up your doggy husband, he went on,"
3083,86,
3084,86,"now i am silent, hate"
3085,86,"up to my neck,"
3086,86,"thick, thick,"
3087,86,"i do not speak,"

3089,86,"i am packing the babies,"
3090,86,"i am packing the sick cats,"
3091,86,"o vase of acid,"
3092,86,"it is love you are full of, you know who you hate,"
3093,86,he is hugging his ball and chain down by the gate
3094,86,that opens to the sea
3095,86,"where it drives in, white and black,"
3096,86,"then spews it back,"
3097,86,"every day you fill him with soul-stuff, like a pitcher,"
3098,86,"you are so exhausted,"
3099,86,"your voice my ear-ring,"
3100,86,"flapping and sucking, blood-loving bat,"
3101,86,"that is that, that is that,"
3102,86,"you peer from the door,"
3103,86,"sad hag, 'every woman’s a whore,"
3104,86,"i can’t communicate,'"
3105,86,
3106,86,i see your cute décor
3107,86,close on you like the fist of a baby
3108,86,"or an anemone, that sea"
3109,86,"sweetheart, that kleptomaniac,"
3110,86,"i am still raw,"
3111,86,"i say i may be back,"
3112,86,"you know what lies are for,"
3113,86,
3114,86,"even in your zen heaven we shan’t meet,"
3115,87,"love, the world"
3116,87,"suddenly turns, turns color, the streetlight"
3117,87,splits through the rat's tail
3118,87,"pods of the laburnum at nine in the morning,"
3119,87,"it is the arctic,"
3120,87,
3121,87,this little black
3122,87,"circle, with its tawn silk grasses - babies hair,"
3123,87,"there is a green in the air,"
3124,87,"soft, delectable,"
3125,87,"it cushions me lovingly,"
3126,87,
3127,87,"i am flushed and warm,"
3128,87,"i think i may be enormous,"
3129,87,"i am so stupidly happy,"
3130,87,my wellingtons
3131,87,"squelching and squelching through the beautiful red,"
3132,87,
3133,87,"this is my property,"
3134,87,two times a day
3135,87,"i pace it, sniffing"
3136,87,the barbarous holly with its viridian
3137,87,"scallops, pure iron,"
3138,87,
3139,87,"and the wall of the odd corpses,"
3140,87,"i love them,"
3141,87,"i love them like history,"
3142,87,"the apples are golden,"
3143,87,"imagine it , , ,"
3144,87,
3145,87,my seventy trees
3146,87,holding their gold-ruddy balls
3147,87,"in a thick gray death-soup,"
3148,87,their million
3149,87,"gold leaves metal and breathless,"
3150,87,
3151,87,"o love, o celibate,"
3152,87,nobody but me
3153,87,"walks the waist high wet,"
3154,87,the irreplaceable
3155,87,"golds bleed and deepen, the mouths of thermopylae,"
3156,88,that grandiose colossus who
3157,88,stood astride
3158,88,the envious assaults of sea
3159,88,"essaying, wave by wave,"
3160,88,"tide by tide,"
3161,88,"to undo him, perpetually,"
3162,88,"has nothing on you,"
3163,88,"o my love,"
3164,88,"o my great idiot, who"
3165,88,with one foot
3166,88,caught as it were in the muck-trap
3167,88,"of skin and bone,"
3168,88,dithers with the other way out
3169,88,in preposterous provinces of the madcap
3170,88,"cloud-cuckoo,"
3171,88,"agawp at the impeccable moon,"
3172,89,"the yew's black fingers wag,"
3173,89,"cold clouds go over,"
3174,89,so the deaf and dumb
3175,89,"signal the blind, and are ignored,"
3176,89,
3177,89,"i like black statements,"
3178,89,"the featurelessness of that cloud, now!"
3179,89,white as an eye all over!
3180,89,the eye of the blind pianist
3181,89,
3182,89,"at my table on the ship,"
3183,89,"he felt for his food,"
3184,89,"his fingers had the noses of weasels,"
3185,89,"i couldn't stop looking,"
3186,89,
3187,89,"he could hear beethoven,"
3188,89,"black yew, white cloud,"
3189,89,"the horrific complications,"
3190,89,"finger-traps--a tumult of keys,"
3191,89,
3192,89,"empty and silly as plates,"
3193,89,"so the blind smile,"
3194,89,"i envy big noises,"
3195,89,"the yew hedge of the grosse fuge,"
3196,89,"deafness is something else,"
3197,89,"such a dark funnel, my father!"
3198,89,i see your voice
3199,89,"black and leafy, as in my childhood,"
3200,89,
3201,89,"a yew hedge of orders,"
3202,89,"gothic and barbarous, pure german,"
3203,89,"dead men cry from it,"
3204,89,"i am guilty of nothing,"
3205,89,
3206,89,"the yew my christ, then,"
3207,89,is it not as tortured?
3208,89,"and you, during the great war"
3209,89,in the california delicatessen
3210,89,
3211,89,lopping off the sausages!
3212,89,"they colour my sleep,"
3213,89,"red, mottled, like cut necks,"
3214,89,there was a silence!
3215,89,
3216,89,"great silence of another order,"
3217,89,"i was seven, i knew nothing,"
3218,89,"the world occurred,"
3219,89,"you had one leg, and a prussian mind,"
3220,89,
3221,89,now similar clouds
3222,89,"are spreading their vacuous sheets,"
3223,89,do you say nothing?
3224,89,"i am lame in the memory,"
3225,89,
3226,89,"i remember a blue eye,"
3227,89,"a briefcase of tangerines,"
3228,89,"this was a man, then!"
3229,89,"death opened, like a black tree, blackly,"
3230,89,
3231,89,"i survive the while,"
3232,89,"arranging my morning,"
3233,89,"these are my fingers, this my baby,"
3234,89,"the clouds are a marriage of dress, of that pallor,"
3235,90,"it is no night to drown in,"
3236,90,"a full moon, river lapsing"
3237,90,"black beneath bland mirror-sheen,"
3238,90,
3239,90,the blue water-mists dropping
3240,90,scrim after scrim like fishnets
3241,90,"though fishermen are sleeping,"
3242,90,
3243,90,the massive castle turrets
3244,90,doubling themselves in a glass
3245,90,"all stillness, yet these shapes float"
3246,90,
3247,90,"up toward me, troubling the face"
3248,90,"of quiet, from the nadir"
3249,90,"they rise, their limbs ponderous"
3250,90,
3251,90,"with richness, hair heavier"
3252,90,"than sculptured marble, they sing"
3253,90,of a world more full and clear
3254,90,
3255,90,"than can be, sisters, your song"
3256,90,bears a burden too weighty
3257,90,for the whorled ear's listening
3258,90,
3259,90,"here, in a well-steered country,"
3260,90,"under a balanced ruler,"
3261,90,deranging by harmony
3262,90,
3263,90,"beyond the mundane order,"
3264,90,"your voices lay siege, you lodge"
3265,90,"on the pitched reefs of nightmare,"
3266,90,
3267,90,promising sure harborage;
3268,90,"by day, descant from borders"
3269,90,"of hebetude, from the ledge"
3270,90,
3271,90,"also of high windows, worse"
3272,90,even than your maddening
3273,90,"song, your silence, at the source"
3274,90,
3275,90,of your ice-hearted calling --
3276,90,"drunkenness of the great depths,"
3277,90,"o river, i see drifting"
3278,90,
3279,90,deep in your flux of silver
3280,90,"those great goddesses of peace,"
3281,90,"stone, stone, ferry me down there,"
3282,91,"'perspective betrays with its dichotomy,"
3283,91,"train tracks always meet, not here, but only"
3284,91,   in the impossible mind's eye;
3285,91,horizons beat a retreat as we embark
3286,91,on sophist seas to overtake that mark
3287,91,"   where wave pretends to drench real sky,'"
3288,91,
3289,91,"'well then, if we agree, it is not odd"
3290,91,that one man's devil is another's god
3291,91,   or that the solar spectrum is
3292,91,a multitude of shaded grays; suspense
3293,91,on the quicksands of ambivalence
3294,91,"   is our life's whole nemesis,"
3295,91,
3296,91,"so we could rave on, darling, you and i,"
3297,91,until the stars tick out a lullaby
3298,91,   about each cosmic pro and con;
3299,91,"nothing changes, for all the blazing of"
3300,91,"our drastic jargon, but clock hands that move"
3301,91,"   implacably from twelve to one,"
3302,91,
3303,91,we raise our arguments like sitting ducks
3304,91,to knock them down with logic or with luck
3305,91,   and contradict ourselves for fun;
3306,91,the waitress holds our coats and we put on
3307,91,the raw wind like a scarf; love is a faun
3308,91,"   who insists his playmates run,"
3309,91,
3310,91,"now you, my intellectual leprechaun,"
3311,91,would have me swallow the entire sun
3312,91,"   like an enormous oyster, down"
3313,91,"the ocean in one gulp, you say a mark"
3314,91,of comet hara-kiri through the dark
3315,91,"   should inflame the sleeping town,"
3316,91,
3317,91,"so kiss, the drunks upon the curb and dames"
3318,91,"in dubious doorways forget their monday names,"
3319,91,   caper with candles in their heads;
3320,91,"the leaves applaud, and santa claus flies in"
3321,91,"scattering candy from a zeppelin,"
3322,91,"   playing his prodigal charades,"
3323,91,
3324,91,the moon leans down to took; the tilting fish
3325,91,in the rare river wink and laugh; we lavish
3326,91,   blessings right and left and cry
3327,91,"hello, and then hello again in deaf"
3328,91,churchyard ears until the starlit stiff
3329,91,"   graves all carol in reply,"
3330,91,
3331,91,"now kiss again, till our strict father leans"
3332,91,to call for curtain on our thousand scenes;
3333,91,"   brazen actors mock at him,"
3334,91,multiply pink harlequins and sing
3335,91,in gay ventriloquy from wing to wing
3336,91,"   while footlights flare and houselights dim,"
3337,91,
3338,91,"tell now, we taunq where black or white begins"
3339,91,"and separate the flutes from violins,"
3340,91,   the algebra of absolutes
3341,91,explodes in a kaleidoscope of shapes
3342,91,"that jar, while each polemic jackanapes"
3343,91,"   joins his enemies' recruits,"
3344,91,
3345,91,"the paradox is that 'the play's the thing',"
3346,91,"though prima donna pouts and critic stings,"
3347,91,"   there burns throughout the line of words,"
3348,91,"the cultivated act, a fierce brief fusion"
3349,91,"which dreamers call real, and realists, illusion,"
3350,91,"   an insight like the flight of birds,"
3351,91,
3352,91,"arrows that lacerate the sky, while knowing"
3353,91,the secret of their ecstasy's in going;
3354,91,"   some day, moving, one will drop,"
3355,91,"and, dropping, die, to trace a wound that heals"
3356,91,"only to reopen as flesh congeals,"
3357,91,"   cycling phoenix never stops,"
3358,91,
3359,91,so we shall walk barefoot on walnut shells
3360,91,"of withered worlds, and stamp out puny hells"
3361,91,   and heavens till the spirits squeak
3362,91,"surrender, to build our bed as high as jack's"
3363,91,bold beanstalk; lie and love till sharp scythe hacks
3364,91,"   away our rationed days and weeks,"
3365,91,
3366,91,"then jet the blue tent topple, stars rain down,"
3367,91,and god or void appall us till we drown
3368,91,"   in our own tears, today we start"
3369,91,"to pay the piper with each breath, yet love"
3370,91,knows not of death nor calculus above
3371,91,"   the simple sum of heart plus heart,"
3372,92,"not easy to state the change you made,"
3373,92,"if i'm alive now, then i was dead,"
3374,92,"though, like a stone, unbothered by it,"
3375,92,"staying put according to habit,"
3376,92,"you didn't just tow me an inch, no-"
3377,92,nor leave me to set my small bald eye
3378,92,"skyward again, without hope, of course,"
3379,92,"of apprehending blueness, or stars,"
3380,92,
3381,92,"that wasn't it, i slept, say, a snake"
3382,92,masked among black rocks as a black rock
3383,92,in the white hiatus of winter-
3384,92,"like my neighbors, taking no pleasure"
3385,92,in the million perfectly-chisled
3386,92,cheeks alighting each moment to melt
3387,92,"my cheeks of basalt, they turned to tears,"
3388,92,"angels weeping over dull natures,"
3389,92,"but didn't convince me, those tears froze,"
3390,92,"each dead head had a visor of ice,"
3391,92,
3392,92,"and i slept on like a bent finger,"
3393,92,the first thing i was was sheer air
3394,92,and the locked drops rising in dew
3395,92,"limpid as spirits, many stones lay"
3396,92,"dense and expressionless round about,"
3397,92,"i didn't know what to make of it,"
3398,92,"i shone, mice-scaled, and unfolded"
3399,92,to pour myself out like a fluid
3400,92,"among bird feet and the stems of plants,"
3401,92,"i wasn't fooled, i knew you at once,"
3402,92,
3403,92,"tree and stone glittered, without shadows,"
3404,92,"my finger-length grew lucent as glass,"
3405,92,"i started to bud like a march twig,"
3406,92,"an arm and a leg, and arm, a leg,"
3407,92,"from stone to cloud, so i ascended,"
3408,92,now i resemble a sort of god
3409,92,floating through the air in my soul-shift
3410,92,"pure as a pane of ice, it's a gift,"
3411,93,no use whistling for lyonnesse!
3412,93,"sea-cold, sea-cold it certainly is,"
3413,93,"take a look at the white, high berg on his forehead-"
3414,93,
3415,93,"there's where it sunk,"
3416,93,"the blue, green,"
3417,93,"gray, indeterminate gilt"
3418,93,
3419,93,sea of his eyes washing over it
3420,93,and a round bubble
3421,93,popping upward from the mouths of bells
3422,93,
3423,93,"people and cows,"
3424,93,the lyonians had always thought
3425,93,"heaven would be something else,"
3426,93,
3427,93,"but with the same faces,"
3428,93,"the same places,"
3429,93,it was not a shock-
3430,93,
3431,93,"the clear, green, quite breathable atmosphere,"
3432,93,"cold grits underfoot,"
3433,93,"and the spidery water-dazzle on field and street,"
3434,93,
3435,93,"it never occurred that they had been forgot,"
3436,93,that the big god
3437,93,had lazily closed one eye and let them slip
3438,93,
3439,93,over the english cliff and under so much history!
3440,93,"they did not see him smile,"
3441,93,"turn, like an animal,"
3442,93,
3443,93,"in his cage of ether, his cage of stars,"
3444,93,he'd had so many wars!
3445,93,"the white gape of his mind was the real tabula rasa,"
3446,94,i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;
3447,94,"i lift my lids and all is born again,"
3448,94,"i think i made you up inside my head,"
3449,94,
3450,94,"the stars go waltzing out in blue and red,"
3451,94,"and arbitrary blackness gallops in,"
3452,94,"i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead,"
3453,94,
3454,94,i dreamed that you bewitched me into bed
3455,94,"and sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane,"
3456,94,"i think i made you up inside my head,"
3457,94,
3458,94,"god topples from the sky, hell's fires fade,"
3459,94,"exit seraphim and satan's men,"
3460,94,"i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead,"
3461,94,
3462,94,"i fancied you'd return the way you said,"
3463,94,"but i grow old and i forget your name,"
3464,94,"i think i made you up inside my head,"
3465,94,
3466,94,i should have loved a thunderbird instead;
3467,94,"at least when spring comes they roar back again,"
3468,94,"i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead,"
3469,94,"i think i made you up inside my head,"
3470,95,"once i was ordinary,"
3471,95,sat by my father's bean tree
3472,95,"eating the fingers of wisdom,"
3473,95,"the birds made milk,"
3474,95,"when it thundered i hid under a flat stone,"
3475,95,
3476,95,"the mother of mouths didn't love me,"
3477,95,"the old man shrank to a doll,"
3478,95,"o i am too big to go backward,"
3479,95,"birdmilk is feathers,"
3480,95,"the bean leaves are dumb as hands,"
3481,95,
3482,95,"this month is fit for little,"
3483,95,"the dead ripen in the grapeleaves,"
3484,95,"a red tongue is among us,"
3485,95,"mother, keep out of my barnyard,"
3486,95,"i am becoming another,"
3487,95,
3488,95,"dog-head, devourer,"
3489,95,"feed me the berries of dark,"
3490,95,"the lids won't shut, time"
3491,95,unwinds from the great umbilicus of the sun
3492,95,"its endless glitter,"
3493,95,
3494,95,"i must swallow it all,"
3495,95,
3496,95,"lady, who are these others in the moon's vat ---"
3497,95,"sleepdrunk, their limbs at odds?"
3498,95,"in this light the blood is black,"
3499,95,"tell me my name,"
3500,96,"the abstracts hover like dull angels,"
3501,96,nothing so vulgar as a nose or an eye
3502,96,"bossing the ethereal blanks of their face-ovals,"
3503,96,
3504,96,"their whiteness bears no relation to laundry,"
3505,96,"snow, chalk or suchlike, they're"
3506,96,"the real thing, all right, the good, the true , , ,"
3507,96,
3508,96,"salutary and pure as boiled water,"
3509,96,"loveless as the multiplication table,"
3510,96,"while the child smiles into thin air,"
3511,96,
3512,96,"six months in the world, and she is able"
3513,96,"to rock on all fours like a padded hammock,"
3514,96,"for her, the heavy notion of evil"
3515,96,
3516,96,"attending her cost less than a bellyache,"
3517,96,"and love the mother of milk, no theory,"
3518,96,"they mistake their star, these papery godfolk,"
3519,96,
3520,96,"they want the crib of some lamp-headed plato,"
3521,96,"let them astound his heart with their merit,"
3522,96,what girl ever flourished in such company?
3523,97,up here among the gull cries
3524,97,we stroll through a maze of pale
3525,97,"red-mottled relics, shells, claws"
3526,97,
3527,97,"as if it were summer still,"
3528,97,"that season has turned its back,"
3529,97,"through the green sea gardens stall,"
3530,97,
3531,97,"bow, and recover their look"
3532,97,of the imperishable
3533,97,gardens in an antique book
3534,97,
3535,97,"or tapestries on a wall,"
3536,97,"leaves behind us warp and lapse,"
3537,97,"the late month withers, as well,"
3538,97,
3539,97,below us a white gull keeps
3540,97,"the weed-slicked shelf for his own,"
3541,97,"hustles other gulls off, crabs"
3542,97,
3543,97,rove over his field of stone;

3717,104,"faces and darkness separate us over and over,"
3718,104,

3724,104,"i am important to her, she comes and goes,"
3725,104,"each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness,"
3726,104,"in me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman"
3727,104,"rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish,"
3728,105,no novice
3729,105,in those elaborate rituals
3730,105,which allay the malice
3731,105,"of knotted table and crooked chair,"
3732,105,the new woman in the ward

3734,105,among her secret combinations of eggshells

3736,105,footing sallow as a mouse
3737,105,between the cabbage-roses
3738,105,which are slowly opening their furred petals
3739,105,to devour and drag her down
3740,105,"into the carpet's design,"
3741,105,
3742,105,with bid-quick eyed cocked askew
3743,105,she can see in the nick of time
3744,105,how perilous needles grain the floorboards
3745,105,and outwit their brambled plan;
3746,105,"now through her ambushed air,"
3747,105,adazzle with bright shards
3748,105,"of broken glass,"
3749,105,"she edges with wary breath,"
3750,105,"fending off jag and tooth,"
3751,105,"until, turning sideways,"
3752,105,she lifts one webbed foot after the other
3753,105,"into the still, sultry weather"
3754,105,"of the patients' dining room,"
3755,106,better that every fiber crack

3757,106,blood drenching vivid
3758,106,"couch, carpet, floor"
3759,106,and the snake-figured almanac
3760,106,vouching you are
3761,106,"a million green counties from here,"
3762,106,
3763,106,"than to sit mute, twitching so"
3764,106,"under prickling stars,"
3765,106,"with stare, with curse"
3766,106,blackening the time
3767,106,"goodbyes were said, trains let go,"

3769,106,"my one kingdom,"
3770,107,"grub-white mulberries redden among leaves,"
3771,107,"i'll go out and sit in white like they do,"

3777,107,
3778,107,"a pigeon rudders down, it's fantail's white"

3780,107,"white petals, white fantails, ten white fingers,"

3782,107,enough for fingernails to make half-moons
3783,107,"redden in white palms no labor reddens,"
3784,107,"white bruises toward color, else collapses,"
3785,107,
3786,107,"berries redden, a body of whiteness"

3788,107,"though the body walk out in clean linen,"
3789,107,
3790,107,"i smell that whiteness here, beneath the stones"

3793,107,
3794,107,"death whitens in the egg and out of it,"

3797,107,
3798,107,"i tire, imagining white niagaras"
3799,107,"build up from a rock root, as fountains build"
3800,107,"against the weighty image of their fall,"
3801,107,
3802,107,"lucina, bony mother, laboring"
3803,107,"among the socketed white stars, your face"
3804,107,"of candor pares white flesh to the white bone,"
3805,107,
3806,107,"who drag our ancient father at the heel,"
3807,107,"white-bearded, weary, the berries purple"
3808,107,"and bleed, the white stomach may ripen yet,"
3809,108,"love set you going like a fat gold watch,"
3810,108,"the midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry"
3811,108,"took its place among the elements,"
3812,108,
3813,108,"our voices echo, magnifying your arrival,  new statue,"
3814,108,"in a drafty museum, your nakedness"
3815,108,"shadows our safety,  we stand round blankly as walls,"
3816,108,
3817,108,i'm no more your mother
3818,108,than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow
3819,108,"effacement at the wind's hand,"
3820,108,
3821,108,all night your moth-breath
3822,108,"flickers among the flat pink roses,  i wake to listen,"
3823,108,"a far sea moves in my ear,"
3824,108,
3825,108,"one cry, and i stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral"

3827,108,"your mouth opens clean as a cat's,  the window square"
3828,108,
3829,108,"whitens and swallows its dull stars,  and now you try"
3830,108,your handful of notes;
3831,108,"the clear vowels rise like balloons,"
3832,109,"overnight, very"
3833,109,"whitely, discreetly,"
3834,109,very quietly
3835,109,
3836,109,"our toes, our noses"
3837,109,"take hold on the loam,"
3838,109,"acquire the air,"
3839,109,
3840,109,"nobody sees us,"
3841,109,"stops us, betrays us;"
3842,109,"the small grains make room,"
3843,109,
3844,109,soft fists insist on
3845,109,"heaving the needles,"
3846,109,"the leafy bedding,"
3847,109,
3848,109,"even the paving,"
3849,109,"our hammers, our rams,"
3850,109,"earless and eyeless,"
3851,109,
3852,109,"perfectly voiceless,"

3856,109,"diet on water,"
3857,109,"on crumbs of shadow,"
3858,109,"bland-mannered, asking"
3859,109,
3860,109,"little or nothing,"
3861,109,so many of us!
3862,109,so many of us!
3863,109,
3864,109,"we are shelves, we are"
3865,109,"tables, we are meek,"
3866,109,"we are edible,"
3867,109,
3868,109,nudgers and shovers
3869,109,"in spite of ourselves,"
3870,109,"our kind multiplies,"
3871,109,
3872,109,we shall by morning
3873,109,"inherit the earth,"
3874,109,"our foot's in the door,"
3875,110,i came before the water ---
3876,110,colorists came to get the
3877,110,good of the cape light that scours
3878,110,sand grit to sided crystal
3879,110,and buffs and sleeks the blunt hulls
3880,110,of the three fishing smacks beached
3881,110,on the bank of the river's
3882,110,
3883,110,"backtracking tail, i'd come for"
3884,110,"free fish-bait, the blue mussels"
3885,110,clumped like bulbs at the grassroot
3886,110,"margin of the tidal pools,"
3887,110,"dawn tide stood dead low, i smelt"
3888,110,"mud stench, shell guts, gulls' leavings;"
3889,110,heard a queer crusty scrabble
3890,110,
3891,110,"cease, and i neared the silenced"
3892,110,"edge of a cratered pool-bed,"
3893,110,the mussels hung dull blue and
3894,110,"conspicuous, yet it seemed"
3895,110,a sly world's hinges had swung
3896,110,"shut against me, all held still,"
3897,110,"though i counted scant seconds,"
3898,110,
3899,110,enough ages lapsed to win
3900,110,confidence of safe-conduct
3901,110,in the wary other world
3902,110,"eyeing me, grass put forth claws,"
3903,110,"small mud knobs, nudged from under,"
3904,110,displaced their domes as tiny
3905,110,"knights might doff their casques, the crabs"
3906,110,
3907,110,inched from their pygmy burrows
3908,110,"and from the trench-dug mud, all camouflaged in mottled mail"
3909,110,"of browns and greens, each wore one"
3910,110,claw swollen to a shield large
3911,110,as itself--no fiddler's arm
3912,110,"grown gargantuan by trade,"
3913,110,
3914,110,"but grown grimly, and grimly"
3915,110,"borne, for a use beyond my"
3916,110,"guessing of it, sibilant"
3917,110,"mass-motived hordes, they sidled"
3918,110,out in a converging stream
3919,110,"toward the pool-mouth, perhaps to"
3920,110,meet the thin and sluggish thread
3921,110,
3922,110,of sea retracing its tide-
3923,110,"way up the river-basin,"
3924,110,"or to avoid me, they moved"
3925,110,obliquely with a dry-wet
3926,110,"sound, with a glittery wisp"
3927,110,"and trickle, could they feel mud"
3928,110,pleasurable under claws
3929,110,
3930,110,as i could between bare toes?
3931,110,that question ended it--i
3932,110,"stood shut out, for once, for all,"
3933,110,puzzling the passage of their
3934,110,absolutely alien
3935,110,order as i might puzzle
3936,110,at the clear tail of halley's
3937,110,
3938,110,comet coolly giving my
3939,110,"orbit the go-by, made known"
3940,110,by a family name it
3941,110,"knew nothing of, so the crabs"
3942,110,"went about their business, which"
3943,110,"wasn't fiddling, and i filled"
3944,110,a big handkerchief with blue
3945,110,
3946,110,"mussels, from what the crabs saw,"
3947,110,"if they could see, i was one"
3948,110,"two-legged mussel-picker,"
3949,110,high on the airy thatching
3950,110,of the dense grasses i found
3951,110,"the husk of a fiddler-crab,"
3952,110,"intact, strangely strayed above"
3953,110,
3954,110,his world of mud--green color
3955,110,and innards bleached out blown off
3956,110,somewhere by much sun and wind;
3957,110,there was no telling if he'd
3958,110,died recluse of suicide
3959,110,"or headstrong columbus crab,"
3960,110,"the crab-face, etched and set there,"
3961,110,
3962,110,"grimaced as skulls grimace, it"
3963,110,"had an oriental look,"
3964,110,a samurai death mask done
3965,110,"on a tiger tooth, less for"
3966,110,"art's sake than god's, far from sea ---"
3967,110,"where red-freckled crab-backs, claws"
3968,110,"and whole crabs, dead, their soggy"
3969,110,
3970,110,"bellies pallid and upturned,"
3971,110,perform their shambling waltzes
3972,110,on the waves' dissolving turn
3973,110,"and return, losing themselves"

4406,125,from the linked ponds that my eyes wince
4407,125,"and brim; the city melts like sugar,"
4408,125,a crocodile of small girls
4409,125,"knotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,"
4410,125,"opens to swallow me,  i'm a stone, a stick,"
4411,125,
4412,125,one child drops a barrette of pink plastic;
4413,125,"none of them seem to notice,"
4414,125,"their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off,"
4415,125,"now silence after silence offers itself,"
4416,125,"the wind stops my breath like a bandage,"
4417,125,
4418,125,"southward, over kentish town, an ashen smudge"
4419,125,"swaddles roof and tree,"
4420,125,"it could be a snowfield or a cloudbank,"
4421,125,"i suppose it's pointless to think of you at all,"
4422,125,"already your doll grip lets go,"
4423,125,
4424,125,"the tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow,"
4425,125,"you know me less constant,"
4426,125,"ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird,"
4427,125,"i circle the writhen trees,  i am too happy,"
4428,125,these faithful dark-boughed cypresses
4429,125,
4430,125,"brood, rooted in their heaped losses,"
4431,125,"your cry fades like the cry of a gnat,"
4432,125,"i lose sight of you on your blind journey,"
4433,125,while the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivulets
4434,125,"unspool and spend themselves,  my mind runs with them,"
4435,125,
4436,125,"pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem,"
4437,125,the day empties its images
4438,125,"like a cup or a room,  the moon's crook whitens,"
4439,125,"thin as the skin seaming a scar,"
4440,125,"now, on the nursery wall,"
4441,125,
4442,125,"the blue night plants, the little pale blue hill"
4443,125,"in your sister's birthday picture start to glow,"
4444,125,"the orange pompons, the egyptian papyrus"
4445,125,"light up,  each rabbit-eared"
4446,125,blue shrub behind the glass
4447,125,
4448,125,"exhales an indigo nimbus,"
4449,125,"a sort of cellophane balloon,"
4450,125,"the old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife,"
4451,125,gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;
4452,125,"i enter the lit house,"
4453,126,the triumph of wit over suffering
4454,126,
4455,126,head alone shows you in the prodigious act
4456,126,"of digesting what centuries alone digest,"
4457,126,"the mammoth, lumbering statuary of sorrow,"
4458,126,indissoluble enough to riddle the guts
4459,126,"of a whale with holes and holes, and bleed him white"
4460,126,"into salt seas,  hercules had a simple time,"
4461,126,"rinsing those stables,  a baby's tears would do it,"
4462,126,"but who'd volunteer to gulp the laocoon,"
4463,126,the dying gaul and those innumerable pietas
4464,126,"festering on the dim walls of europe's chapels,"
4465,126,"museums and sepulchers?  you,"
4466,126,                              you
4467,126,"who borrowed feathers for your feet, not lead,"
4468,126,"not nails, and a mirror to keep the snaky head"
4469,126,"in safe perspective, could outface the gorgon-grimace"
4470,126,"of human agony,  a look to numb"
4471,126,"limbs,  not a basilisk-blink, nor a double whammy,"
4472,126,"but all the accumulated last grunts, groans,"
4473,126,cries and heroic couplets concluding the million
4474,126,"enacted tragedies on these blood-soaked boards,"
4475,126,and every private twinge a hissing asp
4476,126,"to petrify your eyes, and every village"
4477,126,"catastrophe a writhing length of cobra,"
4478,126,and the decline of empires the thick coil of a vast
4479,126,"anacnoda,"
4480,126,"         imagine,  the world"
4481,126,"fisted to a foetus head, ravined, seamed"
4482,126,"with suffering from conception upwards, and there"
4483,126,"you have it in hand,  grit in the eye or a sore"
4484,126,"thumb can make anyone wince, but the whole globe"
4485,126,"expressive of grief turns gods, like kings, to rocks,"
4486,126,"those rocks, cleft and worn, themselves then grow"
4487,126,ponderous and extend despair on earth's
4488,126,"dark face,"
4489,126,          so might rigor mortis come to stiffen
4490,126,"all creation, were it not for a bigger belly"
4491,126,"still than swallows joy,"
4492,126,"                        you enter now,"
4493,126,"armed with feathers to tickle as well as fly,"
4494,126,and a fun-house mirror that turns the tragic muse
4495,126,"to the beheaded head of a sullen doll, one braid,"
4496,126,"a bedraggled snake, hanging limp as the absurd mouth"
4497,126,"hangs in its lugubious pout,  where are"
4498,126,the classic limbs of stubborn antigone?
4499,126,"the red, royal robes of phedre?  the tear-dazzled"
4500,126,sorrows of malfi's gentle duchess?
4501,126,                                  gone
4502,126,"in the deep convulsion gripping your face, muscles"
4503,126,"and sinews bunched, victorious, as the cosmic"
4504,126,"laugh does away with the unstitching, plaguey wounds"
4505,126,"of an eternal sufferer,"
4506,126,                        to you
4507,126,"perseus, the palm, and may you poise"
4508,126,"and repoise until time stop, the celestial balance"
4509,126,"which weighs our madness with our sanity,"
4510,127,"you said you would kill it this morning,"
4511,127,"do not kill it, it startles me still,"
4512,127,"the jut of that odd, dark head, pacing"
4513,127,
4514,127,"through the uncut grass on the elm's hill,"
4515,127,"it is something to own a pheasant,"
4516,127,"or just to be visited at all,"
4517,127,
4518,127,"i am not mystical, it isn't"
4519,127,"as if i thought it had a spirit,"
4520,127,"it is simply in its element,"
4521,127,
4522,127,"that gives it a kingliness, a right,"
4523,127,"the print of its big foot last winter,"
4524,127,"the trail-track, on the snow in our court"
4525,127,
4526,127,"the wonder of it, in that pallor,"
4527,127,"through crosshatch of sparrow and starling,"
4528,127,"is it its rareness, then? it is rare,"
4529,127,
4530,127,"but a dozen would be worth having,"
4531,127,"a hundred, on that hill-green and red,"
4532,127,"crossing and recrossing, a fine thing!"
4533,127,
4534,127,"it is such a good shape, so vivid,"
4535,127,"it's a little cornucopia,"
4536,127,"it unclaps, brown as a leaf, and loud,"
4537,127,
4538,127,"settles in the elm, and is easy,"
4539,127,"it was sunning in the narcissi,"
4540,127,"i trespass stupidly, let be, let be,"
4541,128,"the word, defining, muzzles; the drawn line"
4542,128,"ousts mistier peers and thrives, murderous,"
4543,128,in establishments which imagined lines
4544,128,
4545,128,"can only haunt,  sturdy as potatoes,"
4546,128,"stones, without conscience, word and line endure,"
4547,128,"given an inch,  not that they're gross although"
4548,128,
4549,128,afterthought often would have them alter
4550,128,"to delicacy, to poise but that they"
4551,128,"shortchange me continuously,  whether"
4552,128,
4553,128,"more or other, they still dissatisfy,"
4554,128,"unpoemed, unpictured, the potato"
4555,128,bunches its knobby browns on a vastly
4556,128,"superior page; the blunt stone also,"
4557,129,from water-tower hill to the brick prison
4558,129,"the shingle booms, bickering under"
4559,129,"the sea's collapse,"
4560,129,"snowcakes break and welter, this year"
4561,129,the gritted wave leaps
4562,129,the seawall and drops onto a bier
4563,129,"of quahog chips,"
4564,129,leaving a salty mash of ice to whiten
4565,129,
4566,129,"in my grandmother's sand yard, she is dead,"
4567,129,"whose laundry snapped and froze here, who"
4568,129,kept house against
4569,129,"what the sluttish, rutted sea could do,"
4570,129,squall waves once danced
4571,129,ship timbers in through the cellar window;
4572,129,"a thresh-tailed, lanced"
4573,129,shark littered in the geranium bed ---
4574,129,
4575,129,such collusion of mulish elements
4576,129,"she wore her broom straws to the nub,"
4577,129,twenty years out
4578,129,"of her hand, the house still hugs in each drab"
4579,129,stucco socket
4580,129,"the purple egg-stones, from great head's knob"
4581,129,to the filled-in gut
4582,129,"the sea in its cold gizzard ground those rounds,"
4583,129,
4584,129,nobody wintering now behind
4585,129,the planked-up windows where she set
4586,129,her wheat loaves
4587,129,"and apple cakes to cool, what is it"
4588,129,"survives, grieves"
4589,129,"so, battered, obstinate spit"
4590,129,of gravel? the waves'
4591,129,"spewed relics clicker masses in the wind,"
4592,129,
4593,129,"grey waves the stub-necked eiders ride,"
4594,129,"a labor of love, and that labor lost,"
4595,129,steadily the sea
4596,129,"eats at point shirley, she died blessed,"
4597,129,and i come by
4598,129,"bones, only bones, pawed and tossed,"
4599,129,"a dog-faced sea,"
4600,129,"the sun sinks under boston, bloody red,"
4601,129,
4602,129,i would get from these dry-papped stones
4603,129,"the milk your love instilled in them,"
4604,129,"the black ducks dive,"
4605,129,"and though your graciousness might stream,"
4606,129,"and i contrive,"
4607,129,"grandmother, stones are nothing of home"
4608,129,"to that spumiest dove,"
4609,129,"against both bar and tower the black sea runs,"
4610,130,"a dream tree, polly's tree,"
4611,130,"a thicket of sticks,"
4612,130,each speckled twig
4613,130,
4614,130,ending in a thin-paned
4615,130,leaf unlike any
4616,130,other on it
4617,130,
4618,130,or in a ghost flower
4619,130,flat as paper and
4620,130,of a color
4621,130,
4622,130,"vaporish as frost-breath,"
4623,130,more finical than
4624,130,any silk fan

4627,130,to stir robin's egg

4629,130,
4630,130,haired seed of the milkweed

4632,130,as the halo
4633,130,
4634,130,"rayed round a candle flame,"
4635,130,a will-o'-the-wisp
4636,130,"nimbus, or puff"
4637,130,
4638,130,"of cloud-stuff, tipping her"
4639,130,"queer candelabrum,"
4640,130,palely lit by
4641,130,
4642,130,"snuff-ruffed dandelions,"
4643,130,white daisy wheels and
4644,130,a tiger faced
4645,130,
4646,130,"pansy, it glows, o it's"
4647,130,"no family tree,"
4648,130,"polly's tree, nor"
4649,130,
4650,130,"a tree of heaven, though"
4651,130,"it marry quartz-flake,"
4652,130,"feather and rose,"
4653,130,
4654,130,it sprang from her pillow
4655,130,whole as a cobweb
4656,130,"ribbed like a hand,"
4657,130,
4658,130,"a dream tree, polly's tree"
4659,130,wears a valentine
4660,130,arc of tear-pearled
4661,130,
4662,130,bleeding hearts on its sleeve
4663,130,"and, crowning it, one"
4664,130,"blue larkspur star,"
4665,131,"little poppies, little hell flames,"
4666,131,do you do no harm?
4667,131,
4668,131,"you flicker,  i cannot touch you,"
4669,131,"i put my hands among the flames,  nothing burns"
4670,131,
4671,131,and it exhausts me to watch you
4672,131,"flickering like that, wrinkly and clear red, like the skin of a mouth,"
4673,131,
4674,131,"a mouth just bloodied,"
4675,131,little bloody skirts!
4676,131,
4677,131,"there are fumes i cannot touch,"
4678,131,"where are your opiates, your nauseous capsules?"
4679,131,
4680,131,"if i could bleed, or sleep! -"
4681,131,if my mouth could marry a hurt like that!
4682,131,
4683,131,"or your liquors seep to me, in this glass capsule,"
4684,131,"dulling and stilling,"
4685,131,

4689,132,whose red heart blooms through her coat so astoundingly --
4690,132,
4691,132,"a gift, a love gift"
4692,132,utterly unasked for
4693,132,by a sky
4694,132,
4695,132,palely and flamily
4696,132,"igniting its carbon monoxides, by eyes"
4697,132,"dulled to a halt under bowlers,"
4698,132,
4699,132,"o my god, what am i"
4700,132,that these late mouths should cry open
4701,132,"in a forest of frost, in a dawn of cornflowers,"
4702,133,"first frost, and i walk among the rose-fruit, the marble toes"

4704,133,off europe's relic heap
4705,133,"to sweeten your neck of the new york woods,"

4829,136,
4830,136,i shall unloose --
4831,136,from the small jeweled
4832,136,doll he guards like a heart --
4833,136,
4834,136,"the lioness,"
4835,136,"the shriek in the bath,"
4836,136,"the cloak of holes,"

4839,137,
4840,137,"there is a panther stalks me down,"
4841,137,one day i'll have my death of him;
4842,137,"his greed has set the woods aflame,"
4843,137,"he prowls more lordly than the sun,"
4844,137,"most soft, most suavely glides that step,"
4845,137,advancing always at my back;
4846,137,"from gaunt hemlock, rooks croak havoc,"
4847,137,"the hunt is on, and sprung the trap,"
4848,137,"flayed by thorns i trek the rocks,"
4849,137,"haggard through the hot white noon,"
4850,137,along red network of his veins
4851,137,"what fires run, what craving wakes?"
4852,137,
4853,137,"insatiate, he ransacks the land"
4854,137,"condemned by our ancestral fault,"
4855,137,"crying,  blood, let blood be spilt;"
4856,137,"meat must glut his mouth's raw wound,"
4857,137,keen the rending teeth and sweet
4858,137,the singeing fury of his fur;
4859,137,"his kisses parch, each paw's a briar,"
4860,137,"doom consummates that appetite,"
4861,137,"in the wake of this fierce cat,"
4862,137,"kindled like torches for his joy,"
4863,137,"charred and ravened women lie,"
4864,137,"become his starving body's bait,"
4865,137,
4866,137,"now hills hatch menace, spawning shade;"
4867,137,midnight cloaks the sultry grove;
4868,137,"the black marauder, hauled by love"
4869,137,"on fluent haunches, keeps my speed,"
4870,137,behind snarled thickets of my eyes
4871,137,lurks the lithe one; in dreams' ambush
4872,137,bright those claws that mar the flesh
4873,137,"and hungry, hungry, those taut thighs,"
4874,137,"his ardor snares me, lights the trees,"
4875,137,and i run flaring in my skin;
4876,137,"what lull, what cool can lap me in"
4877,137,when burns and brands that yellow gaze?
4878,137,
4879,137,"i hurl my heart to halt his pace,"
4880,137,to quench his thirst i squander blood;
4881,137,"he eats, and still his need seeks food,"
4882,137,"compels a total sacrifice,"
4883,137,"his voice waylays me, spells a trance,"
4884,137,the gutted forest falls to ash;
4885,137,"appalled by secret want, i rush"
4886,137,"from such assault of radiance,"
4887,137,"entering the tower of my fears,"
4888,137,"i shut my doors on that dark guilt,"
4889,137,"i bolt the door, each door i bolt,"
4890,137,"blood quickens, gonging in my ears,"
4891,137,
4892,137,"the panther's tread is on the stairs,"
4893,137,"coming up and up the stairs,"

4898,138,on my black pilgrimage
4899,138,this moon-pocked crystal ball
4900,138,will break before it help;
4901,138,rather than croak out
4902,138,"what's to come,"
4903,138,"my darling ravens are flown,"
4904,138,
4905,138,'forswear those freezing tricks of sight

4951,140,the barnyard like those taloned hags
4952,140,who ogle men
4953,140,
4954,140,"and crimp their wrinkles in a grin,"
4955,140,"jangling their great money bags,"

4977,141,
4978,141,"obdurate, in dense-grained wood,"
4979,141,a bald angel blocks and shapes
4980,141,the flimsy light; arms folded
4981,141,watches his cumbrous world eclipse
4982,141,
4983,141,"inane worlds of wind and cloud,"
4984,141,"bronze dead dominate the floor,"
4985,141,"resistive, ruddy-bodied,"

5002,142,o slow
5003,142,"horse the colour of rust,"
5004,142,
5005,142,"hooves, dolorous bells -"
5006,142,all morning the
5007,142,"morning has been blackening,"
5008,142,
5009,142,"a flower left out,"
5010,142,"my bones hold a stillness, the far"
5011,142,"fields melt my heart,"
5012,142,
5013,142,they threaten
5014,142,to let me through to a heaven
5015,142,"starless and fatherless, a dark water,"
5016,143,"out here there are no hearthstones,"
5017,143,"hot grains, simply,  it is dry, dry,"
5018,143,"and the air dangerous,  noonday acts queerly"
5019,143,on the mind's eye erecting a line
5020,143,"of poplars in the middle distance, the only"
5021,143,"object beside the mad, straight road"
5022,143,"one can remember men and houses by,"
5023,143,a cool wind should inhabit these leaves
5024,143,"and a dew collect on them, dearer than money,"
5025,143,"in the blue hour before sunup,"
5026,143,"yet they recede, untouchable as tomorrow,"
5027,143,or those glittery fictions of spilt water
5028,143,"that glide ahead of the very thirsty,"
5029,143,
5030,143,i think of the lizards airing their tongues
5031,143,in the crevice of an extremely small shadow
5032,143,"and the toad guarding his heart's droplet,"
5033,143,"the desert is white as a blind man's eye,"
5034,143,"comfortless as salt,  snake and bird"
5035,143,"doze behind the old maskss of fury,"
5036,143,"we swelter like firedogs in the wind,"
5037,143,"the sun puts its cinder out,  where we lie"
5038,143,the heat-cracked crickets congregate
5039,143,"in their black armorplate and cry,"
5040,143,"the day-moon lights up like a sorry mother,"
5041,143,and the crickets come creeping into our hair
5042,143,"to fiddle the short night away,"
5043,144,no map traces the street
5044,144,"where those two sleepers are,"
5045,144,"we have lost track of it,"
5046,144,they lie as if under water
5047,144,"in a blue, unchanging light,"
5048,144,the french window ajar
5049,144,
5050,144,"curtained with yellow lace,"
5051,144,through the narrow crack
5052,144,"odors of wet earth rise,"
5053,144,the snail leaves a silver track;
5054,144,"dark thickets hedge the house,"
5055,144,"we take a backward look,"
5056,144,
5057,144,among petals pale as death
5058,144,and leaves steadfast in shape
5059,144,"they sleep on, mouth to mouth,"
5060,144,"a white mist is going up,"
5061,144,"the small green nostrils breathe,"
5062,144,"and they turn in their sleep,"
5063,144,
5064,144,ousted from that warm bed
5065,144,"we are a dream they dream,"
5066,144,"their eyelids keep up the shade,"
5067,144,"no harm can come to them,"
5068,144,we cast our skins and slide
5069,144,"into another time,"
5070,145,"as the gods began one world, and man another,"
5071,145,so the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere
5072,145,"with moon-eye, mouth-pipe, he pipes, pipes green, pipes water,"
5073,145,
5074,145,pipes water green until green waters waver
5075,145,"with reedy lengths and necks and undulatings,"
5076,145,"and as his notes twine green, the green river"
5077,145,
5078,145,"shapes its images around his sons,"
5079,145,"he pipes a place to stand on, but no rocks,"
5080,145,"no floor, a wave of flickering grass tongues"
5081,145,
5082,145,"supports his foot, he pipes a world of snakes,"
5083,145,"of sways and coilings, from the snake-rooted bottom"
5084,145,"of his mind, and now nothing but snakes"
5085,145,"is visible, the snake-scales have become"
5086,145,"leaf, become eyelid; snake-bodies, bough, breast"
5087,145,"of tree and human, and he within this snakedom"
5088,145,
5089,145,rules the writhings which make manifest
5090,145,his snakehood and his might with pliant tunes
5091,145,"from his thin pipe, out of this green nest"
5092,145,
5093,145,as out of eden's navel twist the lines
5094,145,"of snaky generations, let there be snakes!"
5095,145,"and snakes there were, are, will be--till yawns"
5096,145,
5097,145,consume this pipe and he tires of music
5098,145,and pipes the world back to the simple fabric
5099,145,"of snake-warp, snake-weft, pipes the cloth of snakes"
5100,145,
5101,145,"to a melting of green waters, till no snake"
5102,145,"shows its head, and those green waters back to"
5103,145,"water, to green, to nothing like a snake,"
5104,145,"puts up his pipe, and lids his moony eye,"
5105,146,i?
5106,146,i walk alone;
5107,146,the midnight street
5108,146,spins itself from under my feet;
5109,146,when my eyes shut
5110,146,these dreaming houses all snuff out;
5111,146,through a whim of mine
5112,146,over gables the moon's celestial onion
5113,146,"hangs high,"
5114,146,
5115,146,i
5116,146,make houses shrink
5117,146,and trees diminish
5118,146,by going far; my look's leash
5119,146,dangles the puppet-people
5120,146,"who, unaware how they dwindle,"
5121,146,"laugh, kiss, get drunk,"
5122,146,nor guess that if i choose to blink
5123,146,"they die,"
5124,146,
5125,146,i
5126,146,"when in good humor,"
5127,146,give grass its green
5128,146,"blazon sky blue, and endow the sun"
5129,146,with gold;
5130,146,"yet, in my wintriest moods, i hold"
5131,146,absolute power
5132,146,to boycott any color and forbid any flower
5133,146,"to be,"
5134,146,
5135,146,i
5136,146,know you appear
5137,146,"vivid at my side,"
5138,146,"denying you sprang out of my head,"
5139,146,claiming you feel
5140,146,"love fiery enough to prove flesh real,"
5141,146,though it's quite clear
5142,146,"all you beauty, all your wit, is a gift, my dear,"
5143,146,"from me,"
5144,147,through fen and farmland walking
5145,147,with my own country love
5146,147,i saw slow flocked cows move
5147,147,white hulks on their day's cruising;
5148,147,"sweet grass sprang for their grazing,"
5149,147,
5150,147,"the air was bright for looking,"
5151,147,"most far in blue, aloft,"
5152,147,clouds steered a burnished drift;
5153,147,larks' nip and tuck arising
5154,147,"came in for my love's praising,"
5155,147,
5156,147,sheen of the noonsun striking
5157,147,took my heart as if
5158,147,it were a green-tipped leaf
5159,147,kindled by my love's pleasing
5160,147,"into an ardent blazing,"
5161,147,
5162,147,"and so, together, talking,"
5163,147,through sunday's honey-air
5164,147,we walked and still walk there---
5165,147,out of the sun's bruising
5166,147,"till the night mists came rising,"
5167,148,"all right, let's say you could take a skull and break it"
5168,148,the way you'd crack a clock; you'd crush the bone
5169,148,"between steel palms of inclination, take it,"
5170,148,"observing the wreck of metal and rare stone,"
5171,148,
5172,148,"this was a woman , her loves and stratagems"
5173,148,betrayed in mute geometry of broken
5174,148,"cogs and disks, inane mechanic whims,"
5175,148,"and idle coils of jargon yet unspoken,"
5176,148,
5177,148,not man nor demigod could put together
5178,148,"the scraps of rusted reverie, the wheels"
5179,148,"of notched tin platitudes concerning weather,"
5180,148,"perfume, politics, and fixed ideals,"
5181,148,
5182,148,the idiot bird leaps up and drunken leans
5183,148,"to chirp the hour in lunatic thirteens,"
5184,149,in darkroom of your eye the moonly mind
5185,149,someraults to couterfeit eclipse;
5186,149,bright angels black out over logic's land
5187,149,"under shutter of their handicaps,"
5188,149,
5189,149,commanding that corkscrew comet jet forth ink
5190,149,"to pitch the white world down in swiveling flood,"
5191,149,you overcast all order's noonday rank
5192,149,"and turn god's radiant photograph to shade,"
5193,149,
5194,149,steepling snake in that contrary light
5195,149,invades the dilate lens of genesis
5196,149,to print your flaming image in birthspot
5197,149,"with characters no cockcrow can deface,"
5198,149,
5199,149,"o maker of proud planet's negative,"

5201,150,"color of lemon, mango, peach,"
5202,150,these storybook villas
5203,150,still dream behind

5205,150,fine as hand-
5206,150,"made lace, or a leaf-and-flower pen-sketch,"

5208,150,"tilting with the winds,"
5209,150,"on arrowy stems,"
5210,150,"pineapple-barked,"
5211,150,a green crescent of palms
5212,150,sends up its forked
5213,150,"firework of fronds,"
5214,150,
5215,150,a quartz-clear dawn
5216,150,inch by bright inch
5217,150,"gilds all our avenue,"
5218,150,and out of the blue drench
5219,150,of angels' bay
5220,150,"rises the round red watermelon sun,"
5221,151,god knows how our neighbor managed to breed
5222,151,"his great sow,"
5223,151,"whatever his shrewd secret, he kept it hid"
5224,151,
5225,151,in the same way
5226,151,"he kept the sow--impounded from public stare,"
5227,151,"prize ribbon and pig show,"
5228,151,
5229,151,but one dusk our questions commended us to a tour
5230,151,through his lantern-lit

5232,151,
5233,151,"to gape at it,"
5234,151,this was no rose-and-larkspurred china suckling

5236,151,
5237,151,"for thrift children, nor dolt pig ripe for heckling,"
5238,151,about to be
5239,151,glorified for prime flesh and golden crackling
5240,151,
5241,151,in a parsley halo;
5242,151,"nor even one of the common barnyard sows,"
5243,151,"mire-smirched, blowzy,"

5250,151,shrilling her hulk
5251,151,"to halt for a swig at the pink teats, no, this vast"
5252,151,brobdingnag bulk
5253,151,
5254,151,of a sow lounged belly-bedded on that black
5255,151,"compost,"
5256,151,fat-rutted eyes
5257,151,"dream-filmed, what a vision of ancient hoghood"
5258,151,must
5259,151,
5260,151,thus wholly engross
5261,151,"the great grandam!--our marvel blazoned a knight,"
5262,151,"helmed, in cuirass,"
5263,151,
5264,151,unhorsed and shredded in the grove of combat
5265,151,by a grisly-bristled
5266,151,"boar, fabulous enough to straddle that sow's heat,"
5267,151,
5268,151,"but our farmer whistled,"
5269,151,"then, with a jocular fist thwacked the barrel nape,"
5270,151,and the green-copse-castled
5271,151,
5272,151,"pig hove, letting legend like dried mud drop,"
5273,151,"slowly, grunt"
5274,151,"on grunt, up in the flickering light to shape"
5275,151,
5276,151,a monument
5277,151,prodigious in gluttonies as that hog whose want
5278,151,made lean lent
5279,151,
5280,151,"of kitchen slops and, stomaching no constraint,"
5281,151,proceeded to swill
5282,151,the seven troughed seas and every earthquaking
5283,151,"continent,"
5284,152,now this particular girl
5285,152,during a ceremonious april walk
5286,152,with her latest suitor
5287,152,"found herself, of a sudden, intolerably struck"
5288,152,by the bird's irregular babel
5289,152,"and the leaves' litter,"
5290,152,
5291,152,"by this tumult afflicted, she"
5292,152,"observed her lover's gestures unbalance the air,"
5293,152,his gait stray uneven
5294,152,through a rank wilderness of fern and flower;
5295,152,"she judged petals in disarray,"
5296,152,"the whole season, sloven,"
5297,152,
5298,152,how she longed for winter then!-
5299,152,scrupulously austere in its order
5300,152,of white and black
5301,152,"ice and rock; each sentiment within border,"
5302,152,and heart's frosty discipline
5303,152,"exact as a snowflake,"
5304,152,
5305,152,but here - a burgeoning
5306,152,unruly enough to pitch her five queenly wits
5307,152,into vulgar motley-
5308,152,a treason not to be borne; let idiots
5309,152,reel giddy in bedlam spring;
5310,152,"she withdrew neatly,"
5311,152,
5312,152,and round her house she set
5313,152,such a barricade of barb and check
5314,152,against mutinous weather
5315,152,as no mere insurgent man could hope to break
5316,152,"with curse, fist, threat"
5317,152,"or love, either,"
5318,153,"these poems do not live, it's a sad diagnosis,"
5319,153,"they grew their toes and fingers well enough,"
5320,153,"their little foreheads bulged with concentration,"
5321,153,if they missed out on walking about like people
5322,153,"it wasn't for any lack of mother-love,"
5323,153,
5324,153,o i cannot explain what happened to them!
5325,153,"they are proper in shape and number and every part,"
5326,153,they sit so nicely in the pickling fluid!
5327,153,"they smile and smile and smile at me,"
5328,153,"and still the lungs won't fill and the heart won't start,"
5329,153,
5330,153,"they are not pigs, they are not even fish,"
5331,153,though they have a piggy and a fishy air --
5332,153,"it would be better if they were alive, and that's what they were,"
5333,153,"but they are dead, and their mother near dead with distraction,"
5334,153,"and they stupidly stare and do not speak of her,"
5335,154,"bare-handed, i hand the combs,"
5336,154,"the man in white smiles, bare-handed,"
5337,154,"our cheesecloth gauntlets neat and sweet,"
5338,154,"the throats of our wrists brave lilies,"
5339,154,he and i
5340,154,
5341,154,"have a thousand clean cells between us,"
5342,154,"eight combs of yellow cups,"
5343,154,"and the hive itself a teacup,"
5344,154,"white with pink flowers on it,"
5345,154,with excessive love i enameled it
5346,154,
5347,154,"thinking 'sweetness, sweetness,'"
5348,154,brood cells gray as the fossils of shells
5349,154,"terrify me, they seem so old,"
5350,154,"what am i buying, wormy mahogany?"
5351,154,is there any queen at all in it?
5352,154,
5353,154,"if there is, she is old,"
5354,154,"her wings torn shawls, her long body"
5355,154,rubbed of its plush ----
5356,154,"poor and bare and unqueenly and even shameful,"
5357,154,i stand in a column
5358,154,
5359,154,"of winged, unmiraculous women,"
5360,154,"honey-drudgers,"
5361,154,i am no drudge
5362,154,though for years i have eaten dust
5363,154,"and dried plates with my dense hair,"
5364,154,
5365,154,"and seen my strangeness evaporate,"
5366,154,"blue dew from dangerous skin,"
5367,154,"will they hate me,"
5368,154,"these women who only scurry,"
5369,154,"whose news is the open cherry, the open clover?"
5370,154,
5371,154,"it is almost over,"
5372,154,"i am in control,"
5373,154,"here is my honey-machine,"
5374,154,"it will work without thinking,"
5375,154,"opening, in spring, like an industrious virgin"
5376,154,
5377,154,to scour the creaming crests
5378,154,"as the moon, for its ivory powders, scours the sea,"
5379,154,"a third person is watching,"
5380,154,"he has nothing to do with the bee-seller or with me,"
5381,154,now he is gone
5382,154,
5383,154,"in eight great bounds, a great scapegoat,"
5384,154,"here is his slipper, here is another,"
5385,154,and here the square of white linen
5386,154,"he wore instead of a hat,"
5387,154,"he was sweet,"
5388,154,
5389,154,the sweat of his efforts a rain
5390,154,"tugging the world to fruit,"
5391,154,"the bees found him out,"
5392,154,"molding onto his lips like lies,"
5393,154,"complicating his features,"
5394,154,
5395,154,"they thought death was worth it, but i"
5396,154,"have a self to recover, a queen,"
5397,154,"is she dead, is she sleeping?"
5398,154,"where has she been,"
5399,154,"with her lion-red body, her wings of glass?"
5400,154,
5401,154,now she is flying
5402,154,"more terrible than she ever was, red"
5403,154,"scar in the sky, red comet"
5404,154,over the engine that killed her ----
5405,154,"the mausoleum, the wax house,"
5406,155,with white frost gone
5407,155,"and all green dreams not worth much,"
5408,155,after a lean day's work
5409,155,"time comes round for that foul slut,"
5410,155,mere bruit of her takes our street
5411,155,"until every man,"
5412,155,"red, pale or dark,"
5413,155,"veers to her slouch,"
5414,155,
5415,155,"mark, i cry, that mouth"
5416,155,"made to do violence on,"
5417,155,that seamed face
5418,155,"askew with blotch, dint, scar"
5419,155,"struck by each dour year,"
5420,155,walks there not some such one man
5421,155,as can spare breath
5422,155,to patch with brand of love this rank grimace
5423,155,"which out from black tarn, ditch and cup"
5424,155,into my most chaste own eyes
5425,155,"looks up,"
5426,156,behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled
5427,156,"on the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats,"
5428,156,"gas tanks, factory stacks- that landscape"
5429,156,of imperfections his bowels were part of-
5430,156,"rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught,"
5431,156,"sun struck the water like a damnation,"
5432,156,"no pit of shadow to crawl into,"
5433,156,and his blood beating the old tattoo
5434,156,"i am, i am, i am, children"
5435,156,were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift
5436,156,"raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave,"
5437,156,a mongrel working his legs to a gallop
5438,156,"hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit,"
5439,156,
5440,156,"he smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold,"
5441,156,"his body beached with the sea's garbage,"
5442,156,"a machine to breathe and beat forever,"
5443,156,flies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole
5444,156,"buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber,"
5445,156,"the words in his book wormed off the pages,"
5446,156,"everything glittered like blank paper,"
5447,156,
5448,156,everything shrank in the sun's corrosive
5449,156,"ray but egg rock on the blue wastage,"
5450,156,he heard when he walked into the water
5451,156,
5452,156,"the forgetful surf creaming on those ledges,"
5453,157,the photographic chamber of the eye
5454,157,"records bare painted walls, while an electric light"
5455,157,lays the chromium nerves of plumbing raw;
5456,157,such poverty assaults the ego; caught
5457,157,"naked in the merely actual room,"
5458,157,the stranger in the lavatory mirror
5459,157,"puts on a public grin, repeats our name"
5460,157,"but scrupulously reflects the usual terror,"
5461,157,
5462,157,just how guilty are we when the ceiling
5463,157,reveals no cracks that can be decoded? when washbowl
5464,157,maintains it has no more holy calling
5465,157,"than physical ablution, and the towel"
5466,157,dryly disclaims that fierce troll faces lurk
5467,157,"in its explicit folds? or when the window,"
5468,157,"blind with steam, will not admit the dark"
5469,157,which shrouds our prospects in ambiguous shadow?
5470,157,
5471,157,"twenty years ago, the familiar tub"
5472,157,bred an ample batch of omens; but now
5473,157,water faucets spawn no danger; each crab
5474,157,"and octopus -- scrabbling just beyond the view,"
5475,157,waiting for some accidental break
5476,157,"in ritual, to strike -- is definitely gone;"
5477,157,the authentic sea denies them and will pluck
5478,157,"fantastic flesh down to the honest bone,"
5479,157,
5480,157,we take the plunge; under water our limbs
5481,157,"waver, faintly green, shuddering away"
5482,157,from the genuine color of skin; can our dreams
5483,157,ever blur the intransigent lines which draw
5484,157,the shape that shuts us in? absolute fact
5485,157,intrudes even when the revolted eye
5486,157,is closed; the tub exists behind our back;
5487,157,"its glittering surfaces are blank and true,"
5488,157,
5489,157,yet always the ridiculous nude flanks urge
5490,157,the fabrication of some cloth to cover
5491,157,"such starkness; accuracy must not stalk at large,"
5492,157,"each day demands we create our whole world over,"
5493,157,disguising the constant horror in a coat
5494,157,of many-colored fictions; we mask our past
5495,157,"in the green of eden, pretend future's shining fruit"
5496,157,"can sprout from the navel of this present waste,"
5497,157,"in this particular tub, two knees jut up"
5498,157,"like icebergs, while minute brown hairs rise"
5499,157,on arms and legs in a fringe of kelp; green soap
5500,157,navigates the tidal slosh of seas
5501,157,breaking on legendary beaches; in faith
5502,157,we shall board our imagined ship and wildly sail
5503,157,among sacred islands of the mad till death
5504,157,"shatters the fabulous stars and makes us real,"
5505,158,"riding home from credulous blue domes,"
5506,158,the dreamer reins his waking appetite
5507,158,in panic at the crop of catacombs
5508,158,"sprung up like plague of toadstools overnight,"
5509,158,refectories where he reveled have become
5510,158,"the holstery of worms, rapacious blades"
5511,158,who weave within the skeleton's white womb
5512,158,"a caviare decay of rich brocades,"
5513,158,
5514,158,"turning the tables of this grave gourmet,"
5515,158,the fiendish butler saunters in and serves
5516,158,"for feast the sweetest meat of hell's chef d' uvres,"
5517,158,"his own pale bride upon a flaming tray,"
5518,158,"parsleyed with elegies, she lies in state"
5519,158,"waiting for his grace to consecrate,"
5520,159,o half moon---
5521,159,
5522,159,"half-brain, luminosity---"
5523,159,"negro, masked like a white,"
5524,159,
5525,159,your dark
5526,159,amputations crawl and appall---
5527,159,
5528,159,"spidery, unsafe,"
5529,159,what glove
5530,159,
5531,159,what leatheriness
5532,159,has protected
5533,159,
5534,159,me from that shadow---
5535,159,"the indelible buds,"
5536,159,
5537,159,"knuckles at shoulder-blades, the"
5538,159,faces that
5539,159,
5540,159,"shove into being, dragging"
5541,159,the lopped
5542,159,
5543,159,"blood-caul of absences,"
5544,159,all night i carpenter
5545,159,
5546,159,"a space for the thing i am given,"
5547,159,a love
5548,159,
5549,159,"of two wet eyes and a screech,"
5550,159,white spit
5551,159,
5552,159,of indifference!
5553,159,"the dark fruits revolve and fall,"
5554,159,
5555,159,"the glass cracks across,"
5556,159,the image
5557,159,
5558,159,"flees and aborts like dropped mercury,"
5559,160,"first, are you our sort of a person?"
5560,160,do you wear
5561,160,"a glass eye, false teeth or a crutch,"
5562,160,"a brace or a hook,"
5563,160,"rubber breasts or a rubber crotch,"
5564,160,
5565,160,"stitches to show something's missing? no, no? then"
5566,160,how can we give you a thing?
5567,160,"stop crying,"
5568,160,"open your hand,"
5569,160,"empty? empty, here is a hand"
5570,160,
5571,160,to fill it and willing
5572,160,to bring teacups and roll away headaches
5573,160,"and do whatever you tell it,"
5574,160,will you marry it?
5575,160,it is guaranteed
5576,160,
5577,160,to thumb shut your eyes at the end
5578,160,"and dissolve of sorrow,"
5579,160,"we make new stock from the salt,"
5580,160,"i notice you are stark naked,"
5581,160,how about this suit----
5582,160,
5583,160,"black and stiff, but not a bad fit,"
5584,160,will you marry it?
5585,160,"it is waterproof, shatterproof, proof"
5586,160,"against fire and bombs through the roof,"
5587,160,"believe me, they'll bury you in it,"
5588,160,
5589,160,"now your head, excuse me, is empty,"
5590,160,"i have the ticket for that,"
5591,160,"come here, sweetie, out of the closet,"
5592,160,"well, what do you think of that ?"
5593,160,naked as paper to start
5594,160,
5595,160,"but in twenty-five years she'll be silver,"
5596,160,"in fifty, gold,"
5597,160,"a living doll, everywhere you look,"
5598,160,"it can sew, it can cook,"
5599,160,"it can talk, talk , talk,"
5600,160,
5601,160,"it works, there is nothing wrong with it,"
5602,160,"you have a hole, it's a poultice,"
5603,160,"you have an eye, it's an image,"
5604,160,"my boy, it's your last resort,"
5605,160,"will you marry it, marry it, marry it,"
5606,161,"i ordered this, clean wood box"
5607,161,"square as a chair and almost too heavy to lift,"
5608,161,i would say it was the coffin of a midget
5609,161,or a square baby
5610,161,"were there not such a din in it,"
5611,161,
5612,161,"the box is locked, it is dangerous,"
5613,161,i have to live with it overnight
5614,161,"and i can't keep away from it,"
5615,161,"there are no windows, so i can't see what is in there,"
5616,161,"there is only a little grid, no exit,"
5617,161,
5618,161,"i put my eye to the grid,"
5619,161,"it is dark, dark,"
5620,161,with the swarmy feeling of african hands
5621,161,"minute and shrunk for export,"
5622,161,"black on black, angrily clambering,"
5623,161,
5624,161,how can i let them out?
5625,161,"it is the noise that appalls me most of all,"
5626,161,"the unintelligible syllables,"
5627,161,"it is like a roman mob,"
5628,161,"small, taken one by one, but my god, together!"
5629,161,
5630,161,"i lay my ear to furious latin,"
5631,161,"i am not a caesar,"
5632,161,"i have simply ordered a box of maniacs,"
5633,161,"they can be sent back,"
5634,161,"they can die, i need feed them nothing, i am the owner,"
5635,161,
5636,161,"i wonder how hungry they are,"
5637,161,i wonder if they would forget me
5638,161,"if i just undid the locks and stood back and turned into a tree,"
5639,161,"there is the laburnum, its blond colonnades,"
5640,161,"and the petticoats of the cherry,"
5641,161,
5642,161,they might ignore me immediately
5643,161,"in my moon suit and funeral veil,"
5644,161,i am no source of honey
5645,161,so why should they turn on me?
5646,161,"tomorrow i will be sweet god, i will set them free,"
5647,161,
5648,161,"the box is only temporary,"
5649,162,"it is ten years, now, since we rowed to children's island,"
5650,162,"the sun flamed straight down that noon on the water off marblehead,"
5651,162,"that summer we wore black glasses to hide our eyes,"
5652,162,"we were always crying, in our spare rooms, little put-upon sisters,"
5653,162,"in the two, huge, white, handsome houses in swampscott,"
5654,162,"when the sweetheart from england appeared, with her cream skin and yardley cosmetics,"
5655,162,"i had to sleep in the same room with the baby on a too-short cot,"
5656,162,and the seven-year-old wouldn't go out unless his jersey stripes
5657,162,"matched the stripes of his socks,"
5658,162,
5659,162,or it was richness! --- eleven rooms and a yacht
5660,162,with a polished mahogany stair to let into the water
5661,162,"and a cabin boy who could decorate cakes in six-colored frosting,"
5662,162,"but i didn't know how to cook, and babies depressed me,"
5663,162,"nights, i wrote in my diary spitefully, my fingers red"
5664,162,"with triangular scorch marks from ironing tiny ruchings and puffed sleeves,"
5665,162,when the sporty wife and her doctor husband went on one of their cruises
5666,162,"they left me a borrowed maid named ellen, for protection,"
5667,162,"and a small dalmation,"
5668,162,
5669,162,"in your house, the main house, you were better off,"
5670,162,you had a rose garden and a guest cottage and a model apothecary shop
5671,162,"and a cook and a maid, and knew about the key to the bourbon,"
5672,162,i remember you playing ja-da in a pink piqué dress
5673,162,"on the game-room piano, when the big people were out,"
5674,162,"and the maid smoked and shot pool under a green shaded lamp,"
5675,162,"the cook had one walleye and couldn't sleep, she was so nervous,"
5676,162,"on trial, from ireland, she burned batch after batch of cookies"
5677,162,"till she was fired,"
5678,162,
5679,162,"o what has come over us, my sister!"
5680,162,on that day-off the two of us cried so hard to get
5681,162,we lifted a sugared ham and a pineapple from the grownups' icebox
5682,162,"and rented an old green boat, i rowed, you read"
5683,162,"aloud, cross-legged on the stern seat, from the generation of vipers,"
5684,162,"so we bobbed out to the island, it was deserted ---"
5685,162,"a gallery of creaking porches and still interiors,"
5686,162,stopped and awful as a photograph of somebody laughing
5687,162,"but ten years dead,"
5688,162,
5689,162,"the bold gulls dove as if they owned it all,"
5690,162,"we picked up sticks of driftwood and beat them off,"
5691,162,"then stepped down the steep beach shelf and into the water,"
5692,162,"we kicked and talked, the thick salt kept us up,"
5693,162,"i see us floating there yet, inseparable--two cork dolls,"
5694,162,"what keyhole have we slipped through, what door has shut?"
5695,162,"the shadows of the grasses inched round like hands of a clock,"
5696,162,"and from our opposite continents we wave and call,"
5697,162,"everything has happened,"
5698,163,he was the bullman earlierm
5699,163,"king of the dish, my lucky animal,"
5700,163,"breathing was easy in his airy holding,"
5701,163,"the sun sat in his armpit,"
5702,163,"nothing went moldy, the little invisibles"
5703,163,"waited on him hand and foot,"
5704,163,"the blue sisters sent me to another school,"
5705,163,"monkey lived under the dunce cap,"
5706,163,"he kept blowing me kisses,"
5707,163,"i hardly knew him,"
5708,163,
5709,163,"he won't be got rid of,"
5710,163,"memblepaws, teary and sorry,"
5711,163,"fido littlesoul, the bowel's unfamiliar,"
5712,163,"a dustbin's enough for him,"
5713,163,"the dark's his bone,"
5714,163,"call him any name, he'll come to it,"
5715,163,
5716,163,"mud-sump, happy sty face,"
5717,163,"i've married a cupboard of rubbish,"
5718,163,"i bed in a fish puddle,"
5719,163,"down here the sky is always falling,"
5720,163,"hogwallow's at the window,"
5721,163,"the star bugs won't save me this mouth,"
5722,163,i housekeep in time's gut-end
5723,163,"among emmets and mollusks,"
5724,163,"duchess of nothing,"
5725,163,"hairtusk's bride,"
5726,164,who are these people at the bridge to meet me? they are the villagers----
5727,164,"the rector, the midwife, the sexton, the agent for bees,"
5728,164,"in my sleeveless summery dress i have no protection,"
5729,164,"and they are all gloved and covered, why did nobody tell me?"
5730,164,"they are smiling and taking out veils tacked to ancient hats,"
5731,164,
5732,164,"i am nude as a chicken neck, does nobody love me?"
5733,164,"yes, here is the secretary of bees with her white shop smock,"
5734,164,"buttoning the cuffs at my wrists and the slit from my neck to my knees,"
5735,164,"now i am milkweed silk, the bees will not notice,"
5736,164,"they will not smell my fear, my fear, my fear,"
5737,164,
5738,164,"which is the rector now, is it that man in black?"
5739,164,"which is the midwife, is that her blue coat?"
5740,164,"everybody is nodding a square black head, they are knights in visors,"
5741,164,"breastplates of cheesecloth knotted under the armpits,"
5742,164,"their smiles and their voces are changing, i am led through a beanfield,"
5743,164,
5744,164,"strips of tinfoil winking like people,"
5745,164,"feather dusters fanning their hands in a sea of bean flowers,"
5746,164,"creamy bean flowers with black eyes and leaves like bored hearts,"
5747,164,is it blood clots the tendrils are dragging up that string?
5748,164,"no, no, it is scarlet flowers that will one day be edible,"
5749,164,
5750,164,now they are giving me a fashionable white straw italian hat
5751,164,"and a black veil that molds to my face, they are making me one of them,"
5752,164,"they are leading me to the shorn grove, the circle of hives,"
5753,164,is it the hawthorn that smells so sick?
5754,164,"the barren body of hawthon, etherizing its children,"
5755,164,
5756,164,is it some operation that is taking place?
5757,164,"it is the surgeon my neighbors are waiting for,"
5758,164,"this apparition in a green helmet,"
5759,164,"shining gloves and white suit,"
5760,164,"is it the butcher, the grocer, the postman, someone i know?"
5761,164,
5762,164,"i cannot run, i am rooted, and the gorse hurts me"
5763,164,"with its yellow purses, its spiky armory,"
5764,164,"i could not run without having to run forever,"
5765,164,"the white hive is snug as a virgin,"
5766,164,"sealing off her brood cells, her honey, and quietly humming,"
5767,164,
5768,164,"smoke rolls and scarves in the grove,"
5769,164,"the mind of the hive thinks this is the end of everything,"
5770,164,"here they come, the outriders, on their hysterical elastics,"
5771,164,"if i stand very still, they will think i am cow-parsley,"
5772,164,"a gullible head untouched by their animosity,"
5773,164,
5774,164,"not even nodding, a personage in a hedgerow,"
5775,164,"the villagers open the chambers, they are hunting the queen,"
5776,164,"is she hiding, is she eating honey? she is very clever,"
5777,164,"she is old, old, old, she must live another year, and she knows it,"
5778,164,while in their fingerjoint cells the new virgins
5779,164,
5780,164,"dream of a duel they will win inevitably,"
5781,164,"a curtain of wax dividing them from the bride flight,"
5782,164,"the upflight of the murderess into a heaven that loves her,"
5783,164,"the villagers are moving the virgins, there will be no killing,"
5784,164,"the old queen does not show herself, is she so ungrateful?"
5785,164,
5786,164,"i am exhausted, i am exhausted ----"
5787,164,"pillar of white in a blackout of knives,"
5788,164,"i am the magician's girl who does not flinch,"
5789,164,"the villagers are untying their disguises, they are shaking hands,"
5790,164,"whose is that long white box in the grove, what have they accomplished, why am i cold,"
5791,165,"a garden of mouthings, purple, scarlet-speckled, black"
5792,165,"the great corollas dilate, peeling back their silks,"
5793,165,"their musk encroaches, circle after circle,"
5794,165,"a well of scents almost too dense to breathe in,"
5795,165,"hieratical in your frock coat, maestro of the bees,"
5796,165,"you move among the many-breasted hives,"
5797,165,
5798,165,"my heart under your foot, sister of a stone,"
5799,165,
5800,165,"trumpet-throats open to the beaks of birds,"
5801,165,"the golden rain tree drips its powders down,"
5802,165,in these little boudoirs streaked with orange and red
5803,165,"the anthers nod their heads, potent as kings"
5804,165,"to father dynasties, the air is rich,"
5805,165,here is a queenship no mother can contest ---
5806,165,
5807,165,"a fruit that's death to taste, dark flesh, dark parings,"
5808,165,
5809,165,"in burrows narrow as a finger, solitary bees"
5810,165,"keep house among the grasses, kneeling down"
5811,165,i set my eyes to a hole-mouth and meet an eye
5812,165,"round, green, disconsolate as a tear,"
5813,165,"father, bridegroom, in this easter egg"
5814,165,under the coronal of sugar roses
5815,165,
5816,165,"the queen bee marries the winter of your year,"
5817,166,"the black bull bellowed before the sea,"
5818,166,"the sea, till that day orderly,"
5819,166,"hove up against bendylaw,"
5820,166,
5821,166,the queen in the mulberry arbor stared
5822,166,"stiff as a queen on a playing card,"
5823,166,"the king fingered his beard,"
5824,166,
5825,166,"a blue sea, four horny bull-feet,"
5826,166,"a bull-snouted sea that wouldn't stay put,"
5827,166,"bucked at the garden gate,"
5828,166,
5829,166,along box-lined walks in the florid sun
5830,166,toward the rowdy bellow and back again
5831,166,"the lords and ladies ran,"
5832,166,
5833,166,"the great bronze gate began to crack,"
5834,166,"the sea broke in at every crack,"
5835,166,"pellmell, blueblack,"
5836,166,
5837,166,"the bull surged up, the bull surged down,"
5838,166,not to be stayed by a daisy chain
5839,166,"nor by any learned man,"
5840,166,
5841,166,"o the king's tidy acre is under the sea,"
5842,166,"and the royal rose in the bull's belly,"
5843,166,"and the bull on the king's highway,"
5844,167,"an old beast ended in this place,"
5845,167,
5846,167,"a monster of wood and rusty teeth,"
5847,167,fire smelted his eyes to lumps
5848,167,"of pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque"
5849,167,"as resin drops oozed from pine bark,"
5850,167,
5851,167,the rafters and struts of his body wear
5852,167,"their char of karakul still, i can't tell"
5853,167,how long his carcass had foundered under
5854,167,"the rubbish of summers, the black-leaved falls,"
5855,167,
5856,167,now little weeds insinuate
5857,167,"soft suede tongues between his bones,"
5858,167,"his armorplate, his toppled stones"
5859,167,"are an esplanade for crickets,"
5860,167,
5861,167,i pick and pry like a doctor or
5862,167,archæologist among
5863,167,"iron entrails, enameled bowl,"
5864,167,"the coils and pipes that made him run,"
5865,167,
5866,167,"the small dell eats what ate it once,"
5867,167,and yet the ichor of the spring
5868,167,proceeds clear as it ever did
5869,167,"from the broken throat, that marshy lip,"
5870,167,
5871,167,it flows off below the green and white
5872,167,"balustrade of a sag-backed bridge,"
5873,167,"leaning over, i encounter one"
5874,167,blue and improbable person
5875,167,
5876,167,"framed in a basketwork of cattails,"
5877,167,"o she is gracious and austere,"
5878,167,seated beneath the toneless water!
5879,167,"it is not i, it is not i,"
5880,167,
5881,167,"no animal spoils on her green doorstep,"
5882,167,and we shall never enter there
5883,167,"where the durable ones keep house,"
5884,167,the stream that hustles us
5885,167,
5886,167,"neither nourishes nor heals,"
5887,168,"i shall never get you put together entirely,"
5888,168,"pieced, glued, and properly jointed,"
5889,168,"mule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles"
5890,168,"proceed from your great lips,"
5891,168,"it's worse than a barnyard,"
5892,168,
5893,168,"perhaps you consider yourself an oracle,"
5894,168,"mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other,"
5895,168,thirty years now i have labored
5896,168,"to dredge the silt from your throat,"
5897,168,"i am none the wiser,"
5898,168,
5899,168,scaling little ladders with glue pots and pails of lysol
5900,168,i crawl like an ant in mourning
5901,168,over the weedy acres of your brow
5902,168,to mend the immense skull-plates and clear
5903,168,"the bald, white tumuli of your eyes,"
5904,168,
5905,168,a blue sky out of the oresteia
5906,168,"arches above us, o father, all by yourself"
5907,168,"you are pithy and historical as the roman forum,"
5908,168,"i open my lunch on a hill of black cypress,"
5909,168,your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered
5910,168,
5911,168,"in their old anarchy to the horizon-line,"
5912,168,it would take more than a lightning-stroke
5913,168,"to create such a ruin,"
5914,168,"nights, i squat in the cornucopia"
5915,168,"of your left ear, out of the wind,"
5916,168,
5917,168,"counting the red stars and those of plum-color,"
5918,168,"the sun rises under the pillar of your tongue,"
5919,168,"my hours are married to shadow,"
5920,168,no longer do i listen for the scrape of a keel
5921,168,"on the blank stones of the landing,"
5922,169,"the nose-end that twitches, the old imperfections---"
5923,169,tolerable now as moles on the face
5924,169,put up with until chagrin gives place
5925,169,to a wry complaisance---
5926,169,
5927,169,dug in first as god's spurs
5928,169,to start the spirit out of the mud
5929,169,"it stabled in; long-used, became well-loved"
5930,169,"bedfellows of the spirit's debauch, fond masters,"
5931,170,the word of a snail on the plate of a leaf?
5932,170,"it is not mine, do not accept it,"
5933,170,
5934,170,acetic acid in a sealed tin?
5935,170,"do not accept it, it is not genuine,"
5936,170,
5937,170,a ring of gold with the sun in it?
5938,170,"lies, lies and a grief,"
5939,170,
5940,170,"frost on a leaf, the immaculate"
5941,170,"cauldron, talking and crackling"
5942,170,
5943,170,all to itself on the top of each
5944,170,"of nine black alps,"
5945,170,
5946,170,"a disturbance in mirrors,"
5947,170,the sea shattering its grey one ----
5948,170,
5949,170,"love, love, my season,"
5950,171,"revolving in oval loops of solar speed,"
5951,171,"couched in cauls of clay as in holy robes,"
5952,171,"dead men render love and war no heed,"
5953,171,"lulled in the ample womb of the full-tilt globe,"
5954,171,
5955,171,no spiritual caesars are these dead;
5956,171,they want no proud paternal kingdom come;
5957,171,and when at last they blunder into bed
5958,171,"world-wrecked, they seek only oblivion,"
5959,171,
5960,171,"rolled round with goodly loam and cradled deep,"
5961,171,these bone shanks will not wake immaculate
5962,171,"to trumpet-toppling dawn of doomstruck day,"
5963,171,they loll forever in colossal sleep;
5964,171,"nor can god's stern, shocked angels cry them up"
5965,171,"from their fond, final, infamous decay,"
5966,172,"two virtues ride, by stallion, by nag,"
5967,172,"to grind our knives and scissors,"
5968,172,"lantern-jawed reason, squat common sense,"
5969,172,"one courting doctors of all sorts,"
5970,172,"one, housewives and shopkeepers,"
5971,172,
5972,172,"the trees are lopped, the poodles trim,"
5973,172,the laborer's nails pared level
5974,172,since those two civil servants set
5975,172,their whetstone to the blunted edge
5976,172,and minced the muddling devil
5977,172,
5978,172,whose owl-eyes in the scraggly wood
5979,172,"scared mothers to miscarry,"
5980,172,drove the dogs to cringe and whine
5981,172,"and turned the farmboy's temper wolfish,"
5982,172,"the housewife's, desultory,"
5983,173,"mother, mother, what ill-bred aunt"
5984,173,or what disfigured and unsightly
5985,173,cousin did you so unwisely keep
5986,173,"unasked to my christening, that she"
5987,173,sent these ladies in her stead
5988,173,with heads like darning-eggs to nod
5989,173,and nod and nod at foot and head
5990,173,and at the left side of my crib?
5991,173,
5992,173,"mother, who made to order stories"
5993,173,"of mixie blackshort the heroic bear,"
5994,173,"mother, whose witches always, always"
5995,173,"got baked into gingerbread, i wonder"
5996,173,"whether you saw them, whether you said"
5997,173,words to rid me of those three ladies
5998,173,"nodding by night around my bed,"
5999,173,"mouthless, eyeless, with stitched bald head,"
6000,173,
6001,173,"in the hurricane, when father's twelve"
6002,173,study windows bellied in
6003,173,"like bubbles about to break, you fed"
6004,173,my brother and me cookies and ovaltine
6005,173,"and helped the two of us to choir,"
6006,173,'thor is angry; boom boom boom!
6007,173,"thor is angry, we don't care!'"
6008,173,"but those ladies broke the panes,"
6009,173,"when on tiptoe the schoolgirls danced,"
6010,173,blinking flashlights like fireflies
6011,173,"and singing the glowworm song, i could"
6012,173,not lift a foot in the twinkle-dress
6013,173,"but, heavy-footed, stood aside"
6014,173,in the shadow cast by my dismal-headed
6015,173,"godmothers, and you cried and cried,"
6016,173,"and the shadow stretched, the lights went out,"
6017,173,
6018,173,"mother, you sent me to piano lessons"
6019,173,and praised my arabesques and trills
6020,173,although each teacher found my touch
6021,173,oddly wooden in spite of scales
6022,173,"and the hours of practicing, my ear"
6023,173,"tone-deaf and yes, unteachable,"
6024,173,"i learned, i learned, i learned elsewhere,"
6025,173,"from muses unhired by you, dear mother,"
6026,173,
6027,173,"i woke one day to see you, mother,"
6028,173,
6029,173,floating above me in bluest air
6030,173,on a green balloon bright with a million
6031,173,flowers and bluebirds that never were
6032,173,"never, never, found anywhere,"
6033,173,but the little planet bobbed away
6034,173,"like a soap-bubble as you called, come here!"
6035,173,"and i faced my traveling companions,"
6036,173,
6037,173,"day now, night now, at head, side, feet,"
6038,173,"they stand their vigil in gowns of stone,"
6039,173,"faces blank as the day i was born,"
6040,173,their shadows long in the setting sun
6041,173,"that never brightens or goes down,"
6042,173,"and this is the kingdom you bore me to,"
6043,173,"mother, mother, but no frown of mine"
6044,173,"will betray the company i keep,"
6045,174,thou shalt have an everlasting
6046,174,"monday and stand in the moon,"
6047,174,
6048,174,"the moon's man stands in his shell,"
6049,174,bent under a bundle
6050,174,"of sticks, the light falls chalk and cold"
6051,174,"upon our bedspread,"
6052,174,his teeth are chattering among the leprous
6053,174,"peaks and craters of those extinct volcanoes,"
6054,174,
6055,174,he also against black frost
6056,174,"would pick sticks, would not rest"
6057,174,until his own lit room outshone
6058,174,sunday's ghost of sun;
6059,174,"now works his hell of mondays in the moon's ball,"
6060,174,"fireless, seven chill seas chained to his ankle,"
6061,175,blameless as daylight i stood looking
6062,175,"at a field of horses, necks bent, manes blown,"
6063,175,tails streaming against the green
6064,175,"backdrop of sycamores, sun was striking"
6065,175,"white chapel pinnacles over the roofs,"
6066,175,"holding the horses, the clouds, the leaves"
6067,175,
6068,175,steadily rooted though they were all flowing
6069,175,away to the left like reeds in a sea
6070,175,"when the splinter flew in and stuck my eye,"
6071,175,"needling it dark, then i was seeing"
6072,175,"a melding of shapes in a hot rain,"
6073,175,"horses warped on the altering green,"
6074,175,
6075,175,"outlandish as double-humped camels or unicorns,"
6076,175,"grazing at the margins of a bad monochrome,"
6077,175,"beasts of oasis, a better time,"
6078,175,"abrading my lid, the small grain burns,"
6079,175,"red cinder around which i myself,"
6080,175,"horses, planets and spires revolve,"
6081,175,
6082,175,neither tears nor the easing flush
6083,175,"of eyebaths can unseat the speck,"
6084,175,"it sticks, and it has stuck a week,"
6085,175,"i wear the present itch for flesh,"
6086,175,"blind to what will be and what was,"
6087,175,"i dream that i am oedipus,"
6088,175,
6089,175,what i want back is what i was
6090,175,"before the bed, before the knife,"
6091,175,before the brooch-pin and the salve
6092,175,fixed me in this parenthesis;
6093,175,"horses fluent in the wind,"
6094,175,"a place, a time gone out of mind,"
6095,176,this man makes a pseudonym
6096,176,"and crawls behind it like a worm,"
6097,176,
6098,176,this woman on the telephone
6099,176,"says she is a man, not a woman,"
6100,176,
6101,176,"the mask increases, eats the worm,"
6102,176,"stripes for mouth and eyes and nose,"
6103,176,
6104,176,the voice of the woman hollows---
6105,176,"more and more like a dead one,"
6106,176,
6107,176,"worms in the glottal stops,"
6108,176,she hates
6109,176,
6110,176,the thought of a baby---
6111,176,"stealer of cells, stealer of beauty---"
6112,176,
6113,176,"she would rather be dead than fat,"
6114,176,"dead and perfect, like nefertit,"
6115,176,
6116,176,hearing the fierce mask magnify
6117,176,the silver limbo of each eye
6118,176,
6119,176,"where the child can never swim,"
6120,176,"where there is only him and him,"
6121,177,enter the chilly no-man's land of about
6122,177,"five o'clock in the morning, the no-color void"
6123,177,where the waking head rubbishes out the draggled lot
6124,177,of sulfurous dreamscapes and obscure lunar conundrums
6125,177,"which seemed, when dreamed, to mean so profoundly much,"
6126,177,
6127,177,gets ready to face the ready-made creation
6128,177,"of chairs and bureaus and sleep-twisted sheets,"
6129,177,"this is the kingdom of the fading apparition,"
6130,177,the oracular ghost who dwindles on pin-legs
6131,177,"to a knot of laundry, with a classic bunch of sheets"
6132,177,
6133,177,"upraised, as a hand, emblematic of farewell,"
6134,177,at this joint between two worlds and two entirely
6135,177,"incompatible modes of time, the raw material"
6136,177,of our meat-and-potato thoughts assumes the nimbus
6137,177,"of ambrosial revelation, and so departs,"
6138,177,
6139,177,chair and bureau are the hieroglyphs
6140,177,"of some godly utterance wakened heads ignore,"
6141,177,"so these posed sheets, before they thin to nothing,"
6142,177,"speak in sign language of a lost otherworld,"
6143,177,"a world we lose by merely waking up,"
6144,177,
6145,177,trailing its telltale tatters only at the outermost
6146,177,"fringe of mundane vision, this ghost goes"
6147,177,"hand aloft, goodbye, goodbye, not down"
6148,177,"into the rocky gizzard of the earth,"
6149,177,but toward a region where our thick atmosphere
6150,177,
6151,177,"diminishes, and god knows what is there,"
6152,177,a point of exclamation marks that sky
6153,177,"in ringing orange like a stellar carrot,"
6154,177,"its round period, displaced and green,"
6155,177,"suspends beside it the first point, the starting"
6156,177,
6157,177,"point of eden, next the new moon's curve,"
6158,177,"go, ghost of our mother and father, ghost of us,"
6159,177,"and ghost of our dreams' children, in those sheets"
6160,177,"which signify our origin and end,"
6161,177,to the cloud-cuckoo land of color wheels
6162,177,
6163,177,and pristine alphabets and cows that moo
6164,177,and moo as they jump over moons as new
6165,177,"as that crisp cusp toward which you voyage now,"
6166,177,"hail and farewell, hello, goodbye, o keeper"
6167,177,"of the profane grail, the dreaming skull,"
6168,178,"he, hunger-strung, hard to slake,"
6169,178,so fitted is for my black luck
6170,178,with heat such as no man could have
6171,178,and yet keep kind
6172,178,that all merit's in being meat
6173,178,seasoned how he'd most approve;
6174,178,blood's broth
6175,178,"filched by his hand,"
6176,178,"choice wassail makes, cooked hot,"
6177,178,cupped quick to mouth;
6178,178,"though prime parts cram each rich meal,"
6179,178,he'll not spare
6180,178,nor scant his want until
6181,178,"sacked larder's gone bone-bare,"
6182,179,"arena dust rusted by four bulls' blood to a dull redness,"
6183,179,"the afternoon at a bad end under the crowd's truculence,"
6184,179,"the ritual death each time botched among dropped capes, ill-judged"
6185,179,"stabs,"
6186,179,"the strongest will seemed a will towards ceremony, obese, dark-"
6187,179,"faced in his rich yellows, tassels, pompons, braid, the picador"
6188,179,
6189,179,rode out against the fifth bull to brace his pike and slowly bear
6190,179,"down deep into the bent bull-neck, cumbrous routine, not artwork,"
6191,179,instinct for art began with the bull's horn lofting in the mob's
6192,179,"hush a lumped man-shape, the whole act formal, fluent as a dance,"
6193,179,"blood faultlessly broached redeemed the sullied air, the earth's grossness,"
6194,180,we came over the moor-top
6195,180,"through air streaming and green-lit,"
6196,180,"stone farms foundering in it,"
6197,180,valleys of grass altering
6198,180,in a light neither dawn
6199,180,
6200,180,"nor nightfall, out hands, faces"
6201,180,"lucent as percelain, the earth's"
6202,180,"claim and weight gone out of them,"
6203,180,some such transfiguring moved
6204,180,the eight pilgrims towards its source--
6205,180,
6206,180,"toward the great jewel, shown often,"
6207,180,"never given; hidden, yet"
6208,180,simultaneously seen
6209,180,"on moor-top, at sea-bottom,"
6210,180,knowable only by light
6211,180,
6212,180,"other than noon, that moon, stars ---"
6213,180,the once-known way becoming
6214,180,"wholly other, and ourselves"
6215,180,"estranged, changed, suspended where"
6216,180,"angels are rumored, clearly"
6217,180,
6218,180,"floating , among the floating"
6219,180,"tables and chairs, gravity's"
6220,180,lost in the lift and drift of
6221,180,an easier element
6222,180,"than earth, and there is nothing"
6223,180,
6224,180,"so fine we cannot do it,"
6225,180,"but nearing means distancing,"
6226,180,at the common homecoming
6227,180,"light withdraws, chairs, tables drop"
6228,180,"down, the body weighs like stone,"
6229,181,"by the roots of my hair some god got hold of me,"
6230,181,"i sizzled in his blue volts like a desert prophet,"
6231,181,
6232,181,"the nights snapped out of sight like a lizard's eyelid ,"
6233,181,"a world of bald white days in a shadeless socket,"
6234,181,
6235,181,"a vulturous boredom pinned me in this tree,"
6236,181,"if he were i, he would do what i did,"
6237,182,"sky and sea, horizon-hinged"
6238,182,"tablets of blank blue, couldn't,"
6239,182,"clapped shut, flatten this man out,"
6240,182,
6241,182,"the great gods, stone-head, claw-foot"
6242,182,winded by much rock-bumping
6243,182,"and claw-threat, realized that,"
6244,182,
6245,182,"for what, then, had they endured"
6246,182,"dourly the long hots and colds,"
6247,182,"those old despots, if he sat"
6248,182,
6249,182,"laugh-shaken on his doorsill,"
6250,182,backbone unbendable as
6251,182,timbers of his upright hut?
6252,182,
6253,182,"hard gods were there, nothing else,"
6254,182,"still he thumbed out something else,"
6255,182,"thumbed no stony, horny pot,"
6256,182,
6257,182,"but a certain meaning green,"
6258,182,"he withstood them, that hermit,"
6259,182,"rock-face, crab-claw verged on green,"
6260,182,
6261,182,"gulls mulled in the greenest light,"
6262,183,"the fountains are dry and the roses over,"
6263,183,"incense of death, your day approaches,"
6264,183,"the pears fatten like little buddhas,"
6265,183,"a blue mist is dragging the lake,"
6266,183,
6267,183,"you move through the era of fishes,"
6268,183,the smug centuries of the pig-
6269,183,"head, toe and finger"
6270,183,"come clear of the shadow, history"
6271,183,
6272,183,"nourishes these broken flutings,"
6273,183,"these crowns of acanthus,"
6274,183,"and the crow settles her garments,"
6275,183,"you inherit white heather, a bee's wing,"
6276,183,
6277,183,"two suicides, the family wolves,"
6278,183,"hours of blankness, some hard stars"
6279,183,"already yellow the heavens,"
6280,183,the spider on its own string
6281,183,
6282,183,"crosses the lake, the worms"
6283,183,"quit their usual habitations,"
6284,183,"the small birds converge, converge"
6285,183,"with their gifts to a difficult borning,"
6286,184,"this is the light of the mind, cold and planetary,"
6287,184,"the trees of the mind are black, the light is blue,"
6288,184,"the grasses unload their griefs at my feet as if i were god,"
6289,184,"prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility,"
6290,184,fumy spiritious mists inhabit this place
6291,184,"separated from my house by a row of headstones,"
6292,184,"i simply cannot see where there is to get to,"
6293,184,
6294,184,"the moon is no door, it is a face in its own right,"
6295,184,"white as a knuckle and terribly upset,"
6296,184,it drags the sea after it like a dark crime; it is quiet
6297,184,"with the o-gape of complete despair, i live here,"
6298,184,"twice on sunday, the bells startle the sky -"
6299,184,"eight great tongues affirming the resurrection,"
6300,184,"at the end, they soberly bong out their names,"
6301,184,
6302,184,"the yew tree points up, it has a gothic shape,"
6303,184,"the eyes lift after it and find the moon,"
6304,184,"the moon is my mother, she is not sweet like mary,"
6305,184,"her blue garments unloose small bats and owls,"
6306,184,how i would like to believe in tenderness -
6307,184,"the face of the effigy, gentled by candles,"
6308,184,"bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes,"
6309,184,
6310,184,"i have fallen a long way, clouds are flowering"
6311,184,"blue and mystical over the face of the stars,"
6312,184,"inside the church, the saints will be all blue,"
6313,184,"floating on their delicate feet over cold pews,"
6314,184,"their hands and faces stiff with holiness,"
6315,184,"the moon sees nothing of this, she is bald and wild,"
6316,184,"and the message of the yew tree is blackness - blackness and silence,"
6317,185,"perfection is terrible, it cannot have children,"
6318,185,"cold as snow breath, it tamps the womb"
6319,185,
6320,185,"where the yew trees blow like hydras,"
6321,185,the tree of life and the tree of life
6322,185,
6323,185,"unloosing their moons, month after month, to no purpose,"
6324,185,"the blood flood is the flood of love,"
6325,185,
6326,185,"the absolute sacrifice,"
6327,185,"it means, no more idols but me,"
6328,185,
6329,185,"me and you,"
6330,185,"so, in their sulfur loveliness, in their smiles"
6331,185,
6332,185,these mannequins lean tonight
6333,185,"in munich, morgue between paris and rome,"
6334,185,
6335,185,"naked and bald in their furs,"
6336,185,"orange lollies on silver sticks,"
6337,185,
6338,185,"intolerable, without mind,"
6339,185,"the snow drops its pieces of darkness,"
6340,185,
6341,185,"nobody's about, in the hotels"
6342,185,hands will be opening doors and setting
6343,185,
6344,185,down shoes for a polish of carbon
6345,185,"into which broad toes will go tomorrow,"
6346,185,
6347,185,"o the domesticity of these windows,"
6348,185,"the baby lace, the green-leaved confectionery,"
6349,185,
6350,185,"the thick germans slumbering in their bottomless stolz,"
6351,185,and the black phones on hooks
6352,185,
6353,185,glittering
6354,185,glittering and digesting
6355,185,
6356,185,"voicelessness, the snow has no voice,"
6357,185,28 january 1963
6358,186,"a smile fell in the grass,"
6359,186,irretrievable!
6360,186,
6361,186,and how will your night dances
6362,186,"lose themselves, in mathematics?"
6363,186,
6364,186,such pure leaps and spirals ----
6365,186,surely they travel
6366,186,
6367,186,"the world forever, i shall not entirely"
6368,186,"sit emptied of beauties, the gift"
6369,186,
6370,186,"of your small breath, the drenched grass"
6371,186,"smell of your sleeps, lilies, lilies,"
6372,186,
6373,186,"their flesh bears no relation,"
6374,186,"cold folds of ego, the calla,"
6375,186,
6376,186,"and the tiger, embellishing itself ----"
6377,186,"spots, and a spread of hot petals,"
6378,186,
6379,186,the comets
6380,186,"have such a space to cross,"
6381,186,
6382,186,"such coldness, forgetfulness,"
6383,186,so your gestures flake off ----
6384,186,
6385,186,"warm and human, then their pink light"
6386,186,bleeding and peeling
6387,186,
6388,186,"through the black amnesias of heaven,"
6389,186,why am i given
6390,186,
6391,186,"these lamps, these planets"
6392,186,"falling like blessings, like flakes"
6393,186,
6394,186,"six sided, white"
6395,186,"on my eyes, my lips, my hair"
6396,186,
6397,186,"touching and melting,"
6398,186,"nowhere,"
6399,187,"you come in late, wiping your lips,"
6400,187,what did i leave untouched on the doorstep---
6401,187,
6402,187,"white nike,"
6403,187,streaming between my walls?
6404,187,
6405,187,"smilingly, blue lightning"

6419,187,
6420,187,"hooking itself to itself,"

6447,188,"cool as the pearled interior of a conch,"
6448,188,"bells, hooves, of the high-stipping black goats woke us,"
6449,188,around our bed the baronial furniture
6450,188,"foundered through levels of light seagreen and strange,"
6451,188,"not one leaf wrinkled in the clearing air,"
6452,188,"we dreamed how we were perfect, and we were,"
6453,188,
6454,188,"against bare, whitewashed walls, the furniture"
6455,188,"anchored itself, griffin-legged and darkly grained,"

6466,188,"shies from his touch, his is an iron mood,"
6467,188,"seeing her freeze, he turns his face away,"
6468,188,"they poise and grieve as in some old tragedy,"
6469,188,
6470,188,"moon-blanched and implacable, he and she"
6471,188,"would not be eased, released, our each example"
6472,188,of temderness dove through their purgatory
6473,188,"like a planet, a stone, swallowed in a great darkness,"
6474,188,"leaving no sparky track, setting up no ripple,"
6475,188,"nightly we left them in their desert place,"
6476,188,"lights out, they dogged us, sleepless and envious,"
6477,188,
6478,188,"we dreamed their arguments, their stricken voices,"
6479,188,"we might embrace, but those two never did,"
6480,188,"come, so unlike us, to a stiff impasse,"
6481,188,burdened in such a way we seemed the lighter-
6482,188,"ourselves the haunters, and they, flesh and blood;"
6483,188,"as if, above love's ruinage, we were"
6484,188,"the heaven those two dreamed of, in despair,"
6485,189,in ruck and quibble of courtfolk
6486,189,"this giant hulked, i tell you, on her scene"
6487,189,"with hands like derricks,"
6488,189,looks fierce and black as rooks;
6489,189,"why, all the windows broke when he stalked in,"
6490,189,
6491,189,her dainty acres he ramped through
6492,189,and used her gentle doves with manners rude;
6493,189,i do not know
6494,189,what fury urged him slay
6495,189,"her antelope who meant him naught but good,"
6496,189,
6497,189,she spoke most chiding in his ear
6498,189,till he some pity took upon her crying;
6499,189,of rich attire
6500,189,he made her shoulders bare
6501,189,"and solaced her, but quit her at cock's crowing,"
6502,189,
6503,189,a hundred heralds she sent out
6504,189,to summon in her slight all doughty men
6505,189,whose force might fit
6506,189,"shape of her sleep, her thought-"
6507,189,"none of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown,"
6508,189,
6509,189,so she is come to this rare pass
6510,189,whereby she treks in blood through sun and squall
6511,189,"and sings you thus ,"
6512,189,"'how sad, alas, it is"
6513,189,"to see my people shrunk so small, so small,'"
6514,190,"outlandish as a circus, the ravaged face"
6515,190,"parades the marketplace, lurid and stricken"
6516,190,"by some unutterable chagrin,"
6517,190,"maudlin from leaky eye to swollen nose,"
6518,190,"two pinlegs stagger underneath the mass,"
6519,190,"grievously purpled, mouth skewered on a groan,"
6520,190,"past keeping to the house, past all discretion ---"
6521,190,"myself, myself! --- obscene, lugubrious,"
6522,190,"better the flat leer of the idiot,"
6523,190,"the stone face of the man who dosen't feel,"
6524,190,"the velvet dodges of the hypocrite ,"
6525,190,"better, better, and more acceptable"
6526,190,"to timorous children, to the lady on the street,"
6527,190,"o oedipus, o christ, you use me ill,"
6528,191,"if the moon smiled, she would resemble you,"
6529,191,you leave the same impression
6530,191,"of something beautiful, but annihilating,"
6531,191,"both of you are great light borrowers,"
6532,191,"her o-mouth grieves at the world; yours is unaffected,"
6533,191,
6534,191,"and your first gift is making stone out of everything,"
6535,191,"i wake to a mausoleum; you are here,"
6536,191,"ticking your fingers on the marble table, looking for cigarettes,"
6537,191,"spiteful as a woman, but not so nervous,"
6538,191,"and dying to say something unanswerable,"
6539,191,
6540,191,"the moon, too, abuses her subjects,"
6541,191,"but in the daytime she is ridiculous,"
6542,191,"your dissatisfactions, on the other hand,"
6543,191,"arrive through the mailslot with loving regularity,"
6544,191,"white and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide,"
6545,191,
6546,191,"no day is safe from news of you,"
6547,191,"walking about in africa maybe, but thinking of me,"
6548,192,when night comes black
6549,192,such royal dreams beckon this man
6550,192,as lift him apart
6551,192,from his earth-wife's side
6552,192,"to wing, sleep-feathered,"
6553,192,"the singular air,"
6554,192,"while she, envious bride,"
6555,192,"cannot follow after, but lies"
6556,192,"with her blank brown eyes starved wide,"
6557,192,twisting curses in the tangled sheet
6558,192,"with taloned fingers,"
6559,192,shaking in her skull's cage
6560,192,the stuffed shape of her flown mate
6561,192,escaped among moon-plumaged strangers;
6562,192,"so hungered, she must wait in rage"
6563,192,until bird-racketing dawn
6564,192,when her shrike-face
6565,192,"leans to peck open those locked lids, to eat"
6566,192,"crowns, palace, all"
6567,192,"that nightlong stole her male,"
6568,192,and with red beak
6569,192,spike and suck out
6570,192,"last blood-drop of that truant heart,"
6571,193,no map traces the street
6572,193,"where those two sleepers are,"
6573,193,"we have lost track of it,"
6574,193,they lie as if under water
6575,193,"in a blue, unchanging light,"
6576,193,the french window ajar
6577,193,
6578,193,"curtained with yellow lace,"
6579,193,through the narrow crack
6580,193,"odors of wet earth rise,"
6581,193,the snail leaves a silver track;
6582,193,"dark thickets hedge the house,"
6583,193,"we take a backward look,"
6584,193,
6585,193,among petals pale as death
6586,193,and leaves steadfast in shape
6587,193,"they sleep on, mouth to mouth,"
6588,193,"a white mist is going up,"
6589,193,"the small green nostrils breathe,"
6590,193,"and they turn in their sleep,"
6591,193,
6592,193,ousted from that warm bed
6593,193,"we are a dream they dream,"
6594,193,"their eyelids keep up the shade,"
6595,193,"no harm can come to them,"
6596,193,we cast our skins and slide
6597,193,"into another time,"
6598,194,"this is the city where men are mended,"
6599,194,"i lie on a great anvil,"
6600,194,the flat blue sky-circle
6601,194,
6602,194,flew off like the hat of a doll
6603,194,"when i fell out of the light, i entered"
6604,194,"the stomach of indifference, the wordless cupboard,"
6605,194,
6606,194,"the mother of pestles diminished me,"
6607,194,"i became a still pebble,"
6608,194,"the stones of the belly were peaceable,"
6609,194,
6610,194,"the head-stone quiet, jostled by nothing,"
6611,194,"only the mouth-hole piped out,"
6612,194,importunate cricket
6613,194,
6614,194,"in a quarry of silences,"
6615,194,"the people of the city heard it,"
6616,194,"they hunted the stones, taciturn and separate,"
6617,194,
6618,194,"the mouth-hole crying their locations,"
6619,194,drunk as a foetus

6621,194,
6622,194,"the food tubes embrace me, sponges kiss my lichens away,"
6623,194,the jewelmaster drives his chisel to pry
6624,194,"open one stone eye,"
6625,194,
6626,194,"this is the after-hell, i see the light,"
6627,194,a wind unstoppers the chamber
6628,194,"of the ear, old worrier,"
6629,194,
6630,194,"water mollifies the flint lip,"
6631,194,"and daylight lays its sameness on the wall,"
6632,194,"the grafters are cheerful,"
6633,194,
6634,194,"heating the pincers, hoisting the delicate hammers,"
6635,194,a current agitates the wires
6636,194,"volt upon volt, catgut stitches my fissures,"
6637,194,
6638,194,"a workman walks by carrying a pink torso,"
6639,194,"the storerooms are full of hearts,"

6642,194,"my swaddled legs and arms smell sweet as rubber,"

6662,195,"the body under it is in my hands,"
6663,195,"as usual there is no face, a lump of chinese white"
6664,195,"with seven holes thumbed in, the soul is another light,"
6665,195,"i have not seen it; it does not fly up,"
6666,195,"tonight it has receded like a ship's light,"

6670,195,"a mat of roots, my assistants hook them back,"
6671,195,"stenches and colors assail me,"

6697,195,tomorrow they will swim
6698,195,"in vinegar like saints' relics,"
6699,195,"tomorrow the patient will have a clean, pink plastic limb,"

6731,196,"seventy feet up, in a black pine tree,"
6732,196,"it must be shot down, pom! pom!"
6733,196,"so dumb it thinks bullets are thunder,"
6734,196,
6735,196,it thinks they are the voice of god
6736,196,"condoning the beak, the claw, the grin of the dog"
6737,196,"yellow-haunched, a pack-dog,"
6738,196,grinning over its bone of ivory

6752,196,
6753,196,"leave and arrive, and there is no end to the country,"
6754,196,pom! pom! they fall

6785,197,"on a movie-screen,  they"
6786,197,"are unreal, we say,"
6787,197,
6788,197,"it was only in a movie, it was only"
6789,197,in a war making evil headlines when we
6790,197,
6791,197,were small that they famished and
6792,197,grew so lean and would not round
6793,197,
6794,197,out their stalky limbs again though peace
6795,197,plumped the bellies of the mice
6796,197,
6797,197,"under the meanest table,"
6798,197,it was during the long hunger-battle
6799,197,
6800,197,they found their talent to persevere
6801,197,"in thinness, to come, later,"
6802,197,
6803,197,"into our bad dreams, their menace"
6804,197,"not guns, not abuses,"
6805,197,
6806,197,"but a thin silence,"
6807,197,"wrapped in flea-ridded donkey skins,"

6809,197,"empty of complaint, forever"
6810,197,"drinking vinegar from tin cups, they wore"

6812,197,the insufferable nimbus of the lot-drawn
6813,197,"scapegoat,  but so thin,"
6814,197,
6815,197,"so weedy a race could not remain in dreams,"
6816,197,could not remain outlandish victims

6821,197,keep from cutting fat meat
6822,197,out of the side of the generous moon when it
6823,197,

6879,199,impaled upon a stern angelic stare
6880,199,you were condemned to serve the legal limit
6881,199,"and burn to death within your neon hell,"
6882,199,
6883,199,"now, disciplined in the strict ancestral chair,"
6884,199,"you sit, solemn-eyed, about to vomit,"
6885,199,"the future an electrode in your skull,"
6886,200,a poem for three voices
6887,200,
6888,200,"setting,  a maternity ward and round about"
6889,200,
6890,200,"first voice,"
6891,200,"i am slow as the world,  i am very patient,"
6892,200,"turning through my time, the suns and stars"
6893,200,"regarding me with attention,"
6894,200,"the moon's concern is more personal,"
6895,200,"she passes and repasses, luminous as a nurse,"
6896,200,"is she sorry for what will happen?  i do not think so,"
6897,200,"she is simply astonished at fertility,"
6898,200,
6899,200,"when i walk out, i am a great event,"
6900,200,"i do not have to think, or even rehearse,"
6901,200,"what happens in me will happen without attention,"
6902,200,the pheasant stands on the hill;
6903,200,"he is arranging his brown feathers,"
6904,200,"i cannot help smiling at what it is i know,"
6905,200,"leaves and petals attend me,  i am ready,"
6906,200,
6907,200,"second voice,"
6908,200,"when i first saw it, the small red seep, i did not believe it,"
6909,200,"i watched the men walk about me in the office,  they were so flat!"
6910,200,"there was something about them like cardboard, and now i had caught it,"
6911,200,"that flat, flat, flatness from which ideas, destructions,"
6912,200,"bulldozers, guillotines, white chambers of shrieks proceed,"
6913,200,"endlessly proceed--and the cold angels, the abstractions,"
6914,200,"i sat at my desk in my stockings, my high heels,"
6915,200,
6916,200,"and the man i work for laughed,  'have you seen something awful?"
6917,200,"you are so white, suddenly,'  and i said nothing,"
6918,200,"i saw death in the bare trees, a deprivation,"
6919,200,"i could not believe it,  is it so difficult"
6920,200,"for the spirit to conceive a face, a mouth?"
6921,200,"the letters proceed from these black keys, and these black keys proceed"
6922,200,"from my alphabetical fingers, ordering parts,"
6923,200,
6924,200,"parts, bits, cogs, the shining multiples,"
6925,200,"i am dying as i sit,  i lose a dimension,"
6926,200,"trains roar in my ears, departures, departures!"
6927,200,"the silver track of time empties into the distance,"
6928,200,"the white sky empties of its promise, like a cup,"
6929,200,"these are my feet, these mechanical echoes,"
6930,200,"tap, tap, tap, steel pegs,  i am found wanting,"
6931,200,
6932,200,"this is a disease i carry home, this is a death,"
6933,200,"again, this is a death,  is it the air,"
6934,200,the particles of destruction i suck up?  am i a pulse
6935,200,"that wanes and wanes, facing the cold angel?"
6936,200,"is this my lover then?  this death, this death?"
6937,200,"as a child i loved a lichen-bitten name,"
6938,200,"is this the one sin then, this old dead love of death?"
6939,200,
6940,200,"third voice,"
6941,200,"i remember the minute when i knew for sure,"
6942,200,"the willows were chilling,"
6943,200,"the face in the pool was beautiful, but not mine--"
6944,200,"it had a consequential look, like everything else,"
6945,200,"and all i could see was dangers,  doves and words,"
6946,200,"stars and showers of gold--conceptions, conceptions!"
6947,200,"i remember a white, cold wing"
6948,200,
6949,200,"and the great swan, with its terrible look,"
6950,200,"coming at me, like a castle, from the top of the river,"
6951,200,"there is a snake in swans,"
6952,200,"he glided by; his eye had a black meaning,"
6953,200,"i saw the world in it--small, mean and black,"
6954,200,"every little word hooked to every little word, and act to act,"
6955,200,"a hot blue day had budded into something,"
6956,200,
6957,200,"i wasn't ready,  the white clouds rearing"
6958,200,"aside were dragging me in four directions,"
6959,200,"i wasn't ready,"
6960,200,"i had no reverence,"
6961,200,i thought i could deny the consequence--
6962,200,"but it was too late for that,  it was too late, and the face"
6963,200,"went on shaping itself with love, as if i was ready,"
6964,200,
6965,200,"second voice,"
6966,200,"it is a world of snow now,  i am not at home,"
6967,200,"how white these sheets are,  the faces have no features,"
6968,200,"they are bald and impossible, like the faces of my children,"
6969,200,"those little sick ones that elude my arms,"
6970,200,"other children do not touch me,  they are terrible,"
6971,200,"they have too many colors, too much life,  they are not quiet,"
6972,200,"quiet, like the little emptinesses i carry,"
6973,200,
6974,200,"i have had my chances,  i have tried and tried,"
6975,200,"i have stitched life into me like a rare organ,"
6976,200,"and walked carefully, precariously, like something rare,"
6977,200,"i have tried not to think too hard,  i have tried to be natural,"
6978,200,"i have tried to be blind in love, like other women,"
6979,200,"blind in my bed, with my dear blind sweet one,"
6980,200,"not looking, through the thick dark, for the face of another,"
6981,200,
6982,200,"i did not look,  but still the face was there,"
6983,200,"the face of the unborn one that loved its perfections,"
6984,200,the face of the dead one that could only be perfect
6985,200,"in its easy peace, could only keep holy so,"
6986,200,"and then there were other faces,  the faces of nations,"
6987,200,"governments, parliaments, societies,"
6988,200,"the faceless faces of important men,"
6989,200,
6990,200,"it is these men i mind,"
6991,200,they are so jealous of anything that is not flat!  they are jealous gods
6992,200,"that would have the whole world flat because they are,"
6993,200,"i see the father conversing with the son,"
6994,200,"such flatness cannot but be holy,"
6995,200,"'let us make a heaven,' they say,"
6996,200,"'let us flatten and launder the grossness from these souls,'"
6997,200,
6998,200,"first voice,"
6999,200,"i am calm,  i am calm,  it is the calm before something awful,"
7000,200,"the yellow minute before the wind walks, when the leaves"
7001,200,"turn up their hands, their pallors,  it is so quiet here,"
7002,200,"the sheets, the faces, are white and stopped, like clocks,"
7003,200,"voices stand back and flatten,  their visible hieroglyphs"
7004,200,"flatten to parchment screens to keep the wind off,"
7005,200,"they paint such secrets in arabic, chinese!"
7006,200,
7007,200,"i am dumb and brown,  i am a seed about to break,"
7008,200,"the brownness is my dead self, and it is sullen,"
7009,200,"it does not wish to be more, or different,"
7010,200,"dusk hoods me in blue now, like a mary,"
7011,200,o color of distance and forgetfulness!--
7012,200,"when will it be, the second when time breaks"
7013,200,"and eternity engulfs it, and i drown utterly?"
7014,200,
7015,200,"i talk to myself, myself only, set apart--"
7016,200,"swabbed and lurid with disinfectants, sacrificial,"
7017,200,"waiting lies heavy on my lids,  it lies like sleep,"
7018,200,"like a big sea,  far off, far off, i feel the first wave tug"
7019,200,"its cargo of agony toward me, inescapable, tidal,"
7020,200,"and i, a shell, echoing on this white beach"
7021,200,"face the voices that overwhelm, the terrible element,"
7022,200,
7023,200,"third voice,"
7024,200,"i am a mountain now, among mountainy women,"
7025,200,the doctors move among us as if our bigness
7026,200,"frightened the mind,  they smile like fools,"
7027,200,"they are to blame for what i am, and they know it,"
7028,200,"they hug their flatness like a kind of health,"
7029,200,"and what if they found themselves surprised, as i did?"
7030,200,"they would go mad with it,"
7031,200,
7032,200,and what if two lives leaked between my thighs?
7033,200,"i have seen the white clean chamber with its instruments,"
7034,200,"it is a place of shrieks,  it is not happy,"
7035,200,"'this is where you will come when you are ready,'"
7036,200,"the night lights are flat red moons,  they are dull with blood,"
7037,200,"i am not ready for anything to happen,"
7038,200,"i should have murdered this, that murders me,"
7039,200,
7040,200,"first voice,"
7041,200,"there is no miracle more cruel than this,"
7042,200,"i am dragged by the horses, the iron hooves,"
7043,200,"i last,  i last it out,  i accomplish a work,"
7044,200,"dark tunnel, through which hurtle the visitations,"
7045,200,"the visitations, the manifestations, the startled faces,"
7046,200,"i am the center of an atrocity,"
7047,200,"what pains, what sorrows must i be mothering?"
7048,200,
7049,200,"can such innocence kill and kill?  it milks my life,"
7050,200,"the trees wither in the street,  the rain is corrosive,"
7051,200,"i taste it on my tongue, and the workable horrors,"
7052,200,"the horrors that stand and idle, the slighted godmothers"
7053,200,"with their hearts that tick and tick, with their satchels of instruments,"
7054,200,"i shall be a wall and a roof, protecting,"
7055,200,"i shall be a sky and a hill of good,  o let me be!"
7056,200,
7057,200,"a power is growing on me, an old tenacity,"
7058,200,"i am breaking apart like the world,  there is this blackness,"
7059,200,"this ram of blackness,  i fold my hands on a mountain,"
7060,200,"the air is thick,  it is thick with this working,"
7061,200,"i am used,  i am drummed into use,"
7062,200,"my eyes are squeezed by this blackness,"
7063,200,"i see nothing,"
7064,200,
7065,200,"second voice,"
7066,200,"i am accused,  i dream of massacres,"
7067,200,"i am a garden of black and red agonies,  i drink them,"
7068,200,"hating myself, hating and fearing,  and now the world conceives"
7069,200,"its end and runs toward it, arms held out in love,"
7070,200,"it is a love of death that sickens everything,"
7071,200,"a dead sun stains the newsprint,  it is red,"
7072,200,"i lose life after life,  the dark earth drinks them,"
7073,200,
7074,200,"she is the vampire of us all,  so she supports us,"
7075,200,"fattens us, is kind,  her mouth is red,"
7076,200,"i know her,  i know her intimately--"
7077,200,"old winter-face, old barren one, old time bomb,"
7078,200,"men have used her meanly,  she will eat them,"
7079,200,"eat them, eat them, eat them in the end,"
7080,200,"the sun is down,  i die,  i make a death,"
7081,200,
7082,200,"first voice,"
7083,200,"who is he, this blue, furious boy,"
7084,200,"shiny and strange, as if he had hurtled from a star?"
7085,200,he is looking so angrily!
7086,200,"he flew into the room, a shriek at his heel,"
7087,200,"the blue color pales,  he is human after all,"
7088,200,a red lotus opens in its bowl of blood;
7089,200,"they are stitching me up with silk, as if i were a material,"
7090,200,
7091,200,what did my fingers do before they held him?
7092,200,"what did my heart do, with its love?"
7093,200,"i have never seen a thing so clear,"
7094,200,his lids are like the lilac-flower
7095,200,"and soft as a moth, his breath,"
7096,200,"i shall not let go,"
7097,200,"there is no guile or warp in him,  may he keep so,"
7098,200,
7099,200,"second voice,"
7100,200,"there is the moon in the high window,  it is over,"
7101,200,how winter fills my soul!  and that chalk light
7102,200,"laying its scales on the windows, the windows of empty offices,"
7103,200,"empty schoolrooms, empty churches,  o so much emptiness!"
7104,200,"there is this cessation,  this terrible cessation of everything,"
7105,200,"these bodies mounded around me now, these polar sleepers--"
7106,200,"what blue, moony ray ices their dreams?"
7107,200,
7108,200,"i feel it enter me, cold, alien, like an instrument,"
7109,200,"and that mad, hard face at the end of it, that o-mouth"
7110,200,"open in its gape of perpetual grieving,"
7111,200,it is she that drags the blood-black sea around
7112,200,"month after month, with its voices of failure,"
7113,200,"i am helpless as the sea at the end of her string,"
7114,200,"i am restless,  restless and useless,  i, too, create corpses,"
7115,200,
7116,200,"i shall move north,  i shall move into a long blackness,"
7117,200,"i see myself as a shadow, neither man nor woman,"
7118,200,"neither a woman, happy to be like a man, nor a man"
7119,200,"blunt and flat enough to feel no lack,  i feel a lack,"
7120,200,"i hold my fingers up, ten white pickets,"
7121,200,"see, the darkness is leaking from the cracks,"
7122,200,"i cannot contain it,  i cannot contain my life,"
7123,200,
7124,200,"i shall be a heroine of the peripheral,"
7125,200,"i shall not be accused by isolate buttons,"
7126,200,"holes in the heels of socks, the white mute faces"
7127,200,"of unanswered letters, coffined in a letter case,"
7128,200,"i shall not be accused, i shall not be accused,"
7129,200,"the clock shall not find me wanting, nor these stars"
7130,200,"that rivet in place abyss after abyss,"
7131,200,
7132,200,"third voice,"
7133,200,"i see her in my sleep, my red, terrible girl,"
7134,200,"she is crying through the glass that separates us,"
7135,200,"she is crying, and she is furious,"
7136,200,"her cries are hooks that catch and grate like cats,"
7137,200,"it is by these hooks she climbs to my notice,"
7138,200,"she is crying at the dark, or at the stars"
7139,200,"that at such a distance from us shine and whirl,"
7140,200,
7141,200,"i think her little head is carved in wood,"
7142,200,"a red, hard wood, eyes shut and mouth wide open,"
7143,200,and from the open mouth issue sharp cries
7144,200,"scratching at my sleep like arrows,"
7145,200,"scratching at my sleep, and entering my side,"
7146,200,"my daughter has no teeth,  her mouth is wide,"
7147,200,"it utters such dark sounds it cannot be good,"
7148,200,
7149,200,"first voice,"
7150,200,what is it that flings these innocent souls at us?
7151,200,"look, they are so exhausted, they are all flat out"
7152,200,"in their canvas-sided cots, names tied to their wrists,"
7153,200,"the little silver trophies they've come so far for,"
7154,200,"there are some with thick black hair, there are some bald,"
7155,200,"their skin tints are pink or sallow, brown or red;"
7156,200,"they are beginning to remember their differences,"
7157,200,
7158,200,"i think they are made of water; they have no expression,"
7159,200,"their features are sleeping, like light on quiet water,"
7160,200,"they are the real monks and nuns in their identical garments,"
7161,200,i see them showering like stars on to the world--
7162,200,"on india, africa, america, these miraculous ones,"
7163,200,"these pure, small images,  they smell of milk,"
7164,200,"their footsoles are untouched,  they are walkers of air,"
7165,200,
7166,200,can nothingness be so prodigal?
7167,200,"here is my son,"
7168,200,"his wide eye is that general, flat blue,"
7169,200,"he is turning to me like a little, blind, bright plant,"
7170,200,"one cry,  it is the hook i hang on,"
7171,200,"and i am a river of milk,"
7172,200,"i am a warm hill,"
7173,200,
7174,200,"second voice,"
7175,200,"i am not ugly,  i am even beautiful,"
7176,200,"the mirror gives back a woman without deformity,"
7177,200,"the nurses give back my clothes, and an identity,"
7178,200,"it is usual, they say, for such a thing to happen,"
7179,200,"it is usual in my life, and the lives of others,"
7180,200,"i am one in five, something like that,  i am not hopeless,"
7181,200,"i am beautiful as a statistic,  here is my lipstick,"
7182,200,
7183,200,"i draw on the old mouth,"
7184,200,the red mouth i put by with my identity
7185,200,"a day ago, two days, three days ago,  it was a friday,"
7186,200,"i do not even need a holiday; i can go to work today,"
7187,200,"i can love my husband, who will understand,"
7188,200,who will love me through the blur of my deformity
7189,200,"as if i had lost an eye, a leg, a tongue,"
7190,200,
7191,200,"and so i stand, a little sightless,  so i walk"
7192,200,"away on wheels, instead of legs, they serve as well,"
7193,200,"and learn to speak with fingers, not a tongue,"
7194,200,"the body is resourceful,"
7195,200,the body of a starfish can grow back its arms
7196,200,"and newts are prodigal in legs,  and may i be"
7197,200,"as prodigal in what lacks me,"
7198,200,
7199,200,"third voice,"
7200,200,"she is a small island, asleep and peaceful,"
7201,200,"and i am a white ship hooting,  goodbye, goodbye,"
7202,200,"the day is blazing,  it is very mournful,"
7203,200,"the flowers in this room are red and tropical,"
7204,200,"they have lived behind glass all their lives, they have been cared for"
7205,200,"       tenderly,"
7206,200,"now they face a winter of white sheets, white faces,"

7208,200,
7209,200,"there are the clothes of a fat woman i do not know,"
7210,200,"there is my comb and brush,  there is an emptiness,"
7211,200,"i am so vulnerable suddenly,"
7212,200,"i am a wound walking out of hospital,"
7213,200,"i am a wound that they are letting go,"
7214,200,"i leave my health behind,  i leave someone"

7219,200,"i am bled white as wax, i have no attachments,"
7220,200,"i am flat and virginal, which means nothing has happened,"
7221,200,"nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and scrapped, begun again,"

7225,200,
7226,200,"so neat she is transparent, like a spirit,"
7227,200,how shyly she superimposes her neat self
7228,200,"on the inferno of african oranges, the heel-hung pigs,"
7229,200,"she is deferring to reality,"
7230,200,"it is i,  it is i--"

7234,200,"first voice,"
7235,200,"how long can i be a wall, keeping the wind off?"
7236,200,how long can i be

7243,200,how long can i be a wall around my green property?
7244,200,how long can my hands
7245,200,"be a bandage to his hurt, and my words"
7246,200,"bright birds in the sky, consoling, consoling?"
7247,200,it is a terrible thing
7248,200,"to be so open,  it is as if my heart"
7249,200,"put on a face and walked into the world,"
7250,200,
7251,200,"third voice,"
7252,200,"today the colleges are drunk with spring,"
7253,200,"my black gown is a little funeral,"
7254,200,"it shows i am serious,"
7255,200,"the books i carry wedge into my side,"
7256,200,"i had an old wound once, but it is healing,"
7257,200,"i had a dream of an island, red with cries,"
7258,200,"it was a dream, and did not mean a thing,"
7259,200,
7260,200,"first voice,"
7261,200,"dawn flowers in the great elm outside the house,"
7262,200,"the swifts are back,  they are shrieking like paper rockets,"
7263,200,i hear the sound of the hours
7264,200,"widen and die in the hedgerows,  i hear the moo of cows,"
7265,200,"the colors replenish themselves, and the wet"
7266,200,"thatch smokes in the sun,"
7267,200,"the narcissi open white faces in the orchard,"
7268,200,
7269,200,"i am reassured,  i am reassured,"
7270,200,"these are the clear bright colors of the nursery,"
7271,200,"the talking ducks, the happy lambs,"
7272,200,"i am simple again,  i believe in miracles,"
7273,200,i do not believe in those terrible children
7274,200,"who injure my sleep with their white eyes, their fingerless hands,"
7275,200,"they are not mine,  they do not belong to me,"
7276,200,
7277,200,"i shall meditate upon normality,"
7278,200,"i shall meditate upon my little son,"
7279,200,"he does not walk,  he does not speak a word,"
7280,200,"he is still swaddled in white bands,"
7281,200,"but he is pink and perfect,  he smiles so frequently,"
7282,200,"i have papered his room with big roses,"
7283,200,"i have painted little hearts on everything,"
7284,200,
7285,200,"i do not will him to be exceptional,"
7286,200,"it is the exception that interests the devil,"
7287,200,it is the exception that climbs the sorrowful hill
7288,200,"or sits in the desert and hurts his mother's heart,"
7289,200,"i will him to be common,"
7290,200,"to love me as i love him,"
7291,200,"and to marry what he wants and where he will,"
7292,200,
7293,200,"third voice,"
7294,200,"hot noon in the meadows,  the buttercups"
7295,200,"swelter and melt, and the lovers"
7296,200,"pass by, pass by,"
7297,200,"they are black and flat as shadows,"
7298,200,it is so beautiful to have no attachments!
7299,200,"i am solitary as grass,  what is it i miss?"
7300,200,"shall i ever find it, whatever it is?"
7301,200,
7302,200,"the swans are gone,  still the river"
7303,200,"remembers how white they were,"
7304,200,"it strives after them with its lights,"
7305,200,"it finds their shapes in a cloud,"
7306,200,what is that bird that cries
7307,200,with such sorrow in its voice?
7308,200,"i am young as ever, it says,  what is it i miss?"
7309,200,
7310,200,"second voice,"
7311,200,"i am at home in the lamplight,  the evenings are lengthening,"
7312,200,"i am mending a silk slip,  my husband is reading,"
7313,200,"how beautifully the light includes these things,"
7314,200,"there is a kind of smoke in the spring air,"
7315,200,"a smoke that takes the parks, the little statues"
7316,200,"with pinkness, as if a tenderness awoke,"
7317,200,"a tenderness that did not tire, something healing,"
7318,200,
7319,200,"i wait and ache,  i think i have been healing,"
7320,200,"there is a great deal else to do,  my hands"
7321,200,"can stitch lace neatly on to this material,  my husband"
7322,200,"can turn and turn the pages of a book,"
7323,200,"and so we are at home together, after hours,"
7324,200,"it is only time that weighs upon our hands,"
7325,200,"it is only time, and that is not material,"
7326,200,
7327,200,"the streets may turn to paper suddenly, but i recover"
7328,200,"from the long fall, and find myself in bed,"
7329,200,"safe on the mattress, hands braced, as for a fall,"
7330,200,"i find myself again,  i am no shadow"
7331,200,"though there is a shadow starting from my feet,  i am a wife,"
7332,200,"the city waits and aches,  the little grasses"
7333,200,"crack through stone, and they are green with life,"
7334,201,cold on my narrow cot i lie
7335,201,and in sorrow look
7336,201,"through my window-square of black,"
7337,201,
7338,201,"figured in the midnight sky,"
7339,201,a mosaic of stars
7340,201,"diagrams the falling years,"
7341,201,
7342,201,"while from the moon, my lover's eye"
7343,201,chills me to death
7344,201,"with radiance of his frozen faith,"
7345,201,
7346,201,once i wounded him with so
7347,201,small a thorn
7348,201,i never thought his flesh would burn
7349,201,
7350,201,or that the heat within would grow
7351,201,until he stood
7352,201,incandescent as a god;
7353,201,
7354,201,now there is nowhere i can go
7355,201,"to hide from him,"
7356,201,"moon and sun reflect his flame,"
7357,201,
7358,201,in the morning all shall be
7359,201,"the same again,"
7360,201,stars pale before the angry dawn;
7361,201,
7362,201,the gilded cock will turn for me
7363,201,the rack of time
7364,201,until the peak of noon has come
7365,201,
7366,201,"and by that glare, my love will see"
7367,201,how i am still
7368,201,"blazing in my golden hell,"
7369,202,"clocks cry, stillness is a lie, my dear;"
7370,202,"the wheels revolve, the universe keeps running,"
7371,202,"proud you halt upon the spiral stair,"
7372,202,
7373,202,"the asteroids turn traitor in the air,"
7374,202,and planets plot with old elliptic cunning;
7375,202,"clocks cry, stillness is a lie, my dear,"
7376,202,
7377,202,"red the unraveled rose sings in your hair,"
7378,202,"blood springs eternal if the heart be burning,"
7379,202,"proud you halt upon the spiral stair,"
7380,202,
7381,202,"cryptic stars wind up the atmosphere,"
7382,202,in solar schemes the titled suns go turning;
7383,202,"clocks cry, stillness is a lie, my dear,"
7384,202,
7385,202,"loud the immortal nightingales declare,"
7386,202,"love flames forever if the flesh be yearning,"
7387,202,"proud you halt upon the spiral stair,"
7388,202,
7389,202,"circling zodiac compels the year,"
7390,202,"intolerant beauty never will be learning,"
7391,202,"clocks cry, stillness is a lie, my dear,"
7392,202,"proud you halt upon the spiral stair,"
7393,203,"the engine is killing the track, the track is silver,"
7394,203,"it stretches into the distance, it will be eaten nevertheless,"
7395,203,
7396,203,"its running is useless,"
7397,203,"at nightfall there is the beauty of drowned fields,"
7398,203,
7399,203,"dawn gilds the farmers like pigs,"
7400,203,"swaying slightly in their thick suits,"
7401,203,
7402,203,"white towers of smithfield ahead,"
7403,203,"fat haunches and blood on their minds,"
7404,203,
7405,203,"there is no mercy in the glitter of cleavers,"
7406,203,"the butcher's guillotine that whispers, 'how's this, how's this?'"
7407,203,
7408,203,"in the bowl the hare is aborted,"
7409,203,"its baby head out of the way, embalmed in spice,"
7410,203,
7411,203,"flayed of fur and humanity,"
7412,203,"let us eat it like plato's afterbirth,"
7413,203,
7414,203,"let us eat it like christ,"
7415,203,these are the people that were important ----
7416,203,
7417,203,"their round eyes, their teeth, their grimaces"
7418,203,"on a stick that rattles and clicks, a counterfeit snake,"
7419,203,
7420,203,shall the hood of the cobra appall me ----
7421,203,"the loneliness of its eye, the eye of the mountains"
7422,203,
7423,203,through which the sky eternally threads itself?
7424,203,the world is blood-hot and personal
7425,203,
7426,203,"dawn says, with its blood-flush,"
7427,203,"there is no terminus, only suitcases"
7428,203,
7429,203,out of which the same self unfolds like a suit
7430,203,"bald and shiny, with pockets of wishes,"
7431,203,
7432,203,"notions and tickets, short circuits and folding mirrors,"
7433,203,"i am mad, calls the spider, waving its many arms,"
7434,203,
7435,203,"and in truth it is terrible,"
7436,203,"multiplied in the eyes of the flies,"
7437,203,
7438,203,they buzz like blue children
7439,203,"in nets of the infinite,"
7440,203,
7441,203,roped in at the end by the one
7442,203,"death with its many sticks,"
7443,204,"sing praise for statuary,"
7444,204,for those anchored attitudes
7445,204,and staunch stone eyes that stare
7446,204,through lichen-lid and passing bird-foot
7447,204,at some steadfast mark
7448,204,beyond the inconstant green
7449,204,gallop and flick of light
7450,204,in this precarious park
7451,204,
7452,204,where vivid children twirl
7453,204,like colored tops through time
7454,204,nor stop to understand
7455,204,"how all their play is touch-and-go,"
7456,204,"but, go! they cry, and the swing"
7457,204,arcs up to the tall tree tip;
7458,204,go! and the merry-go-round
7459,204,"hauls them round with it,"
7460,204,
7461,204,"and i, like the children, caught"
7462,204,"in the mortal active verb,"
7463,204,let my transient eye break a tear
7464,204,"for each quick, flaring game"
7465,204,"of child, leaf and cloud,"
7466,204,"while on this same fugue, unmoved,"
7467,204,"those stonier eyes look,"
7468,204,"safe-socketed in rock,"
7469,205,"the tulips are too excitable, it is winter here,"
7470,205,"look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in"
7471,205,"i am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly"
7472,205,"as the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands,"
7473,205,"i am nobody; i have nothing to do with explosions,"
7474,205,i have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses
7475,205,"and my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons,"
7476,205,
7477,205,they have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff
7478,205,"like an eye between two white lids that will not shut,"
7479,205,"stupid pupil, it has to take everything in,"
7480,205,"the nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,"
7481,205,"they pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,"
7482,205,"doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,"
7483,205,"so it is impossible to tell how many there are,"
7484,205,
7485,205,"my body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water"
7486,205,"tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently,"
7487,205,"they bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep,"
7488,205,now i have lost myself i am sick of baggage ----
7489,205,"my patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,"
7490,205,my husband and child smiling out of the family photo;
7491,205,"their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks,"
7492,205,
7493,205,"i have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat"
7494,205,"stubbornly hanging on to my name and address,"
7495,205,"they have swabbed me clear of my loving associations,"
7496,205,scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
7497,205,"i watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books"
7498,205,"sink out of sight, and the water went over my head,"
7499,205,"i am a nun now, i have never been so pure,"
7500,205,
7501,205,"i didn't want any flowers, i only wanted"
7502,205,"to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty,"
7503,205,"how free it is, you have no idea how free ----"
7504,205,"the peacefulness is so big it dazes you,"
7505,205,"and it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets,"
7506,205,"it is what the dead close on, finally; i imagine them"
7507,205,"shutting their mouths on it, like a communion tablet,"
7508,205,
7509,205,"the tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me,"
7510,205,even through the gift paper i could hear them breathe
7511,205,"lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby,"
7512,205,"their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds,"
7513,205,"they are subtle, they seem to float, though they weigh me down,"
7514,205,"upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour,"
7515,205,"a dozen red lead sinkers round my neck,"
7516,205,
7517,205,"nobody watched me before, now i am watched,"
7518,205,"the tulips turn to me, and the window behind me"
7519,205,"where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,"
7520,205,"and i see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow"
7521,205,"between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,"
7522,205,"and i hve no face, i have wanted to efface myself,"
7523,205,"the vivid tulips eat my oxygen,"
7524,205,
7525,205,"before they came the air was calm enough,"
7526,205,"coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss,"
7527,205,"then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise,"
7528,205,now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
7529,205,"snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine,"
7530,205,"they concentrate my attention, that was happy"
7531,205,"playing and resting without committing itself,"
7532,205,
7533,205,"the walls, also, seem to be warming themselves,"
7534,205,the tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
7535,205,"they are opening like the mouth of some great african cat,"
7536,205,"and i am aware of my heart, it opens and closes"
7537,205,"its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me,"
7538,205,"the water i taste is warm and salt, like the sea,"
7539,205,"and comes from a country far away as health,"
7540,206,"rock lake, canada"
7541,206,
7542,206,in this country there is neither measure nor balance
7543,206,"to redress the dominance of rocks and woods,"
7544,206,"the passage, say, of these man-shaming clouds,"
7545,206,
7546,206,"no gesture of yours or mine could catch their attention,"
7547,206,no word make them carry water or fire the kindling
7548,206,"like local trolls in the spell of a superior being,"
7549,206,
7550,206,"well, one wearies of the public gardens,  one wants a vacation"
7551,206,where trees and clouds and animals pay no notice;
7552,206,"away from the labeled elms, the tame tea-roses,"
7553,206,
7554,206,it took three days driving north to find a cloud
7555,206,"the polite skies over boston couldn't possibly accommodate,"
7556,206,"here on the last frontier of the big, brash spirit"
7557,206,
7558,206,the horizons are too far off to be chummy as uncles;
7559,206,"the colors assert themselves with a sort of vengeance,"
7560,206,each day concludes in a huge splurge of vermilions
7561,206,
7562,206,"and night arrives in one gigantic step,"
7563,206,"it is comfortable, for a change, to mean so little,"
7564,206,"these rocks offer no purchase to herbage or people,"
7565,206,
7566,206,"they are conceiving a dynasty of perfect cold,"
7567,206,"in a month we'll wonder what plates and forks are for,"
7568,206,"i lean to you, numb as a fossil,  tell me i'm here,"
7569,206,
7570,206,"the pilgrims and indians might never have happened,"
7571,206,planets pulse in the lake like bright amoebas;
7572,206,"the pines blot our voices up in their lightest sighs,"
7573,206,
7574,206,around our tent the old simplicities sough
7575,206,"sleepily as lethe, trying to get in,"
7576,206,"we'll wake blank-brained as water in the dawn,"
7577,207,"cold and final, the imagination"
7578,207,shuts down its fabled summer house;
7579,207,blue views are boarded up; our sweet vacation
7580,207,"dwindles in the hour-glass,"
7581,207,
7582,207,thoughts that found a maze of mermaid hair
7583,207,tangling in the tide's green fall
7584,207,now fold their wings like bats and disappear
7585,207,"into the attic of the skull,"
7586,207,
7587,207,we are not what we might be; what we are
7588,207,outlaws all extrapolation
7589,207,"beyond the interval of now and here,"
7590,207,"white whales are gone with the white ocean,"
7591,207,
7592,207,a lone beachcomber squats among the wrack
7593,207,of kaleidoscope shells
7594,207,probing fractured venus with a stick
7595,207,"under a tent of taunting gulls,"
7596,207,
7597,207,no sea-change decks the sunken shank of bone
7598,207,that chucks in backtrack of the wave;
7599,207,"though the mind like an oyster labors on and on,"
7600,207,"a grain of sand is all we have,"
7601,207,
7602,207,water will run by; the actual sun
7603,207,will scrupulously rise and set;
7604,207,no little man lives in the exacting moon
7605,207,"and that is that, is that, is that,"
7606,208,"two girls there are , within the house"
7607,208,"one sits; the other, without,"
7608,208,daylong a duet of shade and light
7609,208,"plays between these,"
7610,208,
7611,208,in her dark wainscoted room
7612,208,the first works problems on
7613,208,"a mathematical machine,"
7614,208,dry ticks mark time
7615,208,
7616,208,"as she calculates each sum,"
7617,208,at this barren enterprise
7618,208,"rat-shrewd go her squint eyes,"
7619,208,"root-pale her meager frame,"
7620,208,
7621,208,"bronzed as earth, the second lies,"
7622,208,hearing ticks blown gold
7623,208,"like pollen on bright air, lulled"
7624,208,"near a bed of poppies,"
7625,208,
7626,208,she sees how their red silk flare
7627,208,of petaled blood
7628,208,"burns open to the sun's blade,"
7629,208,on that green alter
7630,208,
7631,208,"freely become sun's bride, the latter"
7632,208,"grows quick with seed,"
7633,208,"grass-couched in her labor's pride,"
7634,208,"she bears a king, turned bitter"
7635,208,
7636,208,"and sallow as any lemon,"
7637,208,"the other, wry virgin to the last,"
7638,208,"goes graveward with flesh laid waste,"
7639,208,"worm-husbanded, yet no woman,"
7640,209,1
7641,209,the day she visited the dissecting room

8043,221,this is the time of hanging on for the bees--the bees
8044,221,"so slow i hardly know them,"
8045,221,filing like soldiers
8046,221,to the syrup tin
8047,221,
8048,221,"to make up for the honey i've taken,"
8049,221,"tate and lyle keeps them going,"
8050,221,"the refined snow,"
8051,221,"it is tate and lyle they live on, instead of flowers,"
8052,221,"they take it, the cold sets in,"
8053,221,
8054,221,"now they ball in a mass,"
8055,221,black
8056,221,"mind against all that white,"
8057,221,"the smile of the snow is white,"
8058,221,"it spreads itself out, a mile-long body of meissen,"
8059,221,
8060,221,"into which, on warm days,"
8061,221,"they can only carry their dead,"
8062,221,"the bees are all women,"
8063,221,"maids and the long royal lady,"
8064,221,"they have got rid of the men,"
8065,221,
8066,221,"the blunt, clumsy stumblers, the boors,"
8067,221,winter is for women ----
8068,221,"the woman, still at her knitting,"
8069,221,"at the cradle of spanis walnut,"
8070,221,"her body a bulb in the cold and too dumb to think,"
8071,221,
8072,221,"will the hive survive, will the gladiolas"
8073,221,succeed in banking their fires
8074,221,to enter another year?
8075,221,"what will they taste of, the christmas roses?"
8076,221,"the bees are flying, they taste the spring,"
8077,222,"in the marketplace they are piling the dry sticks,"
8078,222,"a thicket of shadows is a poor coat, i inhabit"
8079,222,"the wax image of myself, a doll's body,"
8080,222,"sickness begins here, i am the dartboard for witches,"
8081,222,"only the devil can eat teh devil out,"
8082,222,"in the month of red leaves i climb to a bed of fire,"
8083,222,
8084,222,"it is easy to blame the dark, the mouth of a door,"
8085,222,"the cellar's belly, they've blown my sparkler out,"
8086,222,"a black-sharded lady keeps me in parrot cage,"
8087,222,what large eyes the dead have!
8088,222,"i am intimate with a hairy spirit,"
8089,222,"smoke wheels from the beak of this empty jar,"
8090,222,
8091,222,"if i am a little one, i can do no harm,"
8092,222,"if i don't move about, i'll knock nothing over, so i said,"
8093,222,"sitting under a potlid, tiny and inert as a rice grain,"
8094,222,"they are turning the burners up, ring after ring,"
8095,222,"we are full of starch, my small white fellows, we grow,"
8096,222,"it hurts at first, the red tongues will teach the truth,"
8097,222,
8098,222,"mother of beetles, only unclench your hand,"
8099,222,"i'll fly through the candles' mouth like a singeless moth,"
8100,222,"give me back my shape, i am ready to construe the days"
8101,222,"i coupled with dust in the shadow of a stone,"
8102,222,"my ankles brighten, brightness ascends my thighs,"
8103,222,"i am lost, i am lost, in the roves of all this light,"
8104,223,axes
8105,223,"after whose stroke the wood rings,"
8106,223,and the echoes!
8107,223,echoes traveling
8108,223,"off from the center like horses,"
8109,223,
8110,223,the sap
8111,223,"wells like tears, like the"
8112,223,water striving
8113,223,to re-establish its mirror
8114,223,over the rock
8115,223,
8116,223,"that drops and turns,"
8117,223,"a white skull,"
8118,223,"eaten by weedy greens,"
8119,223,years later i
8120,223,encounter them on the road-
8121,223,
8122,223,"words dry and riderless,"
8123,223,"the indefatigable hoof-taps,"
8124,223,while
8125,223,"from the bottom of the pool, fixed stars"
8126,223,"govern a life,"
8127,224,"o mud, mud, how fluid! ---"
8128,224,"thick as foreign coffee, and with a sluggy pulse,"
8129,224,"speak, speak! who is it?"
8130,224,"it is the bowel-pulse, lover of digestibles,"
8131,224,"it is he who has achieved these syllables,"
8132,224,
8133,224,"what are these words, these words?"
8134,224,"they are plopping like mud,"
8135,224,"o god, how shall i ever clean the phone table?"
8136,224,"they are pressing out of the many-holed earpiece, they are looking for a"
8137,224,"listener,"
8138,224,is he here?
8139,224,
8140,224,"now the room is ahiss, the instrument"
8141,224,"withdraws its tentacle,"
8142,224,"but the spawn percolate in my heart, they are fertile,"
8143,224,"muck funnel, muck funnel --"
8144,224,"you are too big, they must take you back!"
8145,225,"the horizons ring me like faggots,"
8146,225,"tilted and disparate, and always unstable,"
8147,225,"touched by a match, they might warm me,"
8148,225,and their fine lines singe
8149,225,the air to orange
8150,225,"before the distances they pin evaporate,"
8151,225,"weighting the pale sky with a soldier color,"
8152,225,but they only dissolve and dissolve
8153,225,"like a series of promises, as i step forward,"
8154,225,
8155,225,there is no life higher than the grasstops
8156,225,"or the hearts of sheep, and the wind"
8157,225,"pours by like destiny, bending"
8158,225,"everything in one direction,"
8159,225,i can feel it trying
8160,225,"to funnel my heat away,"
8161,225,if i pay the roots of the heather
8162,225,"too close attention, they will invite me"
8163,225,"to whiten my bones among them,"
8164,225,
8165,225,"the sheep know where they are,"
8166,225,"browsing in their dirty wool-clouds,"
8167,225,"gray as the weather,"
8168,225,"the black slots of their pupils take me in,"
8169,225,"it is like being mailed into space,"
8170,225,"a thin, silly message,"
8171,225,"they stand about in grandmotherly disguise,"
8172,225,all wig curls and yellow teeth
8173,225,"and hard, marbly baas,"
8174,225,
8175,225,"i come to wheel ruts, and water"
8176,225,limpid as the solitudes
8177,225,"that flee through my fingers,"
8178,225,hollow doorsteps go from grass to grass;
8179,225,"lintel and sill have unhinged themselves,"
8180,225,of people and the air only
8181,225,"remembers a few odd syllables,"
8182,225,"it rehearses them moaningly,"
8183,225,"black stone, black stone,"
8184,225,
8185,225,"the sky leans on me, me, the one upright"
8186,225,"among all horizontals,"
8187,225,"the grass is beating its head distractedly,"
8188,225,it is too delicate
8189,225,for a life in such company;
8190,225,"darkness terrifies it,"
8191,225,"now, in valleys narrow"
8192,225,"and black as purses, the house lights"
8193,225,"gleam like small change,"
8194,226,woodsmoke and a distant loudspeaker
8195,226,filter into this clear
8196,226,"air, and blur,"
8197,226,
8198,226,"the red tomato's in, the green bean;"
8199,226,the cook lugs a pumpkin
8200,226,from the vine
8201,226,
8202,226,"for pies, the fir tree's thick with grackles,"
8203,226,"gold carp loom in the pools,"
8204,226,a wasp crawls
8205,226,
8206,226,"over windfalls to sip cider-juice,"
8207,226,guests in the studios
8208,226,"muse, compose,"
8209,226,
8210,226,"indoors, tiffany's phoenix rises"
8211,226,above the fireplace;
8212,226,two carved sleighs
8213,226,
8214,226,"rest on orange plush near the newel post,"
8215,226,"wood stoves burn warm as toast,"
8216,226,the late guest
8217,226,
8218,226,"wakens, mornings, to a cobalt sky,"
8219,226,"a diamond-paned window,"
8220,226,"zinc-white snow,"
8221,227,"yadwigha, the literalists once wondered how you"
8222,227,came to be lying on this baroque couch
8223,227,"upholstered in red velvet, under the eye"
8224,227,"of uncaged tigers and a tropical moon,"
8225,227,set in intricate wilderness of green
8226,227,"heart-shaped leaves, like catalpa leaves, and lillies"
8227,227,
8228,227,"of monstrous size, like no well-bred lilies"
8229,227,it seems teh consistent critics wanted you
8230,227,to choose between your world of jungle green
8231,227,and the fashionable monde of the red couch
8232,227,"with its prim bric-à-brac, without a moon"
8233,227,"to turn you luminous, without the eye"
8234,227,
8235,227,of tigers to be stilled by your dark eye
8236,227,"and body whiter than its frill of lilies,"
8237,227,"they'd have had yellow silk screening the moon,"
8238,227,leaves and lilies flattened to paper behind you
8239,227,"or, at most, to a mille-fleurs tapestry, but the couch"
8240,227,"stood stubborn in it's jungle, red against green,"
8241,227,
8242,227,"red against fifty variants of green,"
8243,227,"the couch glared out at the prosaic eye,"
8244,227,"so rousseau, to explain why the red couch"
8245,227,"persisted in the picture with the lilies,"
8246,227,"tigers, snakes, and the snakecharmer and you,"
8247,227,"and birds of paradise, and the round moon,"
8248,227,
8249,227,described how you fell dreaming at full of moon
8250,227,on a red velvet couch within your green-
8251,227,"tessellared boudoir, hearing flutes, you"
8252,227,dreamed yourself away in the moon's eye
8253,227,"to a beryl jungle, and dreamed that bright moon-lilies"
8254,227,"nodded their petaled heads around your couch,"
8255,227,
8256,227,"and that, rousseau told the critics, was why the couch"
8257,227,"accompanied you, so they nodded at the couch with the moon"
8258,227,"and the snakecharmer's song and the gigantic lilies,"
8259,227,"marvelingly numbered the many shades of green,"
8260,227,"but to a friend, in private, rousseau confessed his eye"
8261,227,"so possessed by the glowing red of the couch which you,"
8262,227,
8263,227,"yadwigha, pose on, that he put you on the couch"
8264,227,"to feed his eye with red, such red! under the moon,"
8265,227,in the midst of all that green and those great lilies!
8266,228,they enter as animals from the outer
8267,228,space of holly where spikes
8268,228,"are not thoughts i turn on, like a yogi,"
8269,228,"but greenness, darkness so pure"
8270,228,"they freeze and are,"
8271,228,
8272,228,"o god, i am not like you"
8273,228,"in your vacuous black,"
8274,228,"stars stuck all over, bright stupid confetti,"
8275,228,"eternity bores me,"
8276,228,"i never wanted it,"
8277,228,
8278,228,what i love is
8279,228,"the piston in motion , , ,"
8280,228,"my soul dies before it,"
8281,228,"and the hooves of the horses,"
8282,228,"there merciless churn,"
8283,228,
8284,228,"and you, great stasis , , ,"
8285,228,what is so great in that!
8286,228,"is it a tiger this year, this roar at the door?"
8287,228,"it is a christus,"
8288,228,the awful
8289,228,
8290,228,god-bit in him
8291,228,dying to fly and be done with it?
8292,228,"the blood berries are themselves, they are very still,"
8293,228,
8294,228,"the hooves will not have it,"
8295,228,"in blue distance the pistons hiss,"
8296,229,"clownlike, happiest on your hands,"
8297,229,"feet to the stars, and moon-skulled,"
8298,229,"gilled like a fish, a common-sense"
8299,229,"thumbs-down on the dodo's mode,"
8300,229,"wrapped up in yourself like a spool,"
8301,229,"trawling your dark, as owls do,"
8302,229,mute as a turnip from the fourth
8303,229,"of july to all fools' day,"
8304,229,"o high-riser, my little loaf,"
8305,229,
8306,229,"vague as fog and looked for like mail,"
8307,229,"farther off than australia,"
8308,229,"bent-backed atlas, our traveled prawn,"
8309,229,snug as a bud and at home
8310,229,"like a sprat in a pickle jug,"
8311,229,"a creel of eels, all ripples,"
8312,229,"jumpy as a mexican bean,"
8313,229,"right, like a well-done sum,"
8314,229,"a clean slate, with your own face on,"
