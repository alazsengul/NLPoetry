510,13,"fear, we cry for you"
511,13,although we have lost
512,13,"your name,"
513,14,you may write me down in history
514,14,"with your bitter, twisted lies,"
515,14,you may trod me in the very dirt
516,14,"but still, like dust, i'll rise,"
517,14,
518,14,does my sassiness upset you?
519,14,why are you beset with gloom?
520,14,'cause i walk like i've got oil wells
521,14,"pumping in my living room,"
522,14,
523,14,"just like moons and like suns,"
524,14,"with the certainty of tides,"
525,14,"just like hopes springing high,"
526,14,"still i'll rise,"
527,14,
528,14,did you want to see me broken?
529,14,bowed head and lowered eyes?
530,14,"shoulders falling down like teardrops,"
531,14,"weakened by my soulful cries,"
532,14,
533,14,does my haughtiness offend you?
534,14,don't you take it awful hard
535,14,'cause i laugh like i've got gold mines
536,14,"diggin' in my own back yard,"
537,14,
538,14,"you may shoot me with your words,"
539,14,"you may cut me with your eyes,"
540,14,"you may kill me with your hatefulness,"
541,14,"but still, like air, i'll rise,"
542,14,
543,14,does my sexiness upset you?
544,14,does it come as a surprise
545,14,that i dance like i've got diamonds
546,14,at the meeting of my thighs?
547,14,
548,14,out of the huts of history's shame
549,14,i rise
550,14,up from a past that's rooted in pain
551,14,i rise
552,14,"i'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,"
553,14,"welling and swelling i bear in the tide,"
554,14,leaving behind nights of terror and fear
555,14,i rise
556,14,into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
557,14,i rise
558,14,"bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,"
559,14,"i am the dream and the hope of the slave,"
560,14,i rise
561,14,i rise
562,14,"i rise,"
563,15,"i keep on dying again, "
564,15,"veins collapse, opening like the "
565,15,small fists of sleeping 
566,15,"children, "
567,15,"memory of old tombs, "
568,15,rotting flesh and worms do 
569,15,not convince me against 
570,15,"the challenge, the years "
571,15,and cold defeat live deep in 
572,15,"lines along my face, "
573,15,"they dull my eyes, yet "
574,15,"i keep on dying, "
575,15,"because i love to live,"
576,16,"a rock, a river, a tree "
577,16,"hosts to species long since departed, "
578,16,"mark the mastodon, "
579,16,"the dinosaur, who left dry tokens "
580,16,of their sojourn here 
581,16,"on our planet floor, "
582,16,any broad alarm of their of their hastening doom 
583,16,"is lost in the gloom of dust and ages, "
584,16,"but today, the rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully, "
585,16,"come, you may stand upon my "
586,16,"back and face your distant destiny, "
587,16,"but seek no haven in my shadow, "
588,16,"i will give you no hiding place down here, "
589,16,"you, created only a little lower than "
590,16,"the angels, have crouched too long in "
591,16,"the bruising darkness, "
592,16,have lain too long 
593,16,"face down in ignorance, "
594,16,your mouths spelling words 
595,16,"armed for slaughter, "
596,16,"the rock cries out today, you may stand on me, "
597,16,"but do not hide your face, "
598,16,"across the wall of the world, "
599,16,"a river sings a beautiful song, "
600,16,"come rest here by my side, "
601,16,"each of you a bordered country, "
602,16,"delicate and strangely made proud, "
603,16,"yet thrusting perpetually under siege, "
604,16,your armed struggles for profit 
605,16,have left collars of waste upon 
606,16,"my shore, currents of debris upon my breast, "
607,16,"yet, today i call you to my riverside, "
608,16,"if you will study war no more, "
609,16,"come, clad in peace and i will sing the songs "
610,16,the creator gave to me when i 
611,16,"and the tree and stone were one, "
612,16,before cynicism was a bloody sear across your brow 
613,16,"and when you yet knew you still knew nothing, "
614,16,"the river sings and sings on, "
615,16,there is a true yearning to respond to 
616,16,"the singing river and the wise rock, "
617,16,"so say the asian, the hispanic, the jew, "
618,16,"the african and native american, the sioux, "
619,16,"the catholic, the muslim, the french, the greek, "
620,16,"the irish, the rabbi, the priest, the sheikh, "
621,16,"the gay, the straight, the preacher, "
622,16,"the privileged, the homeless, the teacher, "
623,16,"they hear, they all hear "
624,16,"the speaking of the tree, "
625,16,"today, the first and last of every tree "
626,16,"speaks to humankind, come to me, here beside the river, "
627,16,"plant yourself beside me, here beside the river, "
628,16,"each of you, descendant of some passed on "
629,16,"traveller, has been paid for, "
630,16,"you, who gave me my first name, "
631,16,"you pawnee, apache and seneca, "
632,16,"you cherokee nation, who rested with me, "
633,16,"then forced on bloody feet, "
634,16,left me to the employment of other seekers-- 
635,16,"desperate for gain, starving for gold, "
636,16,"you, the turk, the swede, the german, the scot, "
637,16,"you the ashanti, the yoruba, the kru, "
638,16,"bought, sold, stolen, arriving on a nightmare "
639,16,"praying for a dream, "
640,16,"here, root yourselves beside me, "
641,16,"i am the tree planted by the river, "
642,16,"which will not be moved, "
643,16,"i, the rock, i the river, i the tree "
644,16,"i am yours--your passages have been paid, "
645,16,"lift up your faces, you have a piercing need "
646,16,"for this bright morning dawning for you, "
647,16,"history, despite its wrenching pain, "
648,16,"cannot be unlived, and if faced with courage, "
649,16,"need not be lived again, "
650,16,lift up your eyes upon 
651,16,"the day breaking for you, "
652,16,give birth again 
653,16,"to the dream, "
654,16,"women, children, men, "
655,16,"take it into the palms of your hands, "
656,16,mold it into the shape of your most 
657,16,"private need, sculpt it into "
658,16,"the image of your most public self, "
659,16,"lift up your hearts, "
660,16,each new hour holds new chances 
661,16,"for new beginnings, "
662,16,do not be wedded forever 
663,16,"to fear, yoked eternally "
664,16,"to brutishness, "
665,16,"the horizon leans forward, "
666,16,"offering you space to place new steps of change, "
667,16,"here, on the pulse of this fine day "
668,16,you may have the courage 
669,16,"to look up and out upon me, "
670,16,"the rock, the river, the tree, your country, "
671,16,"no less to midas than the mendicant, "
672,16,"no less to you now than the mastodon then, "
673,16,here on the pulse of this new day 
674,16,you may have the grace to look up and out 
675,16,"and into your sister's eyes, "
676,16,"into your brother's face, your country "
677,16,and say simply 
678,16,very simply 
679,16,with hope 
680,16,"good morning,"
681,17,"we, unaccustomed to courage "
682,17,exiles from delight 
683,17,live coiled in shells of loneliness 
684,17,until love leaves its high holy temple 
685,17,and comes into our sight 
686,17,"to liberate us into life, "
687,17,
688,17,love arrives 
689,17,and in its train come ecstasies 
690,17,old memories of pleasure 
691,17,"ancient histories of pain, "
692,17,"yet if we are bold, "
693,17,love strikes away the chains of fear 
694,17,"from our souls, "
695,17,
696,17,we are weaned from our timidity 
697,17,in the flush of love's light 
698,17,we dare be brave 
699,17,and suddenly we see 
700,17,that love costs all we are 
701,17,"and will ever be, "
702,17,yet it is only love 
703,17,"which sets us free,"
704,18,some clichty folks 
705,18,"don't know the facts, "
706,18,posin' and preenin' 
707,18,"and puttin' on acts, "
708,18,"stretchin' their backs, "
709,18,
710,18,they move into condos 
711,18,"up over the ranks, "
712,18,pawn their souls 
713,18,"to the local banks, "
714,18,buying big cars 
715,18,"they can't afford, "
716,18,ridin' around town 
717,18,"actin' bored, "
718,18,
719,18,if they want to learn how to live life right 
720,18,"they ought to study me on saturday night, "
721,18,
722,18,my job at the plant 
723,18,"ain't the biggest bet, "
724,18,but i pay my bills 
725,18,"and stay out of debt, "
726,18,i get my hair done 
727,18,"for my own self's sake, "
728,18,so i don't have to pick 
729,18,"and i don't have to rake, "
730,18,
731,18,take the church money out 
732,18,and head cross town 
733,18,to my friend girl's house 
734,18,"where we plan our round, "
735,18,we meet our men and go to a joint 
736,18,where the music is blue 
737,18,"and to the point, "
738,18,
739,18,"folks write about me, "
740,18,they just can't see 
741,18,how i work all week 
742,18,"at the factory, "
743,18,then get spruced up 
744,18,and laugh and dance 
745,18,and turn away from worry 
746,18,"with sassy glance, "
747,18,
748,18,they accuse me of livin' 
749,18,"from day to day, "
750,18,but who are they kiddin'? 
751,18,"so are they, "
752,18,
753,18,my life ain't heaven 
754,18,"but it sure ain't hell, "
755,18,i'm not on top 
756,18,but i call it swell 
757,18,if i'm able to work 
758,18,and get paid right 
759,18,and have the luck to be black 
760,18,"on a saturday night,"
761,19,"when you come to me, unbidden, "
762,19,beckoning me 
763,19,"to long-ago rooms, "
764,19,"where memories lie, "
765,19,
766,19,"offering me, as to a child, an attic, "
767,19,"gatherings of days too few, "
768,19,"baubles of stolen kisses, "
769,19,"trinkets of borrowed loves, "
770,19,"trunks of secret words, "
771,19,
772,19,"i cry,"
773,20,i've got the children to tend 
774,20,the clothes to mend 
775,20,the floor to mop 
776,20,the food to shop 
777,20,then the chicken to fry 
778,20,the baby to dry 
779,20,i got company to feed 
780,20,the garden to weed 
781,20,i've got shirts to press 
782,20,the tots to dress 
783,20,the can to be cut 
784,20,i gotta clean up this hut 
785,20,then see about the sick 
786,20,"and the cotton to pick, "
787,20,
788,20,"shine on me, sunshine "
789,20,"rain on me, rain "
790,20,"fall softly, dewdrops "
791,20,"and cool my brow again, "
792,20,
793,20,"storm, blow me from here "
794,20,with your fiercest wind 
795,20,let me float across the sky 
796,20,"'til i can rest again, "
797,20,
798,20,"fall gently, snowflakes "
799,20,cover me with white 
800,20,cold icy kisses and 
801,20,"let me rest tonight, "
802,20,
803,20,"sun, rain, curving sky "
804,20,"mountain, oceans, leaf and stone "
805,20,"star shine, moon glow "
806,20,"you're all that i can call my own,"
