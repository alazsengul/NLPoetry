0,0,"one christmas was so much like another, in those years around the sea-town corner now and out of all sound except the distant speaking of the voices i sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that i can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when i was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when i was six,"
1,0,
2,0,"all the christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea, like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street; and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged fish-freezing waves, and i plunge my hands in the snow and bring out whatever i can find, in goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting at the rim of the carol-singing sea, and out come mrs, prothero and the firemen,"
3,0,
4,0,"it was on the afternoon of the christmas eve, and i was in mrs, prothero's garden, waiting for cats, with her son jim, it was snowing, it was always snowing at christmas, december, in my memory, is white as lapland, though there were no reindeer's, but there were cats, patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats, sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slink and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, jim and i, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from hudson bay, off mumbles road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes, the wise cats never appeared,"
5,0,
6,0,"we were so still, eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows - eternal, ever since wednesday - that we never heard mrs, prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden, or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat, but soon the voice grew louder,"
7,0,"fire! cried mrs, prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong,"
8,0,
9,0,"and we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, toward the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and mrs, prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in pompeii, this was better than all the cats in wales standing on the wall in a row, we bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room,"
10,0,
11,0,"something was burning all right; perhaps it was mr, prothero, who always slept there after midday dinner with a newspaper over his face, but he was standing in the middle of the room, saying, a fine christmas! and smacking at the smoke with a slipper,"
12,0,
13,0,"call the fire brigade, cried mrs, prothero as she beat the gong,"
14,0,"there won't be there, said mr, prothero, it's christmas,"
15,0,"there was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and mr, prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting,"
16,0,"do something, he said, and we threw all our snowballs into the smoke - i think we missed mr, prothero - and ran out of the house to the telephone box,"
17,0,"let's call the police as well, jim said, and the ambulance, and ernie jenkins, he likes fires,"
18,0,
19,0,"but we only called the fire brigade, and soon the fire engine came and three tall men in helmets brought a hose into the house and mr, prothero got out just in time before they turned it on, nobody could have had a noisier christmas eve, and when the firemen turned off the hose and were standing in the wet, smoky room, jim's aunt, miss, prothero, came downstairs and peered in at them, jim and i waited, very quietly, to hear what she would say to them, she said the right thing, always, she looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said, would you like anything to read?"
20,0,
21,0,"years and years ago, when i was a boy, when there were wolves in wales, and birds the color of red-flannel petticoats whisked past the harp-shaped hills, when we sang and wallowed all night and day in caves that smelt like sunday afternoons in damp front farmhouse parlors, and we chased, with the jawbones of deacons, the english and the bears, before the motor car, before the wheel, before the duchess-faced horse, when we rode the daft and happy hills bareback, it snowed and it snowed, but here a small boy says, it snowed last year, too, i made a snowman and my brother knocked it down and i knocked my brother down and then we had tea,"
22,0,
23,0,"but that was not the same snow, i say, our snow was not only shaken from white wash buckets down the sky, it came shawling out of the ground and swam and drifted out of the arms and hands and bodies of the trees; snow grew overnight on the roofs of the houses like a pure and grandfather moss, minutely -ivied the walls and settled on the postman, opening the gate, like a dumb, numb thunder-storm of white, torn christmas cards,"
24,0,
25,0,"were there postmen then, too?"
26,0,"with sprinkling eyes and wind-cherried noses, on spread, frozen feet they crunched up to the doors and mittened on them manfully, but all that the children could hear was a ringing of bells,"
27,0,you mean that the postman went rat-a-tat-tat and the doors rang?
28,0,"i mean that the bells the children could hear were inside them,"
29,0,"i only hear thunder sometimes, never bells,"
30,0,"there were church bells, too,"
31,0,inside them?
32,0,"no, no, no, in the bat-black, snow-white belfries, tugged by bishops and storks, and they rang their tidings over the bandaged town, over the frozen foam of the powder and ice-cream hills, over the crackling sea, it seemed that all the churches boomed for joy under my window; and the weathercocks crew for christmas, on our fence,"
33,0,
34,0,get back to the postmen
35,0,"they were just ordinary postmen, found of walking and dogs and christmas and the snow, they knocked on the doors with blue knuckles ,,"
36,0,"ours has got a black knocker,,"
37,0,"and then they stood on the white welcome mat in the little, drifted porches and huffed and puffed, making ghosts with their breath, and jogged from foot to foot like small boys wanting to go out,"
38,0,and then the presents?
39,0,"and then the presents, after the christmas box, and the cold postman, with a rose on his button-nose, tingled down the tea-tray-slithered run of the chilly glinting hill, he went in his ice-bound boots like a man on fishmonger's slabs,"
40,0,"he wagged his bag like a frozen camel's hump, dizzily turned the corner on one foot, and, by god, he was gone,"
41,0,
42,0,"get back to the presents,"
43,0,"there were the useful presents, engulfing mufflers of the old coach days, and mittens made for giant sloths; zebra scarfs of a substance like silky gum that could be tug-o'-warred down to the galoshes; blinding tam-o'-shanters like patchwork tea cozies and bunny-suited busbies and balaclavas for victims of head-shrinking tribes; from aunts who always wore wool next to the skin there were mustached and rasping vests that made you wonder why the aunts had any skin left at all; and once i had a little crocheted nose bag from an aunt now, alas, no longer whinnying with us, and pictureless books in which small boys, though warned with quotations not to, would skate on farmer giles' pond and did and drowned; and books that told me everything about the wasp, except why,"
44,0,
45,0,"go on the useless presents,"
46,0,"bags of moist and many-colored jelly babies and a folded flag and a false nose and a tram-conductor's cap and a machine that punched tickets and rang a bell; never a catapult; once, by mistake that no one could explain, a little hatchet; and a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unducklike sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow; and a painting book in which i could make the grass, the trees, the sea and the animals any colour i pleased, and still the dazzling sky-blue sheep are grazing in the red field under the rainbow-billed and pea-green birds, hardboileds, toffee, fudge and allsorts, crunches, cracknels, humbugs, glaciers, marzipan, and butterwelsh for the welsh, and troops of bright tin soldiers who, if they could not fight, could always run, and snakes-and-families and happy ladders, and easy hobbi-games for little engineers, complete with instructions, oh, easy for leonardo! and a whistle to make the dogs bark to wake up the old man next door to make him beat on the wall with his stick to shake our picture off the wall, and a packet of cigarettes, you put one in your mouth and you stood at the corner of the street and you waited for hours, in vain, for an old lady to scold you for smoking a cigarette, and then with a smirk you ate it, and then it was breakfast under the balloons,"
47,0,
48,0,were there uncles like in our house?
49,0,"there are always uncles at christmas, the same uncles, and on christmas morning, with dog-disturbing whistle and sugar fags, i would scour the swatched town for the news of the little world, and find always a dead bird by the post office or by the white deserted swings; perhaps a robin, all but one of his fires out, men and women wading or scooping back from chapel, with taproom noses and wind-bussed cheeks, all albinos, huddles their stiff black jarring feathers against the irreligious snow, mistletoe hung from the gas brackets in all the front parlors; there was sherry and walnuts and bottled beer and crackers by the dessertspoons; and cats in their fur-abouts watched the fires; and the high-heaped fire spat, all ready for the chestnuts and the mulling pokers, some few large men sat in the front parlors, without their collars, uncles almost certainly, trying their new cigars, holding them out judiciously at arms' length, returning them to their mouths, coughing, then holding them out again as though waiting for the explosion; and some few small aunts, not wanted in the kitchen, nor anywhere else for that matter, sat on the very edge of their chairs, poised and brittle, afraid to break, like faded cups and saucers,"
50,0,
51,0,"not many those mornings trod the piling streets, an old man always, fawn-bowlered, yellow-gloved and, at this time of year, with spats of snow, would take his constitutional to the white bowling green and back, as he would take it wet or fire on christmas day or doomsday; sometimes two hale young men, with big pipes blazing, no overcoats and wind blown scarfs, would trudge, unspeaking, down to the forlorn sea, to work up an appetite, to blow away the fumes, who knows, to walk into the waves until nothing of them was left but the two furling smoke clouds of their inextinguishable briars, then i would be slap-dashing home, the gravy smell of the dinners of others, the bird smell, the brandy, the pudding and mince, coiling up to my nostrils, when out of a snow-clogged side lane would come a boy the spit of myself, with a pink-tipped cigarette and the violet past of a black eye, cocky as a bullfinch, leering all to himself,"
52,0,
53,0,"i hated him on sight and sound, and would be about to put my dog whistle to my lips and blow him off the face of christmas when suddenly he, with a violet wink, put his whistle to his lips and blew so stridently, so high, so exquisitely loud, that gobbling faces, their cheeks bulged with goose, would press against their tinsled windows, the whole length of the white echoing street, for dinner we had turkey and blazing pudding, and after dinner the uncles sat in front of the fire, loosened all buttons, put their large moist hands over their watch chains, groaned a little and slept, mothers, aunts and sisters scuttled to and fro, bearing tureens, auntie bessie, who had already been frightened, twice, by a clock-work mouse, whimpered at the sideboard and had some elderberry wine, the dog was sick, auntie dosie had to have three aspirins, but auntie hannah, who liked port, stood in the middle of the snowbound back yard, singing like a big-bosomed thrush, i would blow up balloons to see how big they would blow up to; and, when they burst, which they all did, the uncles jumped and rumbled, in the rich and heavy afternoon, the uncles breathing like dolphins and the snow descending, i would sit among festoons and chinese lanterns and nibble dates and try to make a model man-o'-war, following the instructions for little engineers, and produce what might be mistaken for a sea-going tramcar,"
54,0,
55,0,"or i would go out, my bright new boots squeaking, into the white world, on to the seaward hill, to call on jim and dan and jack and to pad through the still streets, leaving huge footprints on the hidden pavements,"
56,0,"i bet people will think there's been hippos,"
57,0,what would you do if you saw a hippo coming down our street?
58,0,"i'd go like this, bang! i'd throw him over the railings and roll him down the hill and then i'd tickle him under the ear and he'd wag his tail,"
59,0,what would you do if you saw two hippos?
60,0,
61,0,"iron-flanked and bellowing he-hippos clanked and battered through the scudding snow toward us as we passed mr, daniel's house,"
62,0,"let's post mr, daniel a snow-ball through his letter box,"
63,0,"let's write things in the snow,"
64,0,"let's write, 'mr, daniel looks like a spaniel' all over his lawn,"
65,0,"or we walked on the white shore, can the fishes see it's snowing?"
66,0,
67,0,"the silent one-clouded heavens drifted on to the sea, now we were snow-blind travelers lost on the north hills, and vast dewlapped dogs, with flasks round their necks, ambled and shambled up to us, baying excelsior, we returned home through the poor streets where only a few children fumbled with bare red fingers in the wheel-rutted snow and cat-called after us, their voices fading away, as we trudged uphill, into the cries of the dock birds and the hooting of ships out in the whirling bay, and then, at tea the recovered uncles would be jolly; and the ice cake loomed in the center of the table like a marble grave, auntie hannah laced her tea with rum, because it was only once a year,"
68,0,
69,0,"bring out the tall tales now that we told by the fire as the gaslight bubbled like a diver, ghosts whooed like owls in the long nights when i dared not look over my shoulder; animals lurked in the cubbyhole under the stairs and the gas meter ticked, and i remember that we went singing carols once, when there wasn't the shaving of a moon to light the flying streets, at the end of a long road was a drive that led to a large house, and we stumbled up the darkness of the drive that night, each one of us afraid, each one holding a stone in his hand in case, and all of us too brave to say a word, the wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant and maybe webfooted men wheezing in caves, we reached the black bulk of the house, what shall we give them? hark the herald?"
70,0,"no, jack said, good king wencelas, i'll count three, one, two three, and we began to sing, our voices high and seemingly distant in the snow-felted darkness round the house that was occupied by nobody we knew, we stood close together, near the dark door, good king wencelas looked out on the feast of stephen , and then a small, dry voice, like the voice of someone who has not spoken for a long time, joined our singing, a small, dry, eggshell voice from the other side of the door, a small dry voice through the keyhole, and when we stopped running we were outside our house; the front room was lovely; balloons floated under the hot-water-bottle-gulping gas; everything was good again and shone over the town,"
71,0,"perhaps it was a ghost, jim said,"
72,0,"perhaps it was trolls, dan said, who was always reading,"
73,0,"let's go in and see if there's any jelly left, jack said, and we did that,"
74,0,
75,0,"always on christmas night there was music, an uncle played the fiddle, a cousin sang cherry ripe, and another uncle sang drake's drum, it was very warm in the little house, auntie hannah, who had got on to the parsnip wine, sang a song about bleeding hearts and death, and then another in which she said her heart was like a bird's nest; and then everybody laughed again; and then i went to bed, looking through my bedroom window, out into the moonlight and the unending smoke-colored snow, i could see the lights in the windows of all the other houses on our hill and hear the music rising from them up the long, steady falling night, i turned the gas down, i got into bed, i said some words to the close and holy darkness, and then i slept,"

106,1,"or paintings on the backs of vests,"
107,1,"or sanskrit psalms on lepers' chests,"
108,1,but if this proved imposs-i-ble
109,1,"perhaps it would be just as well,"
110,1,"for you could then write what you please,"

112,1,

749,12,"who knew not sun nor moon by name,"
750,12,"felt thud beneath my flesh's armour,"
751,12,as yet was in a molten form
752,12,"the leaden stars, the rainy hammer"
753,12,"swung by my father from his dome,"
754,12,
755,12,"i knew the message of the winter,"
756,12,"the darted hail, the childish snow,"
757,12,and the wind was my sister suitor;
758,12,"wind in me leaped, the hellborn dew;"
759,12,my veins flowed with the eastern weather;
760,12,"ungotten i knew night and day,"
761,12,
762,12,"as yet ungotten, i did suffer;"
763,12,the rack of dreams my lily bones
764,12,"did twist into a living cipher,"
765,12,and flesh was snipped to cross the lines
766,12,of gallow crosses on the liver
767,12,"and brambles in the wringing brains,"
768,12,
769,12,my throat knew thirst before the structure
770,12,of skin and vein around the well
771,12,where words and water make a mixture
772,12,unfailing till the blood runs foul;
773,12,"my heart knew love, my belly hunger;"
774,12,"i smelt the maggot in my stool,"
775,12,
776,12,and time cast forth my mortal creature
777,12,to drift or drown upon the seas
778,12,acquainted with the salt adventure
779,12,"of tides that never touch the shores,"
780,12,i who was rich was made the richer
781,12,"by sipping at the vine of days,"
782,12,
783,12,"i, born of flesh and ghost, was neither"
784,12,"a ghost nor man, but mortal ghost,"
785,12,"and i was struck down by death's feather,"
786,12,i was a mortal to the last
787,12,long breath that carried to my father
788,12,"the message of his dying christ,"
789,12,
790,12,"you who bow down at cross and altar,"
791,12,remember me and pity him
792,12,who took my flesh and bone for armour
793,12,"and doublecrossed my mother's womb,"
794,13,my tears are like the quiet drift
795,13,of petals from some magic rose;
796,13,and all my grief flows from the rift
797,13,"of unremembered skies and snows,"
798,13,
799,13,"i think, that if i touched the earth,"
800,13,it would crumble;
801,13,"it is so sad and beautiful,"
802,13,"so tremulously like a dream,"
803,14,on almost the incendiary eve
804,14," of several near deaths,"
805,14,when one at the great least of your best loved
806,14, and always known must leave
807,14,"lions and fires of his flying breath,"
808,14, of your immortal friends
809,14,who'd raise the organs of the counted dust
810,14," to shoot and sing your praise,"
811,14,one who called deepest down shall hold his peace
812,14, that cannot sink or cease
813,14, endlessly to his wound
814,14,"in many married london's estranging grief,"
815,14,
816,14,on almost the incendiary eve
817,14," when at your lips and keys,"
818,14,"locking, unlocking, the murdered strangers weave,"
819,14," one who is most unknown,"
820,14,"your polestar neighbour, sun of another street,"
821,14," will dive up to his tears,"
822,14,he'll bathe his raining blood in the male sea
823,14, who strode for your own dead
824,14,and wind his globe out of your water thread
825,14, and load the throats of shells
826,14, with every cry since light
827,14,"flashed first across his thunderclapping eyes,"
828,14,
829,14,on almost the incendiary eve
830,14," of deaths and entrances,"
831,14,when near and strange wounded on london's waves
832,14," have sought your single grave,"
833,14,"one enemy, of many, who knows well"
834,14, your heart is luminous
835,14,"in the watched dark, quivering through locks and caves,"
836,14, will pull the thunderbolts
837,14,"to shut the sun, plunge, mount your darkened keys"
838,14," and sear just riders back,"
839,14, until that one loved least
840,14,"looms the last samson of your zodiac,"
841,15,"do not go gentle into that good night,"
842,15,old age should burn and rave at close of day;
843,15,"rage, rage against the dying of the light,"
844,15,
845,15,"though wise men at their end know dark is right,"
846,15,because their words had forked no lightning they
847,15,"do not go gentle into that good night,"
848,15,
849,15,"good men, the last wave by, crying how bright"
850,15,"their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,"
851,15,"rage, rage against the dying of the light,"
852,15,
853,15,"wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,"
854,15,"and learn, too late, they grieve it on its way,"
855,15,"do not go gentle into that good night,"
856,15,
857,15,"grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight"
858,15,"blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,"
859,15,"rage, rage against the dying of the light,"
860,15,
861,15,"and you, my father, there on the sad height,"
862,15,"curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, i pray,"
863,15,"do not go gentle into that good night,"
864,15,"rage, rage against the dying of the light,"
865,16,ears in the turrets hear
866,16,"hands grumble on the door,"
867,16,eyes in the gables see
868,16,"the fingers at the locks,"
869,16,shall i unbolt or stay
870,16,alone till the day i die
871,16,unseen by stranger-eyes
872,16,in this white house?
873,16,"hands, hold you poison or grapes?"
874,16,
875,16,beyond this island bound
876,16,by a thin sea of flesh
877,16,"and a bone coast,"
878,16,the land lies out of sound
879,16,"and the hills out of mind,"
880,16,no birds or flying fish
881,16,"disturbs this island's rest,"
882,16,
883,16,ears in this island hear
884,16,"the wind pass like a fire,"
885,16,eyes in this island see
886,16,"ships anchor off the bay,"
887,16,shall i run to the ships
888,16,"with the wind in my hair,"
889,16,or stay till the day i die
890,16,and welcome no sailor?
891,16,"ships, hold you poison or grapes?"

899,16,
900,16,"hands of the stranger and holds of the ships,"
901,16,hold you poison or grapes?
902,17,too proud to die; broken and blind he died
903,17,"the darkest way, and did not turn away,"
904,17,a cold kind man brave in his narrow pride
905,17,
906,17,"on that darkest day, oh, forever may"
907,17,"he lie lightly, at last, on the last, crossed"
908,17,"hill, under the grass, in love, and there grow"
909,17,
910,17,"young among the long flocks, and never lie lost"
911,17,"or still all the numberless days of his death, though"
912,17,above all he longed for his mother's breast
913,17,
914,17,"which was rest and dust, and in the kind ground"
915,17,"the darkest justice of death, blind and unblessed,"
916,17,"let him find no rest but be fathered and found,"
917,17,
918,17,"i prayed in the crouching room, by his blind bed,"
919,17,"in the muted house, one minute before"
920,17,"noon, and night, and light, the rivers of the dead"
921,17,
922,17,"veined his poor hand i held, and i saw"
923,17,"through his unseeing eyes to the roots of the sea,"
924,17,"an old tormented man three-quarters blind,"
925,17,
926,17,i am not too proud to cry that he and he
927,17,"will never never go out of my mind,"
928,17,"all his bones crying, and poor in all but pain,"
929,17,
930,17,"being innocent, he dreaded that he died"
931,17,"hating his god, but what he was was plain,"
932,17,"an old kind man brave in his burning pride,"
933,17,
934,17,"the sticks of the house were his; his books he owned,"
935,17,even as a baby he had never cried;
936,17,"nor did he now, save to his secret wound,"
937,17,
938,17,"out of his eyes i saw the last light glide,"
939,17,here among the light of the lording sky
940,17,an old man is with me where i go
941,17,
942,17,walking in the meadows of his son's eye
943,17,"on whom a world of ills came down like snow,"
944,17,"he cried as he died, fearing at last the spheres'"
945,17,
946,17,"last sound, the world going out without a breath,"
947,17,"too proud to cry, too frail to check the tears,"
948,17,"and caught between two nights, blindness and death,"
949,17,
950,17,o deepest wound of all that he should die
951,17,"on that darkest day, oh, he could hide"
952,17,"the tears out of his eyes, too proud to cry,"
953,17,
954,17,"until i die he will not leave my side,"
955,18,especially when the october wind
956,18,"with frosty fingers punishes my hair,"
957,18,caught by the crabbing sun i walk on fire
958,18,"and cast a shadow crab upon the land,"
959,18,"by the sea's side, hearing the noise of birds,"
960,18,"hearing the raven cough in winter sticks,"
961,18,my busy heart who shudders as she talks
962,18,"sheds the syllabic blood and drains her words,"
963,18,
964,18,"shut, too, in a tower of words, i mark"
965,18,on the horizon walking like the trees
966,18,"the wordy shapes of women, and the rows"
967,18,"of the star-gestured children in the park,"
968,18,"some let me make you of the vowelled beeches,"
969,18,"some of the oaken voices, from the roots"
970,18,"of many a thorny shire tell you notes,"
971,18,"some let me make you of the water's speeches,"
972,18,
973,18,behind a pot of ferns the wagging clock
974,18,"tells me the hour's word, the neural meaning"
975,18,"flies on the shafted disk, declaims the morning"
976,18,"and tells the windy weather in the cock,"
977,18,some let me make you of the meadow's signs;
978,18,the signal grass that tells me all i know
979,18,"breaks with the wormy winter through the eye,"
980,18,"some let me tell you of the raven's sins,"
981,18,
982,18,especially when the october wind
983,18,"some let me make you of autumnal spells,"
984,18,"the spider-tongued, and the loud hill of wales"
985,18,"with fists of turnips punishes the land,"
986,18,"some let me make you of the heartless words,"
987,18,"the heart is drained that, spelling in the scurry"
988,18,"of chemic blood, warned of the coming fury,"
989,18,"by the sea's side hear the dark-vowelled birds,"
990,19,now as i was young and easy under the apple boughs
991,19,"about the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,"
992,19,"the night above the dingle starry,"
993,19,time let me hail and climb
994,19,"golden in the heydays of his eyes,"
995,19,and honoured among wagons i was prince of the apple towns
996,19,and once below a time i lordly had the trees and leaves
997,19,trail with daisies and barley
998,19,"down the rivers of the windfall light,"
999,19,
1000,19,"and as i was green and carefree, famous among the barns"
1001,19,"about the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,"
1002,19,"in the sun that is young once only,"
1003,19,time let me play and be
1004,19,"golden in the mercy of his means,"
1005,19,"and green and golden i was huntsman and herdsman, the calves"
1006,19,"sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and"
1007,19,"cold,"
1008,19,and the sabbath rang slowly
1009,19,"in the pebbles of the holy streams,"
1010,19,
1011,19,"all the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay"
1012,19,"fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was"
1013,19,air
1014,19,"and playing, lovely and watery"
1015,19,"and fire green as grass,"
1016,19,and nightly under the simple stars
1017,19,"as i rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,"
1018,19,"all the moon long i heard, blessed among stables, the"
1019,19,nightjars
1020,19,"flying with the ricks, and the horses"
1021,19,"flashing into the dark,"
1022,19,
1023,19,"and then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white"
1024,19,"with the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder, it was all"
1025,19,"shining, it was adam and maiden,"
1026,19,the sky gathered again
1027,19,"and the sun grew round that very day,"
1028,19,so it must have been after the birth of the simple light
1029,19,"in the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking"
1030,19,warm
1031,19,out of the whinnying green stable
1032,19,"on to the fields of praise,"
1033,19,
1034,19,and honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house
1035,19,"under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,"
1036,19,"in the sun born over and over,"
1037,19,"i ran my heedless ways,"
1038,19,my wishes raced through the house high hay
1039,19,"and nothing i cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows"
1040,19,in all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs
1041,19,before the children green and golden
1042,19,"follow him out of grace,"
1043,19,
1044,19,"nothing i cared, in the lamb white days, that time would"
1045,19,take me
1046,19,"up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,"
1047,19,"in the moon that is always rising,"
1048,19,nor that riding to sleep
1049,19,i should hear him fly with the high fields
1050,19,"and wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land,"
1051,19,"oh as i was young and easy in the mercy of his means,"
1052,19,time held me green and dying
1053,19,"though i sang in my chains like the sea,"
1054,20,"foster the light nor veil the manshaped moon,"
1055,20,"nor weather winds that blow not down the bone,"
1056,20,but strip the twelve-winded marrow from his circle;
1057,20,master the night nor serve the snowman's brain
1058,20,that shapes each bushy item of the air
1059,20,"into a polestar pointed on an icicle,"
1060,20,
1061,20,"murmur of spring nor crush the cockerel's eggs,"
1062,20,"nor hammer back a season in the figs,"
1063,20,but graft these four-fruited ridings on your country;
1064,20,"farmer in time of frost the burning leagues,"
1065,20,"by red-eyed orchards sow the seeds of snow,"
1066,20,"in your young years the vegetable century,"
1067,20,
1068,20,"and father all nor fail the fly-lord's acre,"
1069,20,"nor sprout on owl-seed like a goblin-sucker,"
1070,20,but rail with your wizard's ribs the heart-shaped planet;
1071,20,"of mortal voices to the ninnies' choir,"
1072,20,"high lord esquire, speak up the singing cloud,"
1073,20,"and pluck a mandrake music from the marrowroot,"
1074,20,
1075,20,"roll unmanly over this turning tuft,"
1076,20,"o ring of seas, nor sorrow as i shift"
1077,20,from all my mortal lovers with a starboard smile;
1078,20,nor when my love lies in the cross-boned drift
1079,20,naked among the bow-and-arrow birds
1080,20,"shall you turn cockwise on a tufted axle,"
1081,20,
1082,20,"who gave these seas their colour in a shape,"
1083,20,"shaped my clayfellow, and the heaven's ark"
1084,20,in time at flood filled with his coloured doubles;
1085,20,"o who is glory in the shapeless maps,"
1086,20,now make the world of me as i have made
1087,20,"a merry manshape of your walking circle,"
1088,21,"from love's first fever to her plague, from the soft second"
1089,21,"and to the hollow minute of the womb,"
1090,21,"from the unfolding to the scissored caul,"
1091,21,the time for breast and the green apron age
1092,21,"when no mouth stirred about the hanging famine,"
1093,21,"all world was one, one windy nothing,"
1094,21,"my world was christened in a stream of milk,"
1095,21,"and earth and sky were as one airy hill,"
1096,21,"the sun and mood shed one white light,"
1097,21,
1098,21,"from the first print of the unshodden foot, the lifting"
1099,21,"hand, the breaking of the hair,"
1100,21,"from the first scent of the heart, the warning ghost,"
1101,21,"and to the first dumb wonder at the flesh,"
1102,21,"the sun was red, the moon was grey,"
1103,21,"the earth and sky were as two mountains meeting,"
1104,21,
1105,21,"the body prospered, teeth in the marrowed gums,"
1106,21,"the growing bones, the rumour of the manseed"
1107,21,"within the hallowed gland, blood blessed the heart,"
1108,21,"and the four winds, that had long blown as one,"
1109,21,"shone in my ears the light of sound,"
1110,21,"called in my eyes the sound of light,"
1111,21,"and yellow was the multiplying sand,"
1112,21,"each golden grain spat life into its fellow,"
1113,21,"green was the singing house,"
1114,21,
1115,21,"the plum my mother picked matured slowly,"
1116,21,the boy she dropped from darkness at her side
1117,21,"into the sided lap of light grew strong,"
1118,21,"was muscled, matted, wise to the crying thigh,"
1119,21,"and to the voice that, like a voice of hunger,"
1120,21,"itched in the noise of wind and sun,"
1121,21,
1122,21,and from the first declension of the flesh
1123,21,"i learnt man's tongue, to twist the shapes of thoughts"
1124,21,"into the stony idiom of the brain,"
1125,21,to shade and knit anew the patch of words
1126,21,"left by the dead who, in their moonless acre,"
1127,21,"need no word's warmth,"
1128,21,"the root of tongues ends in a spentout cancer,"
1129,21,"that but a name, where maggots have their x,"
1130,21,
1131,21,"i learnt the verbs of will, and had my secret;"
1132,21,the code of night tapped on my tongue;
1133,21,"what had been one was many sounding minded,"
1134,21,
1135,21,"one wound, one mind, spewed out the matter,"
1136,21,one breast gave suck the fever's issue;
1137,21,"from the divorcing sky i learnt the double,"
1138,21,the two-framed globe that spun into a score;
1139,21,a million minds gave suck to such a bud
1140,21,as forks my eye;
1141,21,youth did condense; the tears of spring
1142,21,dissolved in summer and the hundred seasons;
1143,21,"one sun, one manna, warmed and fed,"
1144,22,"hold hard, these ancient minutes in the cuckoo's month,"
1145,22,"under the lank, fourth folly on glamorgan's hill,"
1146,22,"as the green blooms ride upward, to the drive of time;"
1147,22,"time, in a folly's rider, like a county man"
1148,22,"over the vault of ridings with his hound at heel,"
1149,22,"drives forth my men, my children, from the hanging south,"
1150,22,
1151,22,"country, your sport is summer, and december's pools"
1152,22,by crane and water-tower by the seedy trees
1153,22,"lie this fifth month unstaked, and the birds have flown;"
1154,22,"holy hard, my country children in the world if tales,"
1155,22,"the greenwood dying as the deer fall in their tracks,"
1156,22,"the first and steepled season, to the summer's game,"
1157,22,
1158,22,"and now the horns of england, in the sound of shape,"
1159,22,"summon your snowy horsemen, and the four-stringed hill,"
1160,22,"over the sea-gut loudening, sets a rock alive;"
1161,22,"hurdles and guns and railings, as the boulders heave,"
1162,22,"crack like a spring in vice, bone breaking april,"
1163,22,"spill the lank folly's hunter and the hard-held hope,"
1164,22,
1165,22,"down fall four padding weathers on the scarlet lands,"
1166,22,"stalking my children's faces with a tail of blood,"
1167,22,"time, in a rider rising, from the harnessed valley;"

1242,24,"and dug your grave in my breast,"
1243,25,"i dreamed my genesis in sweat of sleep, breaking"
1244,25,"through the rotating shell, strong"
1245,25,"as motor muscle on the drill, driving"
1246,25,"through vision and the girdered nerve,"
1247,25,
1248,25,"from limbs that had the measure of the worm, shuffled"
1249,25,"off from the creasing flesh, filed"

1263,25,"sharp in my second death i marked the hills, harvest"

1275,25,"stale of adam's brine until, vision"
1276,25,"of new man strength, i seek the sun,"
1277,26,"i fellowed sleep who kissed me in the brain,"
1278,26,"let fall the tear of time; the sleeper's eye,"
1279,26,"shifting to light, turned on me like a moon,"
1280,26,"so, planning-heeled, i flew along my man"
1281,26,"and dropped on dreaming and the upward sky,"
1282,26,
1283,26,"i fled the earth and, naked, climbed the weather,"
1284,26,reaching a second ground far from the stars;
1285,26,"and there we wept i and a ghostly other,"
1286,26,"my mothers-eyed, upon the tops of trees;"
1287,26,"i fled that ground as lightly as a feather,"
1288,26,
1289,26,"'my fathers' globe knocks on its nave and sings,'"
1290,26,"'this that we tread was, too, your father's land,'"

1294,26,
1295,26,"faded my elbow ghost, the mothers-eyed,"
1296,26,"as, blowing on the angels, i was lost"
1297,26,on that cloud coast to each grave-grabbing shade;
1298,26,i blew the dreaming fellows to their bed
1299,26,"where still they sleep unknowing of their ghost,"
1300,26,
1301,26,then all the matter of the living air
1302,26,"raised up a voice, and, climbing on the words,"
1303,26,"i spelt my vision with a hand and hair,"
1304,26,"how light the sleeping on this soily star,"
1305,26,"how deep the waking in the worlded clouds,"
1306,26,

1310,26,"and old, mad man still climbing in his ghost,"
1311,26,"my fathers' ghost is climbing in the rain,"
1312,27,i have longed to move away
1313,27,from the hissing of the spent lie
1314,27,and the old terrors' continual cry
1315,27,growing more terrible as the day
1316,27,goes over the hill into the deep sea;
1317,27,i have longed to move away
1318,27,"from the repetition of salutes,"
1319,27,for there are ghosts in the air
1320,27,"and ghostly echoes on paper,"
1321,27,"and the thunder of calls and notes,"
1322,27,
1323,27,i have longed to move away but am afraid;
1324,27,"some life, yet unspent, might explode"
1325,27,"out of the old lie burning on the ground,"
1326,27,"and, crackling into the air, leave me half-blind,"
1327,27,"neither by night's ancient fear,"
1328,27,"the parting of hat from hair,"
1329,27,"pursed lips at the receiver,"
1330,27,"shall i fall to death's feather,"
1331,27,"by these i would not care to die,"
1332,27,"half convention and half lie,"
1333,28,i
1334,28,
1335,28,i see the boys of summer in their ruin
1336,28,"lay the gold tithings barren,"
1337,28,"setting no store by harvest, freeze the soils;"
1338,28,there in their heat the winter floods
1339,28,"of frozen loves they fetch their girls,"
1340,28,"and drown the cargoed apples in their tides,"
1341,28,
1342,28,"these boys of light are curdlers in their folly,"
1343,28,sour the boiling honey;
1344,28,the jacks of frost they finger in the hives;
1345,28,there in the sun the frigid threads
1346,28,of doubt and dark they feed their nerves;
1347,28,"the signal moon is zero in their voids,"
1348,28,
1349,28,i see the summer children in their mothers
1350,28,"split up the brawned womb's weathers,"
1351,28,divide the night and day with fairy thumbs;
1352,28,there in the deep with quartered shades
1353,28,of sun and moon they paint their dams
1354,28,"as sunlight paints the shelling of their heads,"
1355,28,
1356,28,i see that from these boys shall men of nothing
1357,28,"stature by seedy shifting,"
1358,28,or lame the air with leaping from its hearts;
1359,28,there from their hearts the dogdayed pulse
1360,28,"of love and light bursts in their throats,"
1361,28,"o see the pulse of summer in the ice,"
1362,28,
1363,28,ii
1364,28,
1365,28,but seasons must be challenged or they totter
1366,28,into a chiming quarter
1367,28,"where, punctual as death, we ring the stars;"
1368,28,"there, in his night, the black-tongued bells"
1369,28,"the sleepy man of winter pulls,"

1373,28,"death from a summer woman,"
1374,28,"a muscling life from lovers in their cramp,"
1375,28,from the fair dead who flush the sea
1376,28,"the bright-eyed worm on davy's lamp,"
1377,28,"and from the planted womb the man of straw,"

1382,28,pick the world's ball of wave and froth
1383,28,"to choke the deserts with her tides,"

1577,30,"of lover, mother, lovers, or his six"
1578,30,"feet in the rubbing dust,"
1579,30,
1580,30,and what's the rub?  death's feather on the nerve?
1581,30,"your mouth, my love, the thistle in the kiss?"
1582,30,my jack of christ born thorny on the tree?
1583,30,"the words of death are dryer than his stiff,"
1584,30,"my wordy wounds are printed with your hair,"
1585,30,"i would be tickled by the rub that is,"
1586,30,"man be my metaphor,"
1587,31,in my craft or sullen art
1588,31,exercised in the still night
1589,31,when only the moon rages
1590,31,and the lovers lie abed
1591,31,with all their griefs in their arms
1592,31,i labour by singing light
1593,31,not for ambition or bread
1594,31,or the strut and trade of charms
1595,31,on the ivory stages
1596,31,but for the common wages
1597,31,"of their most secret heart,"
1598,31,
1599,31,not for the proud man apart
1600,31,from the raging moon i write
1601,31,on these spindrift pages
1602,31,nor for the towering dead
1603,31,with their nightingales and psalms
1604,31,"but for the lovers, their arms"
1605,31,"round the griefs of the ages,"
1606,31,who pay no praise or wages
1607,31,"nor heed my craft or art,"
1608,32,"in the beginning was the three-pointed star,"
1609,32,"one smile of light across the empty face,"
1610,32,"one bough of bone across the rooting air,"
1611,32,"the substance forked that marrowed the first sun,"
1612,32,"and, burning ciphers on the round of space,"
1613,32,"heaven and hell mixed as they spun,"
1614,32,
1615,32,"in the beginning was the pale signature,"
1616,32,"three-syllabled and starry as the smile,"
1617,32,"and after came the imprints on the water,"
1618,32,stamp of the minted face upon the moon;
1619,32,the blood that touched the crosstree and the grail
1620,32,"touched the first cloud and left a sign,"
1621,32,
1622,32,in the beginning was the mounting fire
1623,32,"that set alight the weathers from a spark,"
1624,32,"a three-eyed, red-eyed spark, blunt as a flower,"
1625,32,"life rose and spouted from the rolling seas,"
1626,32,"burst in the roots, pumped from the earth and rock"
1627,32,"the secret oils that drive the grass,"
1628,32,
1629,32,"in the beginning was the word, the word"
1630,32,that from the solid bases of the light
1631,32,abstracted all the letters of the void;
1632,32,and from the cloudy bases of the breath
1633,32,"the word flowed up, translating to the heart"
1634,32,"first characters of birth and death,"
1635,32,
1636,32,"in the beginning was the secret brain,"
1637,32,the brain was celled and soldered in the thought
1638,32,before the pitch was forking to a sun;
1639,32,"before the veins were shaking in their sieve,"
1640,32,blood shot and scattered to the winds of light
1641,32,"the ribbed original of love,"
1642,33,"incarnate devil in a talking snake,"
1643,33,"the central plains of asia in his garden,"
1644,33,"in shaping-time the circle stung awake,"
1645,33,"in shapes of sin forked out the bearded apple,"
1646,33,and god walked there who was a fiddling warden
1647,33,"and played down pardon from the heavens' hill,"
1648,33,
1649,33,"when we were strangers to the guided seas,"
1650,33,"a handmade moon half holy in a cloud,"
1651,33,the wisemen tell me that the garden gods
1652,33,twined good and evil on an eastern tree;
1653,33,and when the moon rose windily it was
1654,33,"black as the beast and paler than the cross,"
1655,33,
1656,33,we in our eden knew the secret guardian
1657,33,"in sacred waters that no frost could harden,"
1658,33,and in the mighty mornings of the earth;
1659,33,"hell in a horn of sulphur and the cloven myth,"
1660,33,"all heaven in the midnight of the sun,"
1661,33,"a serpent fiddled in the shaping-time,"
1662,34,"because the pleasure-bird whistles after the hot wires,"
1663,34,shall the blind horse sing sweeter?
1664,34,convenient bird and beast lie lodged to suffer
1665,34,"the supper and knives of a mood,"
1666,34,in the sniffed and poured snow on the tip of the tongue of the year
1667,34,"that clouts the spittle like bubbles with broken rooms,"
1668,34,"an enamoured man alone by the twigs of his eyes, two fires,"
1669,34,"camped in the drug-white shower of nerves and food,"
1670,34,savours the lick of the times through a deadly wood of hair
1671,34,"in a wind that plucked a goose,"
1672,34,"nor ever, as the wild tongue breaks its tombs,"
1673,34,"rounds to look at the red, wagged root,"
1674,34,"because there stands, one story out of the bum city,"
1675,34,that frozen wife whose juices drift like a fixed sea
1676,34,"secretly in statuary,"
1677,34,"shall i, struck on the hot and rocking street,"
1678,34,not spin to stare at an old year
1679,34,toppling and burning in the muddle of towers and galleries
1680,34,like the mauled pictures of boys?
1681,34,the salt person and blasted place
1682,34,"i furnish with the meat of a fable,"
1683,34,"if the dead starve, their stomachs turn to tumble"
1684,34,an upright man in the antipodes
1685,34,"or spray-based and rock-chested sea,"
1686,34,"over the past table i repeat this present grace,"
1687,35,when i was a windy boy and a bit
1688,35,"and the black spit of the chapel fold,"
1689,35,"sighed the old ram rod, dying of women,"
1690,35,"i tiptoed shy in the gooseberry wood,"
1691,35,"the rude owl cried like a tell-tale tit,"
1692,35,i skipped in a blush as the big girls rolled
1693,35,"nine-pin down on donkey's common,"
1694,35,and on seesaw sunday nights i wooed
1695,35,"whoever i would with my wicked eyes,"
1696,35,the whole of the moon i could love and leave
1697,35,all the green leaved little weddings' wives
1698,35,"in the coal black bush and let them grieve,"
1699,35,
1700,35,when i was a gusty man and a half
1701,35,and the black beast of the beetles' pews
1702,35,"sighed the old ram rod, dying of bitches,"
1703,35,not a boy and a bit in the wick-
1704,35,"dipping moon and drunk as a new dropped calf,"
1705,35,"i whistled all night in the twisted flues,"
1706,35,"midwives grew in the midnight ditches,"
1707,35,"and the sizzling sheets of the town cried, quick!-"
1708,35,"whenever i dove in a breast high shoal,"
1709,35,"wherever i ramped in the clover quilts,"
1710,35,whatsoever i did in the coal-
1711,35,"black night, i left my quivering prints,"
1712,35,
1713,35,when i was a man you could call a man
1714,35,"and the black cross of the holy house,"
1715,35,"sighed the old ram rod, dying of welcome,"
1716,35,"brandy and ripe in my bright, bass prime,"
1717,35,no springtailed tom in the red hot town
1718,35,with every simmering woman his mouse
1719,35,but a hillocky bull in the swelter
1720,35,of summer come in his great good time
1721,35,"to the sultry, biding herds, i said,"
1722,35,"oh, time enough when the blood runs cold,"
1723,35,"and i lie down but to sleep in bed,"
1724,35,"for my sulking, skulking, coal black soul!"
1725,35,
1726,35,when i was half the man i was
1727,35,"and serve me right as the preachers warn,"
1728,35,"sighed the old ram rod, dying of downfall,"
1729,35,no flailing calf or cat in a flame
1730,35,or hickory bull in milky grass
1731,35,"but a black sheep with a crumpled horn,"
1732,35,at last the soul from its foul mousehole
1733,35,slunk pouting out when the limp time came;
1734,35,"and i gave my soul a blind, slashed eye,"
1735,35,"gristle and rind, and a roarers' life,"
1736,35,and i shoved it into the coal black sky
1737,35,"to find a woman's soul for a wife,"
1738,35,
1739,35,now i am a man no more no more
1740,35,"and a black reward for a roaring life,"
1741,35,"sighed the old ram rod, dying of strangers,"
1742,35,tidy and cursed in my dove cooed room
1743,35,i lie down thin and hear the good bells jaw--
1744,35,"for, oh, my soul found a sunday wife"
1745,35,in the coal black sky and she bore angels!
1746,35,harpies around me out of her womb!
1747,35,"chastity prays for me, piety sings,"
1748,35,"innocence sweetens my last black breath,"
1749,35,"modesty hides my thighs in her wings,"
1750,35,and all the deadly virtues plague my death!
1751,36,"lie still, sleep becalmed, sufferer with the wound"
1752,36,"in the throat, burning and turning, all night afloat"
1753,36,on the silent sea we have heard the sound
1754,36,"that came from the wound wrapped in the salt sheet,"
1755,36,
1756,36,under the mile off moon we trembled listening
1757,36,to the sea sound flowing like blood from the loud wound
1758,36,and when the salt sheet broke in a storm of singing
1759,36,"the voices of all the drowned swam on the wind,"
1760,36,
1761,36,"open a pathway through the slow sad sail,"
1762,36,throw wide to the wind the gates of the wandering boat
1763,36,"for my voyage to begin to the end of my wound,"
1764,36,"we heard the sea sound sing, we saw the salt sheet tell,"
1765,36,"lie still, sleep becalmed, hide the mouth in the throat,"
1766,36,"or we shall obey, and ride with you through the drowned,"
1767,37,light breaks where no sun shines;
1768,37,"where no sea runs, the waters of the heart"
1769,37,push in their tides;
1770,37,"and, broken ghosts with glowworms in their heads,"
1771,37,the things of light
1772,37,"file through the flesh where no flesh decks the bones,"
1773,37,
1774,37,a candle in the thighs
1775,37,warms youth and seed and burns the seeds of age;
1776,37,"where no seed stirs,"
1777,37,"the fruit of man unwrinkles in the stars,"
1778,37,bright as a fig;
1779,37,"where no wax is, the candle shows its hairs,"
1780,37,
1781,37,dawn breaks behind the eyes;
1782,37,from poles of skull and toe the windy blood
1783,37,slides like a sea;
1784,37,"nor fenced, nor staked, the gushers of the sky"
1785,37,spout to the rod
1786,37,"divining in a smile the oil of tears,"
1787,37,
1788,37,"night in the sockets rounds,"
1789,37,"like some pitch moon, the limit of the globes;"
1790,37,day lights the bone;
1791,37,"where no cold is, the skinning gales unpin"
1792,37,the winter's robes;
1793,37,"the film of spring is hanging from the lids,"
1794,37,
1795,37,"light breaks on secret lots,"
1796,37,on tips of thought where thoughts smell in the rain;
1797,37,"when logics die,"
1798,37,"the secret of the soil grows through the eye,"
1799,37,and blood jumps in the sun;
1800,37,"above the waste allotments the dawn halts,"
1801,38,a stranger has come
1802,38,"to share my room in the house not right in the head,"
1803,38,a girl mad as birds
1804,38,
1805,38,"bolting the night of the door with her arm her plume,"
1806,38,strait in the mazed bed
1807,38,she deludes the heaven-proof house with entering clouds
1808,38,
1809,38,"yet she deludes with walking the nightmarish room,"
1810,38,"at large as the dead,"
1811,38,"or rides the imagined oceans of the male wards,"
1812,38,
1813,38,she has come possessed
1814,38,"who admits the delusive light through the bouncing wall,"
1815,38,possessed by the skies
1816,38,
1817,38,she sleeps in the narrow trough yet she walks the dust
1818,38,yet raves at her will
1819,38,"on the madhouse boards worn thin by my walking tears,"
1820,38,
1821,38,and taken by light in her arms at long and dear last
1822,38,i may without fail
1823,38,"suffer the first vision that set fire to the stars,"
1824,39,my hero bares his nerves along my wrist
1825,39,"that rules from wrist to shoulder,"
1826,39,"unpacks the head that, like a sleepy ghost,"
1827,39,"leans on my mortal ruler,"
1828,39,"the proud spine spurning turn and twist,"
1829,39,
1830,39,and these poor nerves so wired to the skull
1831,39,ache on the lovelorn paper
1832,39,i hug to love with my unruly scrawl
1833,39,that utters all love hunger
1834,39,"and tells the page the empty ill,"
1835,39,
1836,39,my hero bares my side and sees his heart
1837,39,"tread; like a naked venus,"
1838,39,"the beach of flesh, and wind her bloodred plait;"
1839,39,"stripping my loin of promise,"
1840,39,"he promises a secret heat,"
1841,39,
1842,39,he holds the wire from this box of nerves
1843,39,praising the mortal error
1844,39,"of birth and death, the two sad knaves of thieves,"
1845,39,and the hunger's emperor;
1846,39,"he pulls that chain, the cistern moves,"
1847,40,i
1848,40,
1849,40,half of the fellow father as he doubles
1850,40,"his sea-sucked adam in the hollow hulk,"
1851,40,half of the fellow mother as she dabbles
1852,40,"to-morrow's diver in her horny milk,"
1853,40,bisected shadows on the thunder's bone
1854,40,"bolt for the salt unborn,"
1855,40,
1856,40,the fellow half was frozen as it bubbled
1857,40,"corrosive spring out of the iceberg's crop,"
1858,40,the fellow seed and shadow as it babbled
1859,40,"the swing of milk was tufted in the pap,"
1860,40,"for half of love was planted in the lost,"
1861,40,"and the unplanted ghost,"
1862,40,
1863,40,"the broken halves are fellowed in a cripple,"
1864,40,"the crutch that marrow taps upon their sleep,"
1865,40,"limp in the street of sea, among the rabble"
1866,40,"of tide-tongued heads and bladders in the deep,"
1867,40,and stake the sleepers in the savage grave
1868,40,"that the vampire laugh,"
1869,40,
1870,40,the patchwork halves were cloven as they scudded
1871,40,"the wild pigs' wood, and slime upon the trees,"
1872,40,"sucking the dark, kissed on the cyanide,"
1873,40,"and loosed the braiding adders from their hairs,"
1874,40,rotating halves are horning as they drill
1875,40,"the arterial angel,"
1876,40,
1877,40,what colour is glory? death's feather? tremble
1878,40,"the halves that pierce the pin's point in the air,"
1879,40,"and prick the thumb-stained heaven through the thimble,"
1880,40,"the ghost is dumb that stammered in the straw,"
1881,40,the ghost that hatched his havoc as he flew
1882,40,"blinds their cloud-tracking eye,"
1883,40,
1884,40,ii
1885,40,
1886,40,"my world is pyramid, the padded mummer"
1887,40,weeps on the desert ochre and the salt
1888,40,"incising summer,"
1889,40,"my egypt's armour buckling in its sheet,"
1890,40,i scrape through resin to a starry bone
1891,40,"and a blood parhelion,"
1892,40,
1893,40,"my world is cypress, and an english valley,"
1894,40,i piece my flesh that rattled on the yards
1895,40,"red in an austrian volley,"
1896,40,"i hear, through dead men's drums, the riddled lads,"
1897,40,"screwing their bowels from a hill of bones,"
1898,40,"cry eloi to the guns,"
1899,40,
1900,40,"my grave is watered by the crossing jordan,"
1901,40,"the arctic scut, and basin of the south,"
1902,40,"drip on my dead house garden,"
1903,40,"who seek me landward, marking in my mouth"
1904,40,"the straws of asia, lose me as i turn"
1905,40,"through the atlantic corn,"
1906,40,
1907,40,"the fellow halves that, cloven as they swivel"
1908,40,"on casting tides, are tangled in the shells,"
1909,40,"bearding the unborn devil,"
1910,40,"bleed from my burning fork and smell my heels,"

1912,40,"binding my angel's hood,"
1913,40,
1914,40,who blows death's feather? what glory is colour?
1915,40,"i blow the stammel feather in the vein,"

1925,41,and bear those tendril hands i touch across
1926,41,"the agonized, two seas,"
1927,41,behind my head a square of sky sags over
1928,41,the circular smile tossed from lover to lover
1929,41,and the golden ball spins out of the skies;
1930,41,not from this anger after
1931,41,refusal struck like a bell under water

1987,44,who moved for three years in tune
1988,44,"down the long walks of their vows,"
1989,44,
1990,44,now their love lies a loss
1991,44,and love and his patients roar on a chain;
1992,44,from every tune or crater
1993,44,"carrying cloud, death strikes their house,"
1994,44,
1995,44,too late in the wrong rain
1996,44,"they come together whom their love parted,"
1997,44,the windows pour into their heart
1998,44,"and the doors burn in their brain,"
1999,45,on no work of words now for three lean months in the
2000,45,bloody
2001,45,belly of the rich year and the big purse of my body
2002,45,"i bitterly take to task my poverty and craft,"
2003,45,
2004,45,"to take to give is all, return what is hungrily given"
2005,45,"puffing the pounds of manna up through the dew to heaven,"
2006,45,"the lovely gift of the gab bangs back on a blind shaft,"
2007,45,
2008,45,to lift to leave from treasures of man is pleasing death
2009,45,that will rake at last all currencies of the marked breath
2010,45,"and count the taken, forsaken mysteries in a bad dark,"
2011,45,
2012,45,"to surrender now is to pay the expensive ogre twice,"
2013,45,"ancient woods of my blood, dash down to the nut of the seas"
2014,45,if i take to burn or return this world which is each man's
2015,45,"work,"
2016,46,once it was the colour of saying
2017,46,soaked my table the uglier side of a hill
2018,46,with a capsized field where a school sat still
2019,46,and a black and white patch of girls grew playing;
2020,46,the gentle seaslides of saying i must undo
2021,46,"that all the charmingly drowned arise to cockcrow and kill,"
2022,46,when i whistled with mitching boys through a reservoir park
2023,46,where at night we stoned the cold and cuckoo
2024,46,"lovers in the dirt of their leafy beds,"
2025,46,the shade of their trees was a word of many shades
2026,46,and a lamp of lightning for the poor in the dark;
2027,46,"now my saying shall be my undoing,"
2028,46,"and every stone i wind off like a reel,"
2029,47,i
2030,47,
2031,47,"our eunuch dreams, all seedless in the light,"
2032,47,"of light and love the tempers of the heart,"
2033,47,"whack their boys' limbs,"
2034,47,"and, winding-footed in their shawl and sheet,"
2035,47,"groom the dark brides, the widows of the night"
2036,47,"fold in their arms,"
2037,47,
2038,47,"the shades of girls, all flavoured from their shrouds,"
2039,47,"when sunlight goes are sundered from the worm,"
2040,47,"the bones of men, the broken in their beds,"
2041,47,"by midnight pulleys that unhouse the tomb,"
2042,47,
2043,47,ii
2044,47,
2045,47,in this our age the gunman and his moll
2046,47,"two one-dimensional ghosts, love on a reel,"
2047,47,"strange to our solid eye,"
2048,47,and speak their midnight nothings as they swell;
2049,47,when cameras shut they hurry to their hole
2050,47,"down in the yard of day,"
2051,47,
2052,47,"they dance between their arclamps and our skull,"
2053,47,"impose their shots, showing the nights away;"
2054,47,we watch the show of shadows kiss or kill
2055,47,"flavoured of celluloid give love the lie,"
2056,47,
2057,47,iii
2058,47,
2059,47,"which is the world?  of our two sleepings, which"
2060,47,shall fall awake when cures and their itch
2061,47,raise up this red-eyed earth?
2062,47,"pack off the shapes of daylight and their starch,"
2063,47,"the sunny gentlemen, the welshing rich,"
2064,47,"or drive the night-geared forth,"
2065,47,
2066,47,"the photograph is married to the eye,"
2067,47,grafts on its bride one-sided skins of truth;
2068,47,the dream has sucked the sleeper of his faith
2069,47,"that shrouded men might marrow as they fly,"
2070,47,
2071,47,iv
2072,47,
2073,47,this is the world; the lying likeness of
2074,47,our strips of stuff that tatter as we move
2075,47,loving and being loth;
2076,47,the dream that kicks the buried from their sack
2077,47,"and lets their trash be honoured as the quick,"
2078,47,"this is the world,  have faith,"
2079,47,
2080,47,"for we shall be a shouter like the cock,"
2081,47,blowing the old dead back; our shots shall smack
2082,47,the image from the plates;
2083,47,"and we shall be fit fellows for a life,"
2084,47,"and who remains shall flower as they love,"
2085,47,"praise to our faring hearts,"
2086,48,it was my thirtieth year to heaven
2087,48,woke to my hearing from harbour and neighbour wood
2088,48,   and the mussel pooled and the heron
2089,48,           priested shore
2090,48,       the morning beckon
2091,48,with water praying and call of seagull and rook
2092,48,and the knock of sailing boats on the net webbed wall
2093,48,       myself to set foot
2094,48,           that second
2095,48,"in the still sleeping town and set forth,"
2096,48,
2097,48,   my birthday began with the water-
2098,48,birds and the birds of the winged trees flying my name
2099,48,   above the farms and the white horses
2100,48,           and i rose
2101,48,       in rainy autumn
2102,48,"and walked abroad in a shower of all my days,"
2103,48,high tide and the heron dived when i took the road
2104,48,       over the border
2105,48,           and the gates
2106,48,"of the town closed as the town awoke,"
2107,48,
2108,48,   a springful of larks in a rolling
2109,48,cloud and the roadside bushes brimming with whistling
2110,48,   blackbirds and the sun of october
2111,48,           summery
2112,48,"       on the hill's shoulder,"
2113,48,here were fond climates and sweet singers suddenly
2114,48,come in the morning where i wandered and listened
2115,48,       to the rain wringing
2116,48,           wind blow cold
2117,48,"in the wood faraway under me,"
2118,48,
2119,48,   pale rain over the dwindling harbour
2120,48,and over the sea wet church the size of a snail
2121,48,   with its horns through mist and the castle
2122,48,           brown as owls
2123,48,       but all the gardens
2124,48,of spring and summer were blooming in the tall tales
2125,48,"beyond the border and under the lark full cloud,"
2126,48,       there could i marvel
2127,48,           my birthday
2128,48,"away but the weather turned around,"
2129,48,
2130,48,   it turned away from the blithe country
2131,48,and down the other air and the blue altered sky
2132,48,   streamed again a wonder of summer
2133,48,           with apples
2134,48,       pears and red currants
2135,48,and i saw in the turning so clearly a child's
2136,48,forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother
2137,48,       through the parables
2138,48,           of sun light
2139,48,and the legends of the green chapels
2140,48,
2141,48,   and the twice told fields of infancy
2142,48,"that his tears burned my cheeks and his heart moved in mine,"
2143,48,   these were the woods the river and sea
2144,48,           where a boy
2145,48,       in the listening
2146,48,summertime of the dead whispered the truth of his joy
2147,48,"to the trees and the stones and the fish in the tide,"
2148,48,       and the mystery
2149,48,           sang alive
2150,48,"still in the water and singingbirds,"
2151,48,
2152,48,   and there could i marvel my birthday
2153,48,"away but the weather turned around, and the true"
2154,48,   joy of the long dead child sang burning
2155,48,"           in the sun,"
2156,48,       it was my thirtieth
2157,48,year to heaven stood there then in the summer noon
2158,48,"though the town below lay leaved with october blood,"
2159,48,       o may my heart's truth
2160,48,           still be sung
2161,48,"on this high hill in a year's turning,"
2162,49,"in the mustardseed sun,"
2163,49,by full tilt river and switchback sea
2164,49," where the cormorants scud,"
2165,49,in his house on stilts high among beaks
2166,49, and palavers of birds
2167,49,this sandgrain day in the bent bay's grave
2168,49, he celebrates and spurns
2169,49,his driftwood thirty-fifth wind turned age;
2170,49," herons spire and spear,"
2171,49,
2172,49, under and round him go
2173,49,"flounders, gulls, on their cold, dying trails,"
2174,49," doing what they are told,"
2175,49,curlews aloud in the congered waves
2176,49," work at their ways to death,"
2177,49,"and the rhymer in the long tongued room,"
2178,49," who tolls his birthday bell,"
2179,49,toesl towards the ambush of his wounds;
2180,49," herons, stepple stemmed, bless,"
2181,49,
2182,49," in the thistledown fall,"
2183,49,he sings towards anguish; finches fly
2184,49, in the claw tracks of hawks
2185,49,on a seizing sky; small fishes glide
2186,49, through wynds and shells of drowned
2187,49,"ship towns to pastures of otters, he"
2188,49," in his slant, racking house"
2189,49,and the hewn coils of his trade perceives
2190,49," herons walk in their shroud,"
2191,49,
2192,49, the livelong river's robe
2193,49,of minnows wreathing around their prayer;
2194,49," and far at sea he knows,"
2195,49,"who slaves to his crouched, eternal end"
2196,49," under a serpent cloud,"
2197,49,"dolphins dyive in their turnturtle dust,"
2198,49, the rippled seals streak down
2199,49,to kill and their own tide daubing blood
2200,49," slides good in the sleek mouth,"
2201,49,
2202,49," in a cavernous, swung"
2203,49,"wave's silence, wept white angelus knells,"
2204,49, thirty-five bells sing struck
2205,49,"on skull and scar where his lovews lie wrecked,"
2206,49," steered by the falling stars,"
2207,49,and to-morrow weeps in a blind cage
2208,49, terror will rage apart
2209,49,before chains break to a hammer flame
2210,49, and love unbolts the dark
2211,49,
2212,49, and freely he goes lost
2213,49,"in the unknown, famous light of great"
2214,49," and fabulous, dear god,"
2215,49,"dark is a way and light is a place,"
2216,49, heaven that never was
2217,49,"nor will be ever is always true,"
2218,49," and, in that brambled void,"
2219,49,plenty as blackberries in the woods
2220,49," the dead grow for his joy,"
2221,49,
2222,49, there he might wander bare
2223,49,with the spirits of the horseshoe bay
2224,49," or the stars' seashore dead,"
2225,49,"marrow of eagles, the roots of whales"
2226,49," and wishbones of wild geese,"
2227,49,"with blessed, unborn god and his ghost,"
2228,49," and every soul his priest,"
2229,49,gulled and chanter in young heaven's fold
2230,49," be at cloud quaking peace,"
2231,49,
2232,49," but dark is a long way,"
2233,49,"he, on the earth of the night, alone"
2234,49," with all the living, prays,"
2235,49,who knows the rocketing wind will blow
2236,49," the bones out of the hills,"
2237,49,"and the scythed boulders bleed, and the last"
2238,49, rage shattered waters kick
2239,49,"masts and fishes to the still quick starts,"
2240,49, faithlessly unto him
2241,49,
2242,49, who is the light of old
2243,49,and air shaped heaven where souls grow wild
2244,49," as horses in the foam,"
2245,49,"oh, let me midlife mourn by the shrined"
2246,49, and druid herons' vows
2247,49,"the voyage to ruin i must run,"
2248,49," dawn ships clouted aground,"
2249,49,"yet, though i cry with tumbledown tongue,"
2250,49," count my blessings aloud,"
2251,49,
2252,49, four elements and five
2253,49,"senses, and man a spirit in love"
2254,49, thangling through this spun slime
2255,49,to his nimbus bell cool kingdom come
2256,49," and the lost, moonshine domes,"
2257,49,and the sea that hides his secret selves
2258,49," deep in its black, base bones,"
2259,49,"lulling of spheres in the seashell flesh,"
2260,49," and this last blessing most,"
2261,49,
2262,49, that the closer i move
2263,49,"to death, one man through his sundered hulks,"
2264,49, the louder the sun blooms
2265,49,"and the tusked, ramshackling sea exults;"
2266,49, and every wave of the way
2267,49,"and gale i tackle, the whole world then,"
2268,49, with more triumphant faith
2269,49,"that ever was since the world was said,"
2270,49," spins its morning of praise,"
2271,49,
2272,49, i hear the bouncing hills
2273,49,grow larked and greener at berry brown
2274,49, fall and the dew larks sing
2275,49,"taller this thunderclap spring, and how"
2276,49,  more spanned with angles ride
2277,49,"the mansouled fiery islands! oh,"
2278,49," holier then their eyes,"
2279,49,and my shining men no more alone
2280,49, as i sail out to die
2281,50,this day winding down now
2282,50,at god speeded summer's end
2283,50,"in the torrent salmon sun,"
2284,50,in my seashaken house
2285,50,on a breakneck of rocks
2286,50,"tangled with chirrup and fruit,"
2287,50,"froth, flute, fin, and quill"
2288,50,"at a wood's dancing hoof,"
2289,50,"by scummed, starfish sands"
2290,50,with their fishwife cross
2291,50,"gulls, pipers, cockles, and snails,"
2292,50,"out there, crow black, men"
2293,50,"tackled with clouds, who kneel"
2294,50,"to the sunset nets,"
2295,50,"geese nearly in heaven, boys"
2296,50,"stabbing, and herons, and shells"
2297,50,"that speak seven seas,"
2298,50,eternal waters away
2299,50,from the cities of nine
2300,50,days' night whose towers will catch
2301,50,in the religious wind
2302,50,"like stalks of tall, dry straw,"
2303,50,at poor peace i sing
2304,50,to you strangers though song
2305,50,"is a burning and crested act,"
2306,50,the fire of birds in
2307,50,"the world's turning wood,"
2308,50,"for my swan, splay sounds,"
2309,50,out of these seathumbed leaves
2310,50,that will fly and fall
2311,50,like leaves of trees and as soon
2312,50,crumble and undie
2313,50,"into the dogdayed night,"
2314,50,"seaward the salmon, sucked sun slips,"
2315,50,and the dumb swans drub blue
2316,50,"my dabbed bay's dusk, as i hack"
2317,50,this rumpus of shapes
2318,50,for you to know
2319,50,"how i, a spining man,"
2320,50,"glory also this star, bird"
2321,50,"roared, sea born, man torn, blood blest,"
2322,50,"hark, i trumpet the place,"
2323,50,"from fish to jumping hill! look,"
2324,50,i build my bellowing ark
2325,50,to the best of my love
2326,50,"as the flood begins,"
2327,50,out of the fountainhead
2328,50,"of fear, rage read, manalive,"
2329,50,molten and mountainous to stream
2330,50,over the wound asleep
2331,50,sheep white hollow farms
2332,50,
2333,50,"to wales in my arms,"
2334,50,"hoo, there, in castle keep,"
2335,50,"you king singsong owls, who moonbeam"
2336,50,the flickering runs and dive
2337,50,the dingle furred deer dead!
2338,50,"huloo, on plumbed bryns,"
2339,50,o my ruffled ring dove
2340,50,"in the hooting, nearly dark"
2341,50,"with welsh and reverent rook,"
2342,50,"coo rooning the woods' praise,"
2343,50,who moons her blue notes from her nest
2344,50,down to the curlew herd!
2345,50,"ho, hullaballoing clan"
2346,50,"agape, with woe"
2347,50,"in your beaks, on the gabbing capes!"
2348,50,"heigh, on horseback hill, jack"
2349,50,whisking hare! who
2350,50,"hears, there, this fox light, my flood ship's"
2351,50,clangour as i hew and smite
2352,50,a clash of anvils for my
2353,50,"hubbub and fiddle, this tune"
2354,50,on a tongued puffball
2355,50,but animals thick as thieves
2356,50,on god's rough tumbling grounds
2357,50,"hail to his beasthood!,"
2358,50,"beasts who sleep good and thin,"
2359,50,"hist, in hogback woods! the haystacked"
2360,50,hollow farms in a throng
2361,50,"of waters cluck and cling,"
2362,50,and barnroofs cockcrow war!
2363,50,o kingdom of neighbors finned
2364,50,"felled and quilled, flash to my patch"
2365,50,work ark and the moonshine
2366,50,"drinking noah of the bay,"
2367,50,"with pelt, and scale, and fleece,"
2368,50,only the drowned deep bells
2369,50,of sheep and churches noise
2370,50,poor peace as the sun sets
2371,50,"and dark shoals every holy field,"
2372,50,"we will ride out alone then,"
2373,50,"under the stars of wales,"
2374,50,"cry, multitudes of arks! across"
2375,50,"the water lidded lands,"
2376,50,manned with their loves they'll move

2384,51,"should lanterns shine, the holy face,"
2385,51,"caught in an octagon of unaccustomed light,"
2386,51,"would wither up, an any boy of love"
2387,51,"look twice before he fell from grace,"
2388,51,the features in their private dark
2389,51,"are formed of flesh, but let the false day come"
2390,51,"and from her lips the faded pigments fall,"
2391,51,"the mummy cloths expose an ancient breast,"
2392,51,
2393,51,"i have been told to reason by the heart,"
2394,51,"but heart, like head, leads helplessly;"
2395,51,"i have been told to reason by the pulse,"
2396,51,"and, when it quickens, alter the actions' pace"
2397,51,till field and roof lie level and the same
2398,51,"so fast i move defying time, the quiet gentleman"
2399,51,"whose beard wags in egyptian wind,"
2400,51,
2401,51,"i have heard may years of telling,"
2402,51,"and many years should see some change,"
2403,51,
2404,51,the ball i threw while playing in the park
2405,51,"has not yet reached the ground,"
2406,52,"sometimes the sky's too bright,"
2407,52,"or has too many clouds or birds,"
2408,52,and far away's too sharp a sun
2409,52,"to nourish thinking of him,"
2410,52,why is my hand too blunt
2411,52,to cut in front of me
2412,52,"my horrid images for me,"
2413,52,"of over-fruitful smiles,"
2414,52,the weightless touching of the lip
2415,52,i wish to know
2416,52,"i cannot lift, but can,"
2417,52,the creature with the angel's face
2418,52,"who tells me hurt,"
2419,52,and sees my body go
2420,52,down into misery?
2421,52,"no stopping, put the smile"
2422,52,"where tears have come to dry,"
2423,52,the angel's hurt is left;
2424,52,"his telling burns,"
2425,52,
2426,52,"sometimes a woman's heart has salt,"
2427,52,or too much blood;
2428,52,"i tear her breast,"
2429,52,"and see the blood is mine,"
2430,52,"flowing from her, but mine,"
2431,52,and then i think
2432,52,perhaps the sky's too bright;
2433,52,"and watch my hand,"
2434,52,"but do not follow it,"
2435,52,"and feel the pain it gives,"
2436,52,"but do not ache,"
2437,53,the conversation of prayers about to be said
2438,53,by the child going to bed and the man on the stairs
2439,53,"who climbs to his dying love in her high room,"
2440,53,the one not caring to whom in his sleep he will move
2441,53,"and the other full of tears that she will be dead,"
2442,53,
2443,53,turns in the dark on the sound they know will arise
2444,53,"into the answering skies from the green ground,"
2445,53,"from the man on the stairs and the child by his bed,"
2446,53,the sound about to be said in the two prayers
2447,53,for the sleep in a safe land and the love who dies
2448,53,
2449,53,"will be the same grief flying, whom shall they calm?"
2450,53,shall the child sleep unharmed or the man be crying?
2451,53,the conversation of prayers about to be said
2452,53,"turns on the quick and the dead, and the man on the stair"
2453,53,to-night shall find no dying but alive and warm
2454,53,
2455,53,"in the fire of his care his love in the high room,"
2456,53,and the child not caring to whom he climbs his prayer
2457,53,"shall drown in a grief as deep as his made grave,"
2458,53,"and mark the dark eyed wave, through the eyes of sleep,"
2459,53,"dragging him up the stairs to one who lies dead,"
2460,54,the force that through the green fuse drives the flower
2461,54,drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees
2462,54,"is my destroyer,"
2463,54,and i am dumb to tell the crooked rose
2464,54,"my youth is bent by the same wintry fever,"
2465,54,
2466,54,the force that drives the water through the rocks
2467,54,drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams
2468,54,"turns mine to wax,"
2469,54,and i am dumb to mouth unto my veins
2470,54,"how at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks,"
2471,54,
2472,54,the hand that whirls the water in the pool
2473,54,stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind
2474,54,"hauls my shroud sail,"
2475,54,and i am dumb to tell the hanging man
2476,54,"how of my clay is made the hangman's lime,"
2477,54,
2478,54,the lips of time leech to the fountain head;
2479,54,"love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood"
2480,54,"shall calm her sores,"
2481,54,and i am dumb to tell a weather's wind
2482,54,"how time has ticked a heaven round the stars,"
2483,54,
2484,54,and i am dumb to tell the lover's tomb
2485,54,"how at my sheet goes the same crooked worm,"
2486,55,the hand that signed the paper felled a city;
2487,55,"five sovereign fingers taxed the breath,"
2488,55,doubled the globe of dead and halved a country;
2489,55,"these five kings did a king to death,"
2490,55,
2491,55,"the mighty hand leads to a sloping shoulder,"
2492,55,the finger joints are cramped with chalk;
2493,55,a goose's quill has put an end to murder
2494,55,"that put an end to talk,"
2495,55,
2496,55,"the hand that signed the treaty bred a fever,"
2497,55,"and famine grew, and locusts came;"
2498,55,great is the hand that holds dominion over
2499,55,"man by a scribbled name,"
2500,55,
2501,55,the five kings count the dead but do not soften
2502,55,the crusted wound nor pat the brow;
2503,55,a hand rules pity as a hand rules heaven;
2504,55,"hands have no tears to flow,"
2505,56,the seed-at-zero shall not storm
2506,56,"that town of ghosts, the trodden womb,"
2507,56,"with her rampart to his tapping,"
2508,56,no god-in-hero tumble down
2509,56,like a tower on the town

2826,66,"awake, my sleeper, to the sun,"
2827,66,"a worker in the morning town,"
2828,66,and leave the poppied pickthank where he lies;
2829,66,"the fences of the light are down,"
2830,66,all but the briskest riders thrown
2831,66,"and worlds hang on the trees,"
2832,67,"when, like a running grave, time tracks you down,"
2833,67,"your calm and cuddled is a scythe of hairs,"
2834,67,"love in her gear is slowly through the house,"
2835,67,"up naked stairs, a turtle in a hearse,"
2836,67,"hauled to the dome,"
2837,67,
2838,67,"comes, like a scissors stalking, tailor age,"
2839,67,"deliver me who timid in my tribe,"
2840,67,of love am barer than cadaver's trap
2841,67,"robbed of the foxy tongue, his footed tape"
2842,67,of the bone inch
2843,67,
2844,67,"deliver me, my masters, head and heart,"
2845,67,"heart of cadaver's candle waxes thin,"
2846,67,"when blood, spade-handed, and the logic time"
2847,67,"drive children up like bruises to the thumb,"
2848,67,"from maid and head,"
2849,67,
2850,67,"for, sunday faced, with dusters in my glove,"
2851,67,"chaste and the chaser, man with the cockshut eye,"
2852,67,"i, that time's jacket or the coat of ice"
2853,67,may fail to fasten with a virgin o
2854,67,"in the straight grave,"
2855,67,
2856,67,"stride through cadaver's country in my force,"
2857,67,my pickbrain masters morsing on the stone
2858,67,"despair of blood faith in the maiden's slime,"
2859,67,"halt among eunuchs, and the nitric stain"
2860,67,"on fork and face,"
2861,67,
2862,67,"time is a foolish fancy, time and fool,"
2863,67,"no, no, you lover skull, descending hammer"
2864,67,"descends, my masters, on the entered honour,"
2865,67,"you hero skull, cadaver in the hangar"
2866,67,"tells the stick, 'fail,'"
2867,67,
2868,67,"joy is no knocking nation, sir and madam,"
2869,67,"the cancer's fashion, or the summer feather"
2870,67,"lit on the cuddled tree, the cross of fever,"
2871,67,not city tar and subway bored to foster
2872,67,"man through macadam,"
2873,67,
2874,67,"i dump the waxlights in your tower dome,"
2875,67,"joy is the knock of dust, cadaver's shoot"
2876,67,"of bud of adam through his boxy shift,"
2877,67,"love's twilit nation and the skull of state,"
2878,67,"sir, is your doom,"
2879,67,
2880,67,"everything ends, the tower ending and,"
2881,67,"have with the house of wind, the leaning scene,"
2882,67,"ball of the foot depending from the sun,"
2883,67,"give, summer, over, the cemented skin,"
2884,67,"the actions' end,"
2885,67,
2886,67,"all, men my madmen, the unwholesome wind"
2887,67,"with whistler's cough contages, time on track"
2888,67,"shapes in a cinder death; love for his trick,"
2889,67,happy cadaver's hunger as you take
2890,67,"the kissproof world,"
2891,68,where once the waters of your face
2892,68,"spun to my screws, your dry ghost blows,"
2893,68,the dead turns up its eye;
2894,68,where once the mermen through your ice
2895,68,"pushed up their hair, the dry wind steers"
2896,68,"through salt and root and roe,"
2897,68,
2898,68,where once your green knots sank their splice
2899,68,"into the tided cord, there goes"
2900,68,"the green unraveller,"
2901,68,"his scissors oiled, his knife hung loose"
2902,68,to cut the channels at their source
2903,68,"and lay the wet fruits low,"
2904,68,
2905,68,"invisible, your clocking tides"
2906,68,break on the lovebeds of the weeds;
2907,68,the weed of love's left dry;
2908,68,there round about your stones the shades
2909,68,"of children go who, from their voids,"
2910,68,"cry to the dolphined sea,"
2911,68,
2912,68,"dry as a tomb, your coloured lids"
2913,68,shall not be latched while magic glides
2914,68,sage on the earth and sky;
2915,68,there shall be corals in your beds
2916,68,"there shall be serpents in your tides,"
2917,68,"till all our sea-faiths die,"
