1355,34,"just as much for us that sobbing dirge of nature,"

1364,35,"i know my words are weapons, full of danger, full of death;"
1365,35,"for i confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle them;"
1366,35,"i am more resolute because all have denied me, than i could ever have been had all accepted me;"
1367,35,"i heed not, and have never heeded either experience, cautions, majorities, or ridicule;"
1368,35,and the threat of what is called hell is little or nothing to me;
1369,35,and the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me;
1370,35,"dear camerado! i confess i have urged you onward with me, and still urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,"
1371,35,"or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quelled and defeated,"
1372,36,"as i ponder'd in silence,"
1373,36,"returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,"
1374,36,"a phantom arose before me, with distrustful aspect,"
1375,36,"terrible in beauty, age, and power,"
1376,36,"the genius of poets of old lands,"
1377,36,"as to me directing like flame its eyes,"
1378,36,"with finger pointing to many immortal songs,"
1379,36,"and menacing voice, what singest thou? it said;"
1380,36,"know'st thou not, there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards?"
1381,36,"and that is the theme of war, the fortune of battles,              "
1382,36,
1383,36,the making of perfect soldiers?
1384,36,
1385,36,"be it so, then i answer'd,"
1386,36,"i too, haughty shade, also sing war--and a longer and greater one"
1387,36,"        than any,"
1388,36,"waged in my book with varying fortune--with flight, advance, and"
1389,36,"        retreat--victory deferr'd and wavering,"
1390,36,"yet, methinks, certain, or as good as certain, at the last,--the"
1391,36,        field the world;
1392,36,"for life and death--for the body, and for the eternal soul,"
1393,36,"lo! too am come, chanting the chant of battles,"
1394,36,"i, above all, promote brave soldiers,"
1395,37,", as i sat alone, by blue ontario's shore,"
1396,37,"  as i mused of these mighty days, and of peace return'd, and the dead"
1397,37,"        that return no more,"
1398,37,"  a phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted me;"
1399,37,"  chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of america--"
1400,37,        chant me the carol of victory;
1401,37,  and strike up the marches of libertad--marches more powerful yet;
1402,37,"  and sing me before you go, the song of the throes of democracy,"
1403,37,
1404,37,  democracy--the destin'd conqueror--yet treacherous lip-smiles
1405,37,"        everywhere,"
1406,37,"  and death and infidelity at every step,"
1407,37,
1408,37,"  a nation announcing itself,"
1409,37,"  i myself make the only growth by which i can be appreciated,      "
1410,37,
1411,37,"  i reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms,"
1412,37,
1413,37,  a breed whose proof is in time and deeds;
1414,37,"  what we are, we are--nativity is answer enough to objections;"
1415,37,"  we wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,"
1416,37,"  we are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,"
1417,37,  we are executive in ourselves--we are sufficient in the variety of
1418,37,"        ourselves,"
1419,37,"  we are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves;"
1420,37,"  we stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world;"
1421,37,"  from missouri, nebraska, or kansas, laughing attacks to scorn,"
1422,37,
1423,37,"  nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,                      "
1424,37,
1425,37,"  whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or"
1426,37,"        sinful in ourselves only,"
1427,37,
1428,37,  o mother! o sisters dear!
1429,37,"  if we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us;"
1430,37,"  it is by ourselves we go down to eternal night,"
1431,37,
1432,37,  have you thought there could be but a single supreme?
1433,37,  there can be any number of supremes--one does not countervail
1434,37,"        another, any more than one eyesight countervails another, or"
1435,37,"        one life countervails another,"
1436,37,
1437,37,"  all is eligible to all,"
1438,37,"  all is for individuals--all is for you,"
1439,37,"  no condition is prohibited--not god's, or any,"
1440,37,
1441,37,  all comes by the body--only health puts you rapport with the
1442,37,"        universe,                                                    "

1445,37,
1446,37,  america isolated i sing;
1447,37,"  i say that works made here in the spirit of other lands, are so much"
1448,37,"        poison in the states,"
1449,37,
1450,37,  how dare such insects as we see assume to write poems for america?
1451,37,"  for our victorious armies, and the offspring following the armies?"
1452,37,
1453,37,  piety and conformity to them that like!
1454,37,"  peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like!"
1455,37,"  i am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,"
1456,37,"  crying, leap from your seats, and contend for your lives!"
1457,37,
1458,37,"  i am he who walks the states with a barb'd tongue, questioning every"
1459,37,        one i meet;                                                  
1460,37,
1461,37,"  who are you, that wanted only to be told what you knew before?"
1462,37,"  who are you, that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?"
1463,37,
1464,37,"  with pangs and cries, as thine own, o bearer of many children!"
1465,37,"  these clamors wild, to a race of pride i give,"
1466,37,
1467,37,  o lands! would you be freer than all that has ever been before?
1468,37,"  if you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to"
1469,37,"        me,"
1470,37,
1471,37,"  fear grace--fear elegance, civilization, delicatesse,"
1472,37,"  fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-juice;"
1473,37,"  beware the advancing mortal ripening of nature,"
1474,37,  beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and
1475,37,"        men,                                                        "
1476,37,
1477,37,"  ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,"
1478,37,"  america brings builders, and brings its own styles,"
1479,37,
1480,37,"  the immortal poets of asia and europe have done their work, and"
1481,37,"        pass'd to other spheres,"
1482,37,"  a work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done,"
1483,37,
1484,37,"  america, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all"
1485,37,"        hazards,"
1486,37,"  stands removed, spacious, composite, sound--initiates the true use of"
1487,37,"        precedents,"
1488,37,"  does not repel them, or the past, or what they have produced under"
1489,37,"        their forms,"
1490,37,"  takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne"
1491,37,"        from the house,"
1492,37,  perceives that it waits a little while in the door--that it was
1493,37,"        fittest for its days,"
1494,37,  that its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who
1495,37,"        approaches,                                                  "
1496,37,
1497,37,"  and that he shall be fittest for his days,"
1498,37,
1499,37,"  any period, one nation must lead,"
1500,37,"  one land must be the promise and reliance of the future,"
1501,37,
1502,37,"  these states are the amplest poem,"
1503,37,"  here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations,"
1504,37,  here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the
1505,37,"        day and night,"
1506,37,"  here is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars,"
1507,37,"  here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the soul"
1508,37,"        loves,"
1509,37,"  here the flowing trains--here the crowds, equality, diversity, the"
1510,37,"        soul loves,"
1511,37,
1512,37,"  land of lands, and bards to corroborate!                          "
1513,37,
1514,37,"  of them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his west-bred"
1515,37,"        face,"
1516,37,"  to him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd, both mother's and"
1517,37,"        father's,"
1518,37,"  his first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,"
1519,37,"  built of the common stock, having room for far and near,"
1520,37,"  used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,"
1521,37,"  attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its neck with"
1522,37,"        incomparable love,"
1523,37,"  plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,"
1524,37,"  making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in"
1525,37,"        him,"
1526,37,"  making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,"
1527,37,"  mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes--columbia,"
1528,37,"        niagara, hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,        "
1529,37,
1530,37,"  if the atlantic coast stretch, or the pacific coast stretch, he"
1531,37,"        stretching with them north or south,"
1532,37,"  spanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is"
1533,37,"        between them,"
1534,37,"  growths growing from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar,"
1535,37,"        hemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood,"
1536,37,"        orange, magnolia,"
1537,37,"  tangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp,"
1538,37,"  he likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with"
1539,37,"        northern transparent ice,"
1540,37,"  off him pasturage, sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,"
1541,37,"  through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish-"
1542,37,"        hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle;"
1543,37,"  his spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and"
1544,37,"        evil,"
1545,37,"  surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,"
1546,37,"  surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,  "
1547,37,
1548,37,"  weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and"
1549,37,"        muscle,"
1550,37,"  the haughty defiance of the year 1--war, peace, the formation of the"
1551,37,"        constitution,"
1552,37,"  the separate states, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants,"
1553,37,"  the union, always swarming with blatherers, and always sure and"
1554,37,"        impregnable,"
1555,37,"  the unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals,"
1556,37,"        hunters, trappers;"
1557,37,"  surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the"
1558,37,"        gestation of new states,"
1559,37,"  congress convening every twelfth-month, the members duly coming up"
1560,37,        from the uttermost parts;
1561,37,"  surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially"
1562,37,"        the young men,"
1563,37,"  responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships--the gait they"
1564,37,        have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the
1565,37,"        presence of superiors,"
1566,37,"  the freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and"
1567,37,"        decision of their phrenology,                              "
1568,37,
1569,37,"  the picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when"
1570,37,"        wrong'd,"
1571,37,"  the fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,"
1572,37,"        good temper, and open-handedness--the whole composite make,"
1573,37,"  the prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,"
1574,37,"  the perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement"
1575,37,"        of the population,"
1576,37,"  the superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,"
1577,37,"  wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all"
1578,37,"        points,"
1579,37,"  factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east,"
1580,37,"        north-west, south-west,"
1581,37,"  manhattan firemen, the yankee swap, southern plantation life,"
1582,37,"  slavery--the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the"
1583,37,        ruins of all the rest;
1584,37,  on and on to the grapple with it--assassin! then your life or ours be
1585,37,"        the stake--and respite no more,                            "
1586,37,
1587,37,"  lo! high toward heaven, this day,"
1588,37,"  libertad! from the conqueress' field return'd,"
1589,37,  i mark the new aureola around your head;
1590,37,"  no more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,"
1591,37,"  with war's flames, and the lambent lightnings playing,"
1592,37,  and your port immovable where you stand;
1593,37,"  with still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd and lifted"
1594,37,"        fist,"
1595,37,"  and your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly"
1596,37,        crush'd beneath you;
1597,37,"  the menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his"
1598,37,"        senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife;"
1599,37,"  --lo! the wide swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so"
1600,37,        much!                                                      
1601,37,
1602,37,"  to-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth!"
1603,37,"  an offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd,"
1604,37,
1605,37,"  others take finish, but the republic is ever constructive, and ever"
1606,37,        keeps vista;
1607,37,"  others adorn the past--but you, o days of the present, i adorn you!"
1608,37,"  o days of the future, i believe in you! i isolate myself for your"
1609,37,        sake;
1610,37,"  o america, because you build for mankind, i build for you!"
1611,37,  o well-beloved stone-cutters! i lead them who plan with decision and
1612,37,"        science,"
1613,37,"  i lead the present with friendly hand toward the future,"
1614,37,
1615,37,  bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!
1616,37,"  but damn that which spends itself, with no thought of the stain,"
1617,37,"        pains, dismay, feebleness it is bequeathing,                "
1618,37,
1619,37,"  i listened to the phantom by ontario's shore,"
1620,37,"  i heard the voice arising, demanding bards;"
1621,37,"  by them, all native and grand--by them alone can the states be fused"
1622,37,"        into the compact organism of a nation,"
1623,37,
1624,37,"  to hold men together by paper and seal, or by compulsion, is no"
1625,37,        account;
1626,37,  that only holds men together which aggregates all in a living
1627,37,"        principle, as the hold of the limbs of the body, or the fibres"
1628,37,"        of plants,"
1629,37,
1630,37,"  of all races and eras, these states, with veins full of poetical"
1631,37,"        stuff, most need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use"
1632,37,        them the greatest;
1633,37,  their presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their
1634,37,"        poets shall,"
1635,37,
1636,37,"  soul of love, and tongue of fire!"
1637,37,"  eye to pierce the deepest deeps, and sweep the world!"
1638,37,"  --ah, mother! prolific and full in all besides--yet how long barren,"
1639,37,        barren?                                                    
1640,37,
1641,37,"  of these states, the poet is the equable man,"
1642,37,"  not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail"
1643,37,"        of their full returns,"
1644,37,"  nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,"
1645,37,"  he bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither"
1646,37,"        more nor less,"
1647,37,"  he is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,"
1648,37,"  he is the equalizer of his age and land,"
1649,37,"  he supplies what wants supplying--he checks what wants checking,"
1650,37,"  in peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,"
1651,37,"        thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture,"
1652,37,"        arts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the soul, health,"
1653,37,"        immortality, government;"
1654,37,"  in war, he is the best backer of the war--he fetches artillery as"
1655,37,        good as the engineer's--he can make every word he speaks draw
1656,37,        blood;
1657,37,"  the years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by his steady"
1658,37,"        faith,                                                      "
1659,37,
1660,37,"  he is no argurer, he is judgment--nature accepts him absolutely"
1661,37,"  he judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round a"
1662,37,        helpless thing;
1663,37,"  as he sees the farthest, he has the most faith,"
1664,37,"  his thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,"
1665,37,"  in the dispute on god and eternity he is silent,"
1666,37,"  he sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,"
1667,37,  he sees eternity in men and women--he does not see men and women as
1668,37,"        dreams or dots,"
1669,37,
1670,37,"  for the great idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,"
1671,37,"  for that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,"
1672,37,  the attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign
1673,37,"        despots,                                                    "
1674,37,
1675,37,  without extinction is liberty! without retrograde is equality!
1676,37,"  they live in the feelings of young men, and the best women;"
1677,37,  not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always
1678,37,"        ready to fall for liberty,"
1679,37,
1680,37,  for the great idea!
1681,37,"  that, o my brethren--that is the mission of poets,"
1682,37,
1683,37,"  songs of stern defiance, ever ready,"
1684,37,"  songs of the rapid arming, and the march,"
1685,37,"  the flag of peace quick-folded, and instead, the flag we know,"
1686,37,"  warlike flag of the great idea,"
1687,37,
1688,37,  angry cloth i saw there leaping!                                
1689,37,
1690,37,"  i stand again in leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting;"
1691,37,"  i sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight--o the hard-"
1692,37,        contested fight!
1693,37,  o the cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles! the hurtled balls
1694,37,        scream!
1695,37,
1696,37,  the battle-front forms amid the smoke--the volleys pour incessant
1697,37,        from the line;
1698,37,"  hark! the ringing word, charge!--now the tussle, and the furious"
1699,37,        maddening yells;
1700,37,"  now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,"
1701,37,"  cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,"
1702,37,"  angry cloth i saw there leaping,"
1703,37,
1704,37,"  are you he who would assume a place to teach, or be a poet here in"
1705,37,        the states?
1706,37,"  the place is august--the terms obdurate,                          "
1707,37,
1708,37,"  who would assume to teach here, may well prepare himself, body and"
1709,37,"        mind,"
1710,37,"  he may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe,"
1711,37,"        himself,"
1712,37,  he shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with many and stern
1713,37,"        questions,"
1714,37,
1715,37,"  who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing to america?"
1716,37,"  have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?"
1717,37,"  have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography,"
1718,37,"        pride, freedom, friendship, of the land? its substratums and"
1719,37,        objects?
1720,37,  have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day of the first
1721,37,"        year of independence, sign'd by the commissioners, ratified by"
1722,37,"        the states, and read by washington at the head of the army?"
1723,37,  have you possess'd yourself of the federal constitution?
1724,37,"  do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them,"
1725,37,        and assumed the poems and processes of democracy?
1726,37,"  are you faithful to things? do you teach as the land and sea, the"
1727,37,"        bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, angers, teach?      "
1728,37,
1729,37,"  have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?"
1730,37,"  can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls,"
1731,37,        fierce contentions? are you very strong? are you really of the
1732,37,        whole people?
1733,37,  are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion?
1734,37,  are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to
1735,37,        life itself?
1736,37,  have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these states?
1737,37,"  have you too the old, ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality?"
1738,37,  do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity; for the
1739,37,        last-born? little and big? and for the errant?
1740,37,
1741,37,  what is this you bring my america?
1742,37,  is it uniform with my country?
1743,37,  is it not something that has been better told or done before?    
1744,37,
1745,37,"  have you not imported this, or the spirit of it, in some ship?"
1746,37,  is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? is the good old cause
1747,37,        in it?
1748,37,"  has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,"
1749,37,"        literats, of enemies' lands?"
1750,37,  does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?
1751,37,  does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?
1752,37,"  does it sound, with trumpet-voice, the proud victory of the union, in"
1753,37,        that secession war?
1754,37,  can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?
1755,37,"  will it absorb into me as i absorb food, air--to appear again in my"
1756,37,"        strength, gait, face?"
1757,37,  have real employments contributed to it? original makers--not mere
1758,37,        amanuenses?
1759,37,"  does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, facts face to face?    "
1760,37,
1761,37,"  what does it mean to me? to american persons, progresses, cities?"
1762,37,"        chicago, kanada, arkansas? the planter, yankee, georgian,"
1763,37,"        native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old states, new states?"
1764,37,"  does it encompass all the states, and the unexceptional rights of all"
1765,37,        the men and women of the earth? the genital impulse of these
1766,37,        states
1767,37,"  does it see behind the apparent custodians, the real custodians,"
1768,37,"        standing, menacing, silent--the mechanics, manhattanese,"
1769,37,"        western men, southerners, significant alike in their apathy,"
1770,37,        and in the promptness of their love?
1771,37,"  does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen,"
1772,37,"        each temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist,"
1773,37,"        infidel, who has ever ask'd anything of america?"
1774,37,  what mocking and scornful negligence?
1775,37,  the track strew'd with the dust of skeletons;
1776,37,"  by the roadside others disdainfully toss'd,"
1777,37,
1778,37,  rhymes and rhymers pass away--poems distill'd from foreign poems pass
1779,37,"        away,"
1780,37,"  the swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes;"
1781,37,"  admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soul of"
1782,37,        literature;                                                
1783,37,
1784,37,"  america justifies itself, give it time--no disguise can deceive it,"
1785,37,"        or conceal from it--it is impassive enough,"
1786,37,"  only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,"
1787,37,"  if its poets appear, it will in due time advance to meet them--there"
1788,37,"        is no fear of mistake,"
1789,37,"  the proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd, till his country"
1790,37,"        absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it,"
1791,37,
1792,37,  he masters whose spirit masters--he tastes sweetest who results
1793,37,        sweetest in the long run;
1794,37,  the blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;
1795,37,"  in the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners, engineering, an"
1796,37,"        appropriate native grand-opera, shipcraft, any craft, he or she"
1797,37,        is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical
1798,37,"        example,"
1799,37,
1800,37,"  already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the"
1801,37,"        streets,"
1802,37,"  people's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive"
1803,37,        knowers; there will shortly be no more priests--i say their
1804,37,"        work is done,                                              "
1805,37,
1806,37,"  death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies"
1807,37,"        here,"
1808,37,"  are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be"
1809,37,        superb;
1810,37,"  justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible power;"
1811,37,  how dare you place anything before a man?
1812,37,
1813,37,"  fall behind me, states!"
1814,37,"  a man before all--myself, typical before all,"
1815,37,
1816,37,  give me the pay i have served for!
1817,37,  give me to sing the song of the great idea! take all the rest;
1818,37,"  i have loved the earth, sun, animals--i have despised riches,"
1819,37,"  i have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid"
1820,37,"        and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others,          "
1821,37,
1822,37,"  i have hated tyrants, argued not concerning god, had patience and"
1823,37,"        indulgence toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing known"
1824,37,"        or unknown,"
1825,37,"  i have gone freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the"
1826,37,"        young, and with the mothers of families,"
1827,37,  i have read these leaves to myself in the open air--i have tried them
1828,37,"        by trees, stars, rivers,"
1829,37,"  i have dismiss'd whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body,"
1830,37,  i have claim'd nothing to myself which i have not carefully claim'd
1831,37,"        for others on the same terms,"
1832,37,"  i have sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every"
1833,37,        state;
1834,37,"  in war of you, as well as peace, my suit is good, america--sadly i"
1835,37,        boast;
1836,37,"  upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd, to breathe his"
1837,37,        last;
1838,37,"  this arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,"
1839,37,  to life recalling many a prostrate form                        
1840,37,
1841,37,  --i am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of
1842,37,"        myself,"
1843,37,"  i reject none, i permit all,"
1844,37,
1845,37,"  say, o mother! have i not to your thought been faithful?"
1846,37,"  have i not, through life, kept you and yours before me?"
1847,37,
1848,37,  i swear i begin to see the meaning of these things!
1849,37,"  it is not the earth, it is not america, who is so great,"
1850,37,"  it is i who am great, or to be great--it is you up there, or any one;"
1851,37,"  it is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,"
1852,37,"  through poems, pageants, shows, to form great individuals,"
1853,37,
1854,37,"  underneath all, individuals!                                      "
1855,37,
1856,37,"  i swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,"
1857,37,"  the american compact is altogether with individuals,"
1858,37,"  the only government is that which makes minute of individuals,"
1859,37,  the whole theory of the universe is directed to one single
1860,37,"        individual--namely, to you,"
1861,37,
1862,37,"  mother! with subtle sense severe--with the naked sword in your hand,"
1863,37,"  i saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals,"
1864,37,
1865,37,"  underneath all, nativity,"
1866,37,"  i swear i will stand by my own nativity--pious or impious, so be it;"
1867,37,"  i swear i am charm'd with nothing except nativity,"
1868,37,"  men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity,    "
1869,37,
1870,37,  underneath all is the need of the expression of love for men and
1871,37,"        women,"
1872,37,  i swear i have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing
1873,37,"        love for men and women,"
1874,37,  after this day i take my own modes of expressing love for men and
1875,37,"        women,"
1876,37,
1877,37,"  i swear i will have each quality of my race in myself,"
1878,37,"  talk as you like, he only suits these states whose manners favor the"
1879,37,"        audacity and sublime turbulence of the states,"
1880,37,
1881,37,"  underneath the lessons of things, spirits, nature, governments,"
1882,37,"        ownerships, i swear i perceive other lessons,"
1883,37,"  underneath all, to me is myself--to you, yourself--the same"
1884,37,"        monotonous old song,"
1885,37,
1886,37,"  o i see now, flashing, that this america is only you and me,"
1887,37,"  its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,"
1888,37,"  its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you and me,    "
1889,37,
1890,37,"  its congress is you and me--the officers, capitols, armies, ships,"
1891,37,"        are you and me,"
1892,37,"  its endless gestations of new states are you and me,"
1893,37,  the war--that war so bloody and grim--the war i will henceforth
1894,37,"        forget--was you and me,"
1895,37,"  natural and artificial are you and me,"
1896,37,"  freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,"
1897,37,"  past, present, future, are you and me,"
1898,37,
1899,37,"  i swear i dare not shirk any part of myself,"
1900,37,"  not any part of america, good or bad,"
1901,37,  not the promulgation of liberty--not to cheer up slaves and horrify
1902,37,"        foreign despots,"
1903,37,"  not to build for that which builds for mankind,                  "
1904,37,
1905,37,"  not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,"
1906,37,"  not to justify science, nor the march of equality,"
1907,37,"  nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn beloved of time,"
1908,37,
1909,37,  i swear i am for those that have never been master'd!
1910,37,"  for men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,"
1911,37,"  for those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master,"
1912,37,
1913,37,  i swear i am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth!
1914,37,"  who inaugurate one, to inaugurate all,"
1915,37,
1916,37,  i swear i will not be outfaced by irrational things!
1917,37,  i will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me!    
1918,37,
1919,37,  i will make cities and civilizations defer to me!
1920,37,  this is what i have learnt from america--it is the amount--and it i
1921,37,"        teach again,"
1922,37,
1923,37,"  democracy! while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,"
1924,37,  i saw you serenely give birth to immortal children--saw in dreams
1925,37,        your dilating form;
1926,37,"  saw you with spreading mantle covering the world,"
1927,37,
1928,37,  i will confront these shows of the day and night!
1929,37,  i will know if i am to be less than they!
1930,37,  i will see if i am not as majestic as they!
1931,37,  i will see if i am not as subtle and real as they!
1932,37,  i will see if i am to be less generous than they!                
1933,37,
1934,37,"  i will see if i have no meaning, while the houses and ships have"
1935,37,        meaning!
1936,37,"  i will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,"
1937,37,"        and i am not to be enough for myself,"
1938,37,
1939,37,"  i match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths, mountains,"
1940,37,"        brutes,"
1941,37,"  copious as you are, i absorb you all in myself, and become the master"
1942,37,"        myself,"
1943,37,
1944,37,"  america isolated, yet embodying all, what is it finally except"
1945,37,        myself?
1946,37,  these states--what are they except myself?
1947,37,
1948,37,"  i know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked--it is for my"
1949,37,"        sake,"
1950,37,"  i take you to be mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude forms,"
1951,37,
1952,37,"  mother! bend down, bend close to me your face!"
1953,37,"  i know not what these plots and wars, and deferments are for;    "
1954,37,
1955,37,  i know not fruition's success--but i know that through war and peace
1956,37,"        your work goes on, and must yet go on,"
1957,37,
1958,37,"  ,, thus, by blue ontario's shore,"
1959,37,"  while the winds fann'd me, and the waves came trooping toward me,"
1960,37,  i thrill'd with the power's pulsations--and the charm of my theme was
1961,37,"        upon me,"
1962,37,"  till the tissues that held me, parted their ties upon me,"
1963,37,
1964,37,  and i saw the free souls of poets;
1965,37,"  the loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,"
1966,37,"  strange, large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me,"
1967,37,
1968,37,"  o my rapt verse, my call--mock me not!"
1969,37,  not for the bards of the past--not to invoke them have i launch'd you
1970,37,"        forth,                                                      "
1971,37,
1972,37,"  not to call even those lofty bards here by ontario's shores,"
1973,37,"  have i sung so capricious and loud, my savage song,"
1974,37,
1975,37,"  bards for my own land, only, i invoke;"
1976,37,"  for the war, the war is over--the field is clear'd,"
1977,37,"  till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,"
1978,37,"  to cheer, o mother, your boundless, expectant soul,"
1979,37,
1980,37,  bards grand as these days so grand!
1981,37,  bards of the great idea! bards of the peaceful inventions! for the
1982,37,"        war, the war is over!"
1983,37,"  yet bards of the latent armies--a million soldiers waiting, ever-"
1984,37,"        ready,"
1985,37,"  bards towering like hills--no more these dots, these pigmies, these"
1986,37,"        little piping straws, these gnats, that fill the hour, to pass"
1987,37,        for poets                                                
1988,37,
1989,37,"  bards with songs as from burning coals, or the lightning's fork'd"
1990,37,        stripes!
1991,37,  ample ohio's bards--bards for california! inland bards--bards of the
1992,37,        war
1993,37,"  as a wheel turns on its axle, so i find my chants turning finally on"
1994,37,        the war
1995,37,"  bards of pride! bards tallying the ocean's roar, and the swooping"
1996,37,        eagle's scream!
1997,37,"  you, by my charm, i invoke!"
1998,38,"as i walk these broad, majestic days of peace,"
1999,38,"for the war, the struggle of blood finish'd, wherein, o terrific"
2000,38,        ideal!
2001,38,"against vast odds, having gloriously won,"
2002,38,"now thou stridest on--yet perhaps in time toward denser wars,"
2003,38,"perhaps to engage in time in still more dreadful contests, dangers,"
2004,38,"longer campaigns and crises, labors beyond all others;"
2005,38,"--as i walk solitary, unattended,"
2006,38,"around me i hear that eclat of the world--politics, produce,"
2007,38,"the announcements of recognized things--science,"
2008,38,"the approved growth of cities, and the spread of inventions,      "
2009,38,
2010,38,"i see the ships, they will last a few years,"
2011,38,"the vast factories, with their foremen and workmen,"
2012,38,"and here the endorsement of all, and do not object to it,"
2013,38,
2014,38,but i too announce solid things;
2015,38,"science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothing--i watch"
2016,38,"        them,"
2017,38,"like a grand procession, to music of distant bugles, pouring,"
2018,38,        triumphantly moving--and grander heaving in sight;
2019,38,"they stand for realities--all is as it should be,"
2020,38,
2021,38,then my realities;
2022,38,what else is so real as mine?
2023,38,"libertad, and the divine average--freedom to every slave on the face"
2024,38,"        of the earth,                                                "
2025,38,
2026,38,the rapt promises and luminé of seers--the spiritual world--these

2222,48,"how there is something relentless in their fate, all times;"

3127,64,"cool and sweeten ohio's villages, with leaves fluttering in the"
3128,64,        moderate wind;
3129,64,"where apples ripe in the orchards hang, and grapes on the trellis'd"
3130,64,        vines;
3131,64,smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
3132,64,"smell you the buckwheat, where the bees were lately buzzing?"
3133,64,
3134,64,"above all, lo, the sky, so calm, so transparent after the rain, and"

3141,64,"and come to the entry, mother--to the front door come, right away,"
3142,64,
3143,64,fast as she can she hurries--something ominous--her steps trembling;

3149,64,all swims before her eyes--flashes with black--she catches the main
3150,64,        words only;
3151,64,"sentences broken--gun-shot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,"
3152,64,"        taken to hospital,                                          "

3176,64,"in the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,"
3177,64,"o that she might withdraw unnoticed--silent from life, escape and"

3201,66,"the impalpable sustenance of me from all things, at all hours of the"

3204,66,"        one disintegrated, yet part of the scheme,"
3205,66,"the similitude's of the past, and those of the future;"
3206,66,the glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings--on
3207,66,"        the walk in the street, and the passage over the river;"
3208,66,"the current rushing so swiftly, and swimming with me far away;    "
3209,66,
3210,66,"the others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them;"
3211,66,"the certainty of others--the life, love, sight, hearing of others,"
3212,66,
3213,66,"others will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross from shore to"

3221,66,"a hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others"
3222,66,"        will see them,"
3223,66,"will enjoy the sunset, the pouring in of the flood-tide, the falling"
3224,66,"        back to the sea of the ebb-tide,"
3225,66,
3226,66,"it avails not, neither time or place--distance avails not;        "
3227,66,

3231,66,
3232,66,"just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so i felt;"
3233,66,"just as any of you is one of a living crowd, i was one of a crowd;"
3234,66,just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the bright
3235,66,"        flow, i was refresh'd;"
3236,66,"just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift"
3237,66,"        current, i stood, yet was hurried;"
3238,66,"just as you look on the numberless masts of ships, and the thick-"
3239,66,"        stem'd pipes of steamboats, i look'd,"
3240,66,
3241,66,"i too many and many a time cross'd the river, the sun half an hour"
3242,66,        high;
3243,66,"i watched the twelfth-month sea-gulls--i saw them high in the air,"
3244,66,"        floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,"
3245,66,"i saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies, and"
3246,66,"        left the rest in strong shadow,                              "
3247,66,
3248,66,"i saw the slow-wheeling circles, and the gradual edging toward the"
3249,66,"        south,"
3250,66,
3251,66,"i too saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,"
3252,66,"had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,"
3253,66,look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light around the shape of my
3254,66,"        head in the sun-lit water,"
3255,66,"look'd on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward,"
3256,66,"look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,"
3257,66,"look'd toward the lower bay to notice the arriving ships,"
3258,66,"saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,"
3259,66,"saw the white sails of schooners and sloops--saw the ships at anchor,"
3260,66,"the sailors at work in the rigging, or out astride the spars,      "
3261,66,
3262,66,"the round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender"
3263,66,"        serpentine pennants,"
3264,66,"the large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-"
3265,66,"        houses,"
3266,66,"the white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the"
3267,66,"        wheels,"
3268,66,"the flags of all nations, the falling of them at sun-set,"
3269,66,"the scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the"
3270,66,"        frolicsome crests and glistening,"
3271,66,"the stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the"
3272,66,"        granite store-houses by the docks,"
3273,66,"on the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on"
3274,66,"        each side by the barges--the hay-boat, the belated lighter,"
3275,66,"on the neighboring shore, the fires from the foundry chimneys burning"
3276,66,"        high and glaringly into the night,"
3277,66,"casting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild red and yellow"
3278,66,"        light, over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of"
3279,66,"        streets,"
3280,66,
3281,66,"these, and all else, were to me the same as they are to you;      "
3282,66,
3283,66,"i project myself a moment to tell you--also i return,"
3284,66,
3285,66,i loved well those cities;
3286,66,i loved well the stately and rapid river;
3287,66,the men and women i saw were all near to me;
3288,66,"others the same--others who look back on me, because i look'd forward"
3289,66,        to them;
3290,66,"the time will come, though i stop here to-day and to-night,"
3291,66,
3292,66,"what is it, then, between us?"
3293,66,what is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?
3294,66,
3295,66,"whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails"
3296,66,"        not,"
3297,66,
3298,66,"i too lived--brooklyn, of ample hills, was mine;                  "
3299,66,
3300,66,"i too walk'd the streets of manhattan island, and bathed in the"
3301,66,        waters around it;
3302,66,"i too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,"
3303,66,"in the day, among crowds of people, sometimes they came upon me,"
3304,66,"in my walks home late at night, or as i lay in my bed, they came upon"
3305,66,"        me,"
3306,66,
3307,66,i too had been struck from the float forever held in solution;
3308,66,i too had receiv'd identity by my body;
3309,66,"that i was, i knew was of my body--and what i should be, i knew i"
3310,66,"        should be of my body,"
3311,66,
3312,66,"it is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,"
3313,66,the dark threw patches down upon me also;
3314,66,the best i had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious;            
3315,66,
3316,66,"my great thoughts, as i supposed them, were they not in reality"
3317,66,        meagre? would not people laugh at me?
3318,66,
3319,66,it is not you alone who know what it is to be evil;
3320,66,i am he who knew what it was to be evil;
3321,66,"i too knitted the old knot of contrariety,"
3322,66,"blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,"
3323,66,"had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes i dared not speak,"
3324,66,"was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant;"
3325,66,"the wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,"
3326,66,"the cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not"
3327,66,"        wanting,"
3328,66,"refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these"
3329,66,"        wanting,                                                    "
3330,66,
3331,66,"but i was manhattanese, friendly and proud!"
3332,66,i was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as
3333,66,"        they saw me approaching or passing,"
3334,66,"felt their arms on my neck as i stood, or the negligent leaning of"
3335,66,"        their flesh against me as i sat,"
3336,66,"saw many i loved in the street, or ferry-boat, or public assembly,"
3337,66,"        yet never told them a word,"
3338,66,"lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing,"
3339,66,"        sleeping,"
3340,66,"play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,"
3341,66,"the same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we"

3352,66,who knows but i am enjoying this?
3353,66,"who knows but i am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot"
3354,66,        see me?
3355,66,
3356,66,"it is not you alone, nor i alone;"
3357,66,"not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries;"
3358,66,"it is that each came, or comes, or shall come, from its due emission,"

3762,75,
3763,75,"  as i ebb'd with an ebb of the ocean of life,"
3764,75,"  as i wended the shores i know,"
3765,75,"  as i walk'd where the ripples continually wash you, paumanok,"
3766,75,"  where they rustle up, hoarse and sibilant,"
3767,75,"  where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,"
3768,75,"  i, musing, late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,"
3769,75,"  alone, held by this eternal self of me, out of the pride of which i"
3770,75,"        utter my poems,"
3771,75,"  was seiz'd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,      "
3772,75,
3773,75,"  in the rim, the sediment, that stands for all the water and all the"
3774,75,"        land of the globe,"
3775,75,
3776,75,"  fascinated, my eyes, reverting from the south, dropt, to follow those"
3777,75,"        slender winrows,"
3778,75,"  chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,"
3779,75,"  scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the"
3780,75,"        tide,"
3781,75,"  miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,"
3782,75,"  paumanok, there and then, as i thought the old thought of likenesses,"
3783,75,"  these you presented to me, you fish-shaped island,"
3784,75,"  as i wended the shores i know,"
3785,75,"  as i walk'd with that eternal self of me, seeking types,"
3786,75,
3787,75,"  as i wend to the shores i know not,                                "
3788,75,
3789,75,"  as i list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck'd,"
3790,75,"  as i inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,"
3791,75,"  as the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,"
3792,75,"  i, too, but signify, at the utmost, a little wash'd-up drift,"
3793,75,"  a few sands and dead leaves to gather,"
3794,75,"  gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift,"
3795,75,
3796,75,"  o baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth,"
3797,75,"  oppress'd with myself that i have dared to open my mouth,"
3798,75,"  aware now, that, amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me, i"
3799,75,"        have not once had the least idea who or what i am,"
3800,75,  but that before all my insolent poems the real me stands yet

3802,75,
3803,75,"  withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows,"
3804,75,"  with peals of distant ironical laughter at every word i have written,"
3805,75,"  pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath,"
3806,75,
3807,75,  now i perceive i have not understood anything--not a single object--
3808,75,"        and that no man ever can,"
3809,75,
3810,75,"  i perceive nature, here in sight of the sea, is taking advantage of"
3811,75,"        me, to dart upon me, and sting me,"
3812,75,"  because i have dared to open my mouth, to sing at all,"
3813,75,
3814,75,  you oceans both! i close with you;
3815,75,"  we murmur alike reproachfully, rolling our sands and drift, knowing"
3816,75,"        not why,"
3817,75,"  these little shreds indeed, standing for you and me and all,"
3818,75,
3819,75,"  you friable shore, with trails of debris!                          "
3820,75,
3821,75,  you fish-shaped island! i take what is underfoot;
3822,75,"  what is yours is mine, my father,"
3823,75,
3824,75,"  i too paumanok,"
3825,75,"  i too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been wash'd"
3826,75,        on your shores;
3827,75,"  i too am but a trail of drift and debris,"
3828,75,"  i too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island,"
3829,75,
3830,75,"  i throw myself upon your breast, my father,"
3831,75,"  i cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,"
3832,75,"  i hold you so firm, till you answer me something,"
3833,75,
3834,75,"  kiss me, my father,                                                "
3835,75,
3836,75,"  touch me with your lips, as i touch those i love,"
3837,75,"  breathe to me, while i hold you close, the secret of the murmuring i"
3838,75,"        envy,"
3839,75,
3840,75,"  ebb, ocean of life, the flow will return,"
3841,75,"  cease not your moaning, you fierce old mother,"
3842,75,"  endlessly cry for your castaways--but fear not, deny not me,"
3843,75,"  rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet, as i touch you, or"
3844,75,"        gather from you,"
3845,75,
3846,75,"  i mean tenderly by you and all,"
3847,75,"  i gather for myself, and for this phantom, looking down where we"
3848,75,"        lead, and following me and mine,"
3849,75,
3850,75,  me and mine!
3851,75,"  we, loose winrows, little corpses,                                "
3852,75,
3853,75,"  froth, snowy white, and bubbles,"
3854,75,  see! from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last!
3855,75,"  see--the prismatic colors, glistening and rolling!"
3856,75,"  tufts of straw, sands, fragments,"
3857,75,"  buoy'd hither from many moods, one contradicting another,"
3858,75,"  from the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell;"
3859,75,"  musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil;"
3860,75,  up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown;
3861,75,"  a limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating,"
3862,75,        drifted at random;
3863,75,  just as much for us that sobbing dirge of nature;                  
3864,75,
3865,75,"  just as much, whence we come, that blare of the cloud-trumpets;"
3866,75,"  we, capricious, brought hither, we know not whence, spread out before"
3867,75,"        you,"
3868,75,"  you, up there, walking or sitting,"
3869,75,"  whoever you are--we too lie in drifts at your feet,"
3870,75,
3871,75,"  sea-raff! crook-tongued waves,"
3872,75,"  o, i will yet sing, some day, what you have said to me,"
3873,76,"who are you, dusky woman, so ancient, hardly human,"
3874,76,"  with your woolly-white and turban'd head, and bare bony feet?"
3875,76,"  why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?"
3876,76,
3877,76,"  'tis while our army lines carolina's sand and pines,"
3878,76,"  forth from thy hovel door, thou, ethiopia, com'st to me,"

3880,76,
3881,76,"  me, master, years a hundred, since from my parents sunder'd,"
3882,76,"  a little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught;"
3883,76,"  then hither me, across the sea, the cruel slaver brought,"
3884,76,
3885,76,"       no further does she say, but lingering all the day,                "
3886,76,
3887,76,"  her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,"
3888,76,"  and curtseys to the regiments, the guidons moving by,"
3889,76,
3890,76,"what is it, fateful woman--so blear, hardly human?"
3891,76,"  why wag your head, with turban bound--yellow, red and green?"
3892,76,"  are the things so strange and marvelous, you see or have seen?"
3893,77,"suddenly, out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,"
3894,77,"like lightning it le'pt forth, half startled at itself,"
3895,77,its feet upon the ashes and the rags--its hands tight to the throats
3896,77,"        of kings,"
3897,77,
3898,77,o hope and faith!
3899,77,o aching close of exiled patriots' lives!
3900,77,o many a sicken'd heart!
3901,77,"turn back unto this day, and make yourselves afresh,"
3902,77,
3903,77,"and you, paid to defile the people! you liars, mark!"
3904,77,"not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,"
3905,77,"for court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his"
3906,77,"        simplicity the poor man's wages,                            "
3907,77,
3908,77,"for many a promise sworn by royal lips, and broken, and laugh'd at in"

3910,77,"then in their power, not for all these, did the blows strike revenge,"
3911,77,        or the heads of the nobles fall;
3912,77,"the people scorn'd the ferocity of kings,"
3913,77,
3914,77,"but the sweetness of mercy brew'd bitter destruction, and the"
3915,77,        frighten'd monarchs come back;

3917,77,"soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant,"
3918,77,
3919,77,"yet behind all, lowering, stealing--lo, a shape,"
3920,77,"vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in"
3921,77,"        scarlet folds,"
3922,77,"whose face and eyes none may see,"
3923,77,"out of its robes only this--the red robes, lifted by the arm,      "
3924,77,
3925,77,"one finger, crook'd, pointed high over the top, like the head of a"
3926,77,"        snake appears,"

3930,77,"the rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are"
3931,77,"        flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,"
3932,77,"and all these things bear fruits--and they are good,"
3933,77,
3934,77,"those corpses of young men,"
3935,77,those martyrs that hang from the gibbets--those hearts pierc'd by the

4037,79,
4038,79,"and this is some murderer's knife, with a half-pull'd scabbard,"
4039,79,
4040,79,this face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee;
4041,79,"an unceasing death-bell tolls there,"
4042,79,
4043,79,those then are really men--the bosses and tufts of the great round
4044,79,        globe!
4045,79,
4046,79,"features of my equals, would you trick me with your creas'd and"
4047,79,        cadaverous march?
4048,79,"well, you cannot trick me,"
4049,79,
4050,79,"i see your rounded, never-erased flow;"
4051,79,"i see neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises,"
4052,79,
4053,79,splay and twist as you like--poke with the tangling fores of fishes
4054,79,        or rats;

4056,79,
4057,79,i saw the face of the most smear'd and slobbering idiot they had at
4058,79,        the asylum;
4059,79,and i knew for my consolation what they knew not;
4060,79,"i knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother,"
4061,79,the same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement;
4062,79,"and i shall look again in a score or two of ages,"
4063,79,"and i shall meet the real landlord, perfect and unharm'd, every inch"
4064,79,"        as good as myself,"
4065,79,
4066,79,"the lord advances, and yet advances;"
4067,79,always the shadow in front--always the reach'd hand bringing up the
4068,79,"        laggards,"
4069,79,
4070,79,out of this face emerge banners and horses--o superb! i see what is
4071,79,        coming;
4072,79,i see the high pioneer-caps--i see the staves of runners clearing the
4073,79,"        way,                                                        "
4074,79,
4075,79,"i hear victorious drums,"
4076,79,
4077,79,this face is a life-boat;
4078,79,"this is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no odds of the rest;"
4079,79,"this face is flavor'd fruit, ready for eating;"
4080,79,"this face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good,"
4081,79,
4082,79,"these faces bear testimony, slumbering or awake;"
4083,79,"they show their descent from the master himself,"
4084,79,
4085,79,"off the word i have spoken, i except not one--red, white, black, are"
4086,79,        all deific;

4090,79,
4091,79,"tall and sufficient stand behind, and make signs to me;"
4092,79,"i read the promise, and patiently wait,"
4093,79,
4094,79,"this is a full-grown lily's face,"
4095,79,"she speaks to the limber-hipp'd man near the garden pickets,"
4096,79,"come here, she blushingly cries--come nigh to me, limber-hipp'd man,"

4107,79,"        under them,"
4108,79,
4109,79,"i saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,"
4110,79,"i heard what the singers were singing so long,"

4117,79,
4118,79,"she sits in an arm-chair, under the shaded porch of the farmhouse,"

4128,79,"the justified mother of men,"
4129,80,"facing west, from california's shores,"
4130,80,"inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,"

4132,80,"        land of migrations, look afar,"

4138,80,now i face home again--very pleas'd and joyous;
4139,80,"but where is what i started for, so long ago?                    "

4170,84,
4171,84,"i walk'd the shores of my eastern sea,"
4172,84,"heard over the waves the little voice,"
4173,84,"saw the divine infant, where she woke, mournfully wailing, amid the"
4174,84,"        roar of cannon, curses, shouts, crash of falling buildings;"
4175,84,was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running--nor from the
4176,84,"        single corpses, nor those in heaps, nor those borne away in the"
4177,84,        tumbrels;
4178,84,was not so desperate at the battues of death--was not so shock'd at
4179,84,"        the repeated fusillades of the guns,"
4180,84,
4181,84,"pale, silent, stern, what could i say to that long-accrued"
4182,84,        retribution?
4183,84,could i wish humanity different?
4184,84,could i wish the people made of wood and stone?                    
4185,84,
4186,84,or that there be no justice in destiny or time?
4187,84,
4188,84,o liberty! o mate for me!
4189,84,"here too the blaze, the grape-shot and the axe, in reserve, to fetch"
4190,84,        them out in case of need;
4191,84,"here too, though long represt, can never be destroy'd;"
4192,84,"here too could rise at last, murdering and extatic;"
4193,84,"here too demanding full arrears of vengeance,"
4194,84,
4195,84,"hence i sign this salute over the sea,"
4196,84,"and i do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,"
4197,84,but remember the little voice that i heard wailing--and wait with
4198,84,"        perfect trust, no matter how long;"
4199,84,"and from to-day, sad and cogent, i maintain the bequeath'd cause, as"
4200,84,"        for all lands,                                              "
4201,84,
4202,84,"and i send these words to paris with my love,"
4203,84,"and i guess some chansonniers there will understand them,"
4204,84,for i guess there is latent music yet in france--floods of it;
4205,84,o i hear already the bustle of instruments--they will soon be
4206,84,        drowning all that would interrupt them;
4207,84,"o i think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,"
4208,84,"it reaches hither--it swells me to joyful madness,"
4209,84,"i will run transpose it in words, to justify it,"
4210,84,"i will yet sing a song for you, ma femme,"
4211,85,"from far dakota's cañons,"
4212,85,"lands of the wild ravine, the dusky sioux, the lonesome stretch, the"
4213,85,"        silence,"
4214,85,"haply to-day a mournful wail, haply a trumpet-note for heroes,"
4215,85,
4216,85,"the battle-bulletin,"
4217,85,"the indian ambuscade, the craft, the fatal environment,"
4218,85,"the cavalry companies fighting to the last in sternest heroism,"
4219,85,"in the midst of their little circle, with their slaughter'd horses"
4220,85,"        for breastworks,"
4221,85,"the fall of custer and all his officers and men,"
4222,85,
4223,85,"continues yet the old, old legend of our race,"
4224,85,"the loftiest of life upheld by death,                              "
4225,85,
4226,85,"the ancient banner perfectly maintain'd,"
4227,85,"o lesson opportune, o how i welcome thee!"
4228,85,"as sitting in dark days,"
4229,85,"lone, sulky, through the time's thick murk looking in vain for light,"
4230,85,"        for hope,"
4231,85,"from unsuspected parts a fierce and momentary proof,"
4232,85,"the sun there at the centre though conceal'd,"
4233,85,"electric life forever at the centre,"
4234,85,"breaks forth a lightning flash,"
4235,85,
4236,85,"thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle,"
4237,85,"i erewhile saw, with erect head, pressing ever in front, bearing a"
4238,85,"        bright sword in thy hand,                                    "
4239,85,
4240,85,"now ending well in death the splendid fever of thy deeds,"
4241,85,"i bring no dirge for it or thee, i bring a glad triumphal sonnet,"
4242,85,"desperate and glorious, aye in defeat most desperate, most glorious,"
4243,85,after thy many battles in which never yielding up a gun or a color
4244,85,"leaving behind thee a memory sweet to soldiers,"
4245,85,"thou yieldest up thyself,"
4246,86,"from my last years, last thoughts i here bequeath,"
4247,86,"scatter'd and dropt, in seeds, and wafted to the west,"
4248,86,"through moisture of ohio, prairie soil of illinois--through colorado,"
4249,86,"        california air,"
4250,86,"for time to germinate fully,"
4251,87,"from paumanock starting, i fly like a bird,"
4252,87,"around and around to soar, to sing the idea of all;"
4253,87,"to the north betaking myself, to sing there arctic songs,"
4254,87,"to kanada, till i absorb kanada in myself--to michigan then,"
4255,87,"to wisconsin, iowa, minnesota, to sing their songs, they are"
4256,87,        inimitable
4257,87,then to ohio and indiana to sing theirs--to missouri and kansas and
4258,87,"        arkansas, to sing theirs,"
4259,87,"to tennessee and kentucky--to the carolinas and georgia, to sing"
4260,87,"        theirs,"
4261,87,"to texas, and so along up toward california, to roam accepted"
4262,87,        everywhere;
4263,87,"to sing first, to the tap of the war-drum, if need be,"
4264,87,"the idea of all--of the western world, one and inseparable,        "
4265,87,
4266,87,"and then the song of each member of these states,"
4267,88,"from pent-up, aching rivers;"
4268,88,"from that of myself, without which i were nothing;"
4269,88,"from what i am determin'd to make illustrious, even if i stand sole"
4270,88,        among men;
4271,88,"from my own voice resonant--singing the phallus,"
4272,88,"singing the song of procreation,"
4273,88,"singing the need of superb children, and therein superb grown people,"
4274,88,"singing the muscular urge and the blending,"
4275,88,"singing the bedfellow's song, o resistless yearning!"
4276,88,"o for any and each, the body correlative attracting!"
4277,88,"o for you, whoever you are, your correlative body! o it, more than"
4278,88,"        all else, you delighting!                                  "
4279,88,
4280,88,--from the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day;
4281,88,from native moments--from bashful pains--singing them;
4282,88,"singing something yet unfound, though i have diligently sought it,"
4283,88,        many a long year;
4284,88,"singing the true song of the soul, fitful, at random;"
4285,88,"singing what, to the soul, entirely redeem'd her, the faithful one,"
4286,88,"        even the prostitute, who detain'd me when i went to the city;"
4287,88,singing the song of prostitutes;
4288,88,"renascent with grossest nature, or among animals;"
4289,88,"of that--of them, and what goes with them, my poems informing;"
4290,88,"of the smell of apples and lemons--of the pairing of birds,"
4291,88,"of the wet of woods--of the lapping of waves,                      "
4292,88,
4293,88,of the mad pushes of waves upon the land--i them chanting;
4294,88,the overture lightly sounding--the strain anticipating;
4295,88,the welcome nearness--the sight of the perfect body;
4296,88,"the swimmer swimming naked in the bath, or motionless on his back"
4297,88,        lying and floating;
4298,88,"the female form approaching--i, pensive, love-flesh tremulous,"
4299,88,        aching;
4300,88,"the divine list, for myself or you, or for any one, making;"
4301,88,"the face--the limbs--the index from head to foot, and what it"
4302,88,        arouses;
4303,88,the mystic deliria--the madness amorous--the utter abandonment;
4304,88,"hark close, and still, what i now whisper to you,"
4305,88,"i love you---o you entirely possess me,"
4306,88,
4307,88,"o i wish that you and i escape from the rest, and go utterly off--o"
4308,88,"        free and lawless,"
4309,88,two hawks in the air--two fishes swimming in the sea not more lawless
4310,88,        than we
4311,88,--the furious storm through me careering--i passionately trembling;
4312,88,the oath of the inseparableness of two together--of the woman that
4313,88,"        loves me, and whom i love more than my life--that oath"
4314,88,        swearing;
4315,88,"o i willingly stake all, for you!"
4316,88,"o let me be lost, if it must be so!"
4317,88,o you and i--what is it to us what the rest do or think?
4318,88,"what is all else to us? only that we enjoy each other, and exhaust"
4319,88,"        each other, if it must be s"
4320,88,--from the master--the pilot i yield the vessel to;
4321,88,"the general commanding me, commanding all--from him permission"
4322,88,        taking;                                                      
4323,88,
4324,88,"from time the programme hastening, i have loiter'd too long, as it"
4325,88,        is
4326,88,from sex--from the warp and from the woof;
4327,88,"to talk to the perfect girl who understands me,"
4328,88,to waft to her these from my own lips--to effuse them from my own
4329,88,        body
4330,88,from privacy--from frequent repinings alone;
4331,88,"from plenty of persons near, and yet the right person not near;"
4332,88,"from the soft sliding of hands over me, and thrusting of fingers"
4333,88,        through my hair and beard;
4334,88,from the long sustain'd kiss upon the mouth or bosom;
4335,88,"from the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk, fainting with"
4336,88,        excess;
4337,88,from what the divine husband knows--from the work of fatherhood;  
4338,88,
4339,88,"from exultation, victory, and relief--from the bedfellow's embrace in"
4340,88,        the night;

4342,88,"from the cling of the trembling arm,"
4343,88,"from the bending curve and the clinch,"
4344,88,"from side by side, the pliant coverlid off-throwing,"
4345,88,from the one so unwilling to have me leave--and me just as unwilling
4346,88,"        to leave,"
4347,88,"yet a moment, o tender waiter, and i return"
4348,88,"--from the hour of shining stars and dropping dews,"

4708,105,"singing, with open mouths, their strong melodious songs,"
4709,106,i hear it was charged against me that i sought to destroy
4710,106,        institutions;
4711,106,but really i am neither for nor against institutions;
4712,106,what indeed have i in common with them?--or what with the
4713,106,        destruction of them?
4714,106,"only i will establish in the mannahatta, and in every city of these"
4715,106,"        states, inland and seaboard,"
4716,106,"and in the fields and woods, and above every keel, little or large,"

4721,107,        pass'd the church;
4722,107,"winds of autumn!--as i walk'd the woods at dusk, i heard your long-"
4723,107,"        stretch'd sighs, up above, so mournful;"
4724,107,"i heard the perfect italian tenor, singing at the opera--i heard the"
4725,107,        soprano in the midst of the quartet singing;
4726,107,", heart of my love!--you too i heard, murmuring low, through one of"
4727,107,        the wrists around my head;
4728,107,"heard the pulse of you, when all was still, ringing little bells last"
4729,107,"        night under my ear,"
4730,108,"i saw in louisiana a live-oak growing,"
4731,108,"all alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the branches;"
4732,108,"without any companion it grew there, uttering joyous leaves of dark"
4733,108,"        green,"
4734,108,"and its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself;"
4735,108,"but i wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves, standing alone"
4736,108,"        there, without its friend, its lover near--for i knew i could"
4737,108,        not;
4738,108,"and i broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and"
4739,108,"        twined around it a little moss,"
4740,108,and brought it away--and i have placed it in sight in my room;
4741,108,"it is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,"
4742,108,for i believe lately i think of little else than of them
4743,108,yet it remains to me a curious token--it makes me think of manly
4744,108,        love;                                                        
4745,108,
4746,108,"for all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in louisiana,"
4747,108,"        solitary, in a wide flat space,"
4748,108,"uttering joyous leaves all its life, without a friend, a lover, near,"
4749,108,"i know very well i could not,"
4750,109,i saw old general at bay;
4751,109,"old as he was, his grey eyes yet shone out in battle like stars"
4752,109,"his small force was now completely hemm'd in, in his works;"
4753,109,he call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines--a desperate
4754,109,        emergency;
4755,109,i saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks--but two or three
4756,109,        were selected;
4757,109,i saw them receive their orders aside--they listen'd with care--the
4758,109,        adjutant was very grave;
4759,109,"i saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives,"
4760,110,i sing the body electric;

4762,110,"they will not let me off till i go with them, respond to them,"
4763,110,"and discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the"
4764,110,"        soul,"
4765,110,
4766,110,was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal
4767,110,        themselves;
4768,110,and if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the
4769,110,        dead?

4776,110,
4777,110,the expression of the face balks account;
4778,110,but the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face;
4779,110,"it is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of"
4780,110,        his hips and wrists;
4781,110,"it is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist"
4782,110,        and knees--dress does not hide him;
4783,110,"the strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton"
4784,110,        and flannel;
4785,110,"to see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more;"
4786,110,"you linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-"
4787,110,"        side,"
4788,110,
4789,110,"the sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the"

5328,125,"  the scenery of the snows, the winds' free orchestra,"
5329,125,"  the stretching, light-hung roof of clouds--the clear cerulean, and"
5330,125,"        the bulging, silvery fringes,"
5331,125,"  the high dilating stars, the placid, beckoning stars,"
5332,125,"  the moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,"
5333,125,"  the shows of all the varied lands, and all the growths and products,"
5334,125,
5335,125,"  fecund america! to-day,"
5336,125,  thou art all over set in births and joys!
5337,125,  thou groan'st with riches! thy wealth clothes thee as with a swathing
5338,125,        garment!                                                    
5339,125,
5340,125,  thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions!
5341,125,"  a myriad-twining life, like interlacing vines, binds all thy vast"
5342,125,        demesne!
5343,125,"  as some huge ship, freighted to water's edge, thou ridest into port!"
5344,125,"  as rain falls from the heaven, and vapors rise from earth, so have"
5345,125,"        the precious values fallen upon thee, and risen out of thee!"
5346,125,  thou envy of the globe! thou miracle!
5347,125,"  thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty!"
5348,125,  thou lucky mistress of the tranquil barns!
5349,125,"  thou prairie dame that sittest in the middle, and lookest out upon"
5350,125,"        thy world, and lookest east, and lookest west!"
5351,125,"  dispensatress, that by a word givest a thousand miles--that giv'st a"
5352,125,"        million farms, and missest nothing!"
5353,125,"  thou all-acceptress--thou hospitable--thou only art hospitable, as"
5354,125,"        god is hospitable,                                          "
5355,125,
5356,125,"  when late i sang, sad was my voice;"
5357,125,"  sad were the shows around me, with deafening noises of hatred, and"
5358,125,        smoke of conflict;
5359,125,"  in the midst of the armies, the heroes, i stood,"
5360,125,"  or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying,"
5361,125,
5362,125,"  but now i sing not war,"
5363,125,"  nor the measur'd march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,"
5364,125,"  nor the regiments hastily coming up, deploying in line of battle,"
5365,125,
5366,125,  no more the dead and wounded;
5367,125,"  no more the sad, unnatural shows of war,"
5368,125,
5369,125,  ask'd room those flush'd immortal ranks? the first forth-stepping
5370,125,        armies?                                                      
5371,125,
5372,125,"  ask room, alas, the ghastly ranks--the armies dread that follow'd,"
5373,125,
5374,125,"  pass--pass, ye proud brigades!"
5375,125,"  so handsome, dress'd in blue--with your tramping, sinewy legs;"
5376,125,  with your shoulders young and strong--with your knapsacks and your
5377,125,        muskets;
5378,125,"  --how elate i stood and watch'd you, where, starting off, you"
5379,125,        march'd!
5380,125,
5381,125,"  pass;--then rattle, drums, again!"
5382,125,"  scream, you steamers on the river, out of whistles loud and shrill,"
5383,125,        your salutes!
5384,125,  for an army heaves in sight--o another gathering army!
5385,125,"  swarming, trailing on the rear--o you dread, accruing army!"
5386,125,"  o you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea! with your"
5387,125,        fever!                                                      
5388,125,
5389,125,  o my land's maimed darlings! with the plenteous bloody bandage and
5390,125,        the crutch!
5391,125,  lo! your pallid army follow'd!
5392,125,
5393,125,"  but on these days of brightness,"
5394,125,"  on the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes, the"
5395,125,"        high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns,"
5396,125,  shall the dead intrude?
5397,125,
5398,125,"  ah, the dead to me mar not--they fit well in nature;"
5399,125,"  they fit very well in the landscape, under the trees and grass,"
5400,125,"  and along the edge of the sky, in the horizon's far margin,"
5401,125,
5402,125,"  nor do i forget you, departed;"
5403,125,"  nor in winter or summer, my lost ones;                            "
5404,125,
5405,125,"  but most, in the open air, as now, when my soul is rapt and at"
5406,125,"        peace--like pleasing phantoms,"
5407,125,"  your dear memories, rising, glide silently by me,"
5408,125,
5409,125,"  i saw the day, the return of the heroes;"
5410,125,"  yet the heroes never surpass'd, shall never return;"
5411,125,"  them, that day, i saw not,"
5412,125,
5413,125,"  i saw the interminable corps--i saw the processions of armies,"
5414,125,"  i saw them approaching, defiling by, with divisions,"
5415,125,"  streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of"
5416,125,"        mighty camps,"
5417,125,
5418,125,"  no holiday soldiers!--youthful, yet veterans;"
5419,125,"  worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and"
5420,125,"        workshop,"
5421,125,"  harden'd of many a long campaign and sweaty march,                "
5422,125,
5423,125,"  inured on many a hard-fought, bloody field,"
5424,125,
5425,125,  a pause--the armies wait;
5426,125,"  a million flush'd, embattled conquerors wait;"
5427,125,"  the world, too, waits--then, soft as breaking night, and sure as"
5428,125,"        dawn,"
5429,125,"  they melt--they disappear,"
5430,125,
5431,125,"  exult, indeed, o lands! victorious lands!"
5432,125,"  not there your victory, on those red, shuddering fields;"
5433,125,"  but here and hence your victory,"
5434,125,
5435,125,"  melt, melt away, ye armies! disperse, ye blue-clad soldiers!"
5436,125,"  resolve ye back again--give up, for good, your deadly arms;        "
5437,125,
5438,125,"  other the arms, the fields henceforth for you, or south or north, or"
5439,125,"        east or west,"
5440,125,"  with saner wars--sweet wars--life-giving wars,"
5441,125,
5442,125,"  loud, o my throat, and clear, o soul!"
5443,125,"  the season of thanks, and the voice of full-yielding;"
5444,125,"  the chant of joy and power for boundless fertility,"
5445,125,
5446,125,  all till'd and untill'd fields expand before me;
5447,125,"  i see the true arenas of my race--or first, or last,"
5448,125,"  man's innocent and strong arenas,"
5449,125,
5450,125,  i see the heroes at other toils;
5451,125,"  i see, well-wielded in their hands, the better weapons,          "
5452,125,
5453,125,"  i see where america, mother of all,"
5454,125,"  well-pleased, with full-spanning eye, gazes forth, dwells long,"
5455,125,"  and counts the varied gathering of the products,"
5456,125,
5457,125,"  busy the far, the sunlit panorama;"
5458,125,"  prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the north,"
5459,125,"  cotton and rice of the south, and louisianian cane;"
5460,125,"  open, unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,"
5461,125,"  kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,"
5462,125,"  and many a stately river flowing, and many a jocund brook,"
5463,125,"  and healthy uplands with their herby-perfumed breezes,            "
5464,125,
5465,125,"  and the good green grass--that delicate miracle, the ever-recurring"
5466,125,"        grass,"
5467,125,
5468,125,"  toil on, heroes! harvest the products!"
5469,125,"  not alone on those warlike fields, the mother of all,"
5470,125,"  with dilated form and lambent eyes, watch'd you,"
5471,125,
5472,125,"  toil on, heroes! toil well! handle the weapons well!"
5473,125,"  the mother of all--yet here, as ever, she watches you,"
5474,125,
5475,125,"  well-pleased, america, thou beholdest,"
5476,125,"  over the fields of the west, those crawling monsters,"
5477,125,"  the human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements,"
5478,125,"  beholdest, moving in every direction, imbued as with life, the"
5479,125,"        revolving hay-rakes,                                        "
5480,125,
5481,125,"  the steam-power reaping-machines, and the horse-power machines,"
5482,125,"  the engines, thrashers of grain, and cleaners of grain, well"
5483,125,        separating the straw--the nimble work of the patent pitch-fork;
5484,125,"  beholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the rice-"
5485,125,"        cleanser,"
5486,125,
5487,125,"  beneath thy look, o maternal,"
5488,125,"  with these, and else, and with their own strong hands, the heroes"
5489,125,"        harvest,"
5490,125,
5491,125,"  all gather, and all harvest;"
5492,125,"  yet but for thee, o powerful! not a scythe might swing, as now, in"
5493,125,        security;
5494,125,"  not a maize-stalk dangle, as now, its silken tassels in peace,"
5495,125,
5496,125,"  under thee only they harvest--even but a wisp of hay, under thy great"
5497,125,"        face, only;"
5498,125,"  harvest the wheat of ohio, illinois, wisconsin--every barbed spear,"
5499,125,        under thee;                                                
5500,125,
5501,125,"  harvest the maize of missouri, kentucky, tennessee--each ear in its"
5502,125,"        light-green sheath,"
5503,125,"  gather the hay to its myriad mows, in the odorous, tranquil barns,"
5504,125,"  oats to their bins--the white potato, the buckwheat of michigan, to"
5505,125,        theirs;
5506,125,  gather the cotton in mississippi or alabama--dig and hoard the
5507,125,"        golden, the sweet potato of georgia and the carolinas,"
5508,125,"  clip the wool of california or pennsylvania,"
5509,125,"  cut the flax in the middle states, or hemp, or tobacco in the"
5510,125,"        borders,"
5511,125,"  pick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees, or bunches"
5512,125,"        of grapes from the vines,"
5513,125,"  or aught that ripens in all these states, or north or south,"
5514,125,"  under the beaming sun, and under thee,"
5515,126,there are who teach only the sweet lessons of peace and safety;
5516,126,"but i teach lessons of war and death to those i love,"
5517,126,"that they readily meet invasions, when they come,"
5518,127,lo! victress on the peaks!
5519,127,"where thou, with mighty brow, regarding the world,"
5520,127,"the world, o libertad, that vainly conspired against thee"
5521,127,"out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all;"
5522,127,"dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,"
5523,127,"flauntest now unharm'd, in immortal soundness and bloom--lo! in these"
5524,127,"        hours supreme,"
5525,127,"no poem proud, i, chanting, bring to thee--nor mastery's rapturous"
5526,127,        verse;
5527,127,"but a book, containing night's darkness, and blood-dripping wounds,"
5528,127,"and psalms of the dead,"
5529,128,"locations and times--what is it in me that meets them all, whenever"
5530,128,"        and wherever, and makes me at home?"
5531,128,"forms, colors, densities, odors--what is it in me that corresponds"
5532,128,        with them?
5533,129,long i thought that knowledge alone would suffice me--o if i could
5534,129,        but obtain knowledge!
5535,129,"then my lands engrossed me--lands of the prairies, ohio's land, the"
5536,129,"        southern savannas, engrossed me--for them i would live--i would"
5537,129,        be their orator;
5538,129,"then i met the examples of old and new heroes--i heard of warriors,"
5539,129,"        sailors, and all dauntless persons--and it seemed to me that i"
5540,129,        too had it in me to be as dauntless as any--and would be so;
5541,129,"and then, to enclose all, it came to me to strike up the songs of the"
5542,129,        new world--and then i believed my life must be spent in
5543,129,        singing;
5544,129,"but now take notice, land of the prairies, land of the south"
5545,129,"        savannas, ohio's land,"
5546,129,"take notice, you kanuck woods--and you lake huron--and all that with"
5547,129,"        you roll toward niagara--and you niagara also,"
5548,129,"and you, californian mountains--that you each and all find somebody"
5549,129,"        else to be your singer of songs,"
5550,129,for i can be your singer of songs no longer--one who loves me is
5551,129,"        jealous of me, and withdraws me from all but love,"
5552,129,with the rest i dispense--i sever from what i thought would suffice
5553,129,"        me, for it does not--it is now empty and tasteless to me,"
5554,129,"i heed knowledge, and the grandeur of the states, and the example of"
5555,129,"        heroes, no more,                                            "
5556,129,
5557,129,"i am indifferent to my own songs--i will go with him i love,"
5558,129,it is to be enough for us that we are together--we never separate
5559,129,"        again,"
5560,130,"long, too long america,"
5561,130,"traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn'd from joys and prosperity only,"
5562,130,"but now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish, advancing, grappling with direst fate and recoiling not,"
5563,130,"and now to conceive and show to the world what your children en-masse really are,"
5564,130,for who except myself has yet conceiv'd what your children en-masse really are?
5565,131,"look down, fair moon, and bathe this scene;"
5566,131,"pour softly down night's nimbus floods, on faces ghastly, swollen,"
5567,131,        purple;
5568,131,"on the dead, on their backs, with their arms toss'd wide,"
5569,131,"pour down your unstinted nimbus, sacred moon,"
5570,132,"manhatten's streets i saunter'd, pondering,"
5571,132,"  on time, space, reality--on such as these, and abreast with them,"
5572,132,"        prudence,"
5573,132,
5574,132,"  after all, the last explanation remains to be made about prudence;"
5575,132,  little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that
5576,132,"        suits immortality,"
5577,132,
5578,132,  the soul is of itself;
5579,132,  all verges to it--all has reference to what ensues;
5580,132,"  all that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence;"
5581,132,"  not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day,"
5582,132,"        month, any part of the direct life-time, or the hour of death,"
5583,132,        but the same affects him or her onward afterward through the
5584,132,"        indirect life-time,"
5585,132,
5586,132,"  the indirect is just as much as the direct,"
5587,132,  the spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the
5588,132,"        body, if not more,                                          "
5589,132,
5590,132,"  not one word or deed--not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of"
5591,132,"        the onanist, putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation,"
5592,132,"        cunning, betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution, but has"
5593,132,"        results beyond death, as really as before death,"
5594,132,
5595,132,"  charity and personal force are the only investments worth anything,"
5596,132,
5597,132,"  no specification is necessary--all that a male or female does, that"
5598,132,"        is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or"
5599,132,"        her, in the unshakable order of the universe, and through the"
5600,132,"        whole scope of it forever,"
5601,132,
5602,132,"  who has been wise, receives interest,"

5610,132,"  all the brave actions of war and peace,"
5611,132,"  all help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful,"
5612,132,"        young children, widows, the sick, and to shunn'd persons,"
5613,132,"  all furtherance of fugitives, and of the escape of slaves,        "
5614,132,
5615,132,"  all self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others"
5616,132,"        fill the seats of the boats,"
5617,132,"  all offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a"
5618,132,"        friend's sake, or opinion's sake,"
5619,132,"  all pains of enthusiasts, scoff'd at by their neighbors,"
5620,132,"  all the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,"
5621,132,"  all honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,"
5622,132,  all the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we

5627,132,"  all suggestions of the divine mind of man, or the divinity of his"
5628,132,"        mouth, or the shaping of his great hands;"
5629,132,  all that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe--
5630,132,"        or on any of the wandering stars, or on any of the fix'd stars,"
5631,132,        by those there as we are here;

6015,149,"        buy,"
6016,149,"the best farms--others toiling and planting, and he unavoidably"

6028,149,"        sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest"
6029,149,"        never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them,      "

6048,149,
6049,149,his welcome is universal--the flow of beauty is not more welcome or

6275,159,"or if it be distributed to the winds, i shall be satisfied,"
6276,160,"of the terrible doubt of appearances,"
6277,160,"of the uncertainty after all--that we may be deluded,"
6278,160,"that may-be reliance and hope are but speculations after all,"
6279,160,"that may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,"
6280,160,"may-be the things i perceive--the animals, plants, men, hills,"
6281,160,"        shining and flowing waters,"
6282,160,"the skies of day and night--colors, densities, forms--may-be these"
6283,160,"        are, as doubtless they are, only apparitions, and the real"
6284,160,        something has yet to be known;
6285,160,"how often they dart out of themselves, as if to confound me and mock"
6286,160,        me!
6287,160,"how often i think neither i know, nor any man knows, aught of them"
6288,160,"may-be seeming to me what they are, as doubtless they indeed but"
6289,160,"        seem, as from my present point of view--and might prove, as"
6290,160,"        of course they would, naught of what they appear, or naught"
6291,160,"        any how, from entirely changed points of view;"
6292,160,"--to me, these, and the like of these, are curiously answer'd by my"
6293,160,"        lovers, my dear friends;                                    "
6294,160,
6295,160,"when he whom i love travels with me, or sits a long while holding me"
6296,160,"        by the hand,"
6297,160,"when the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason"
6298,160,"        hold not, surround us and pervade us,"
6299,160,then i am charged with untold and untellable wisdom--i am silent--i
6300,160,"        require nothing further,"
6301,160,"i cannot answer the question of appearances, or that of identity"
6302,160,        beyond the grave;
6303,160,"but i walk or sit indifferent--i am satisfied,"
6304,160,"he ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me,"
6305,161,of the visages of things--and of piercing through to the accepted
6306,161,        hells beneath;
6307,161,of ugliness--to me there is just as much in it as there is in
6308,161,        beauty--and now the ugliness of human beings is acceptable to
6309,161,        me;
6310,161,"of detected persons--to me, detected persons are not, in any respect,"
6311,161,        worse than undetected persons--and are not in any respect worse
6312,161,        than i am myself;
6313,161,"of criminals--to me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal--"
6314,161,"        and any reputable person is also--and the president is also,"
6315,162,"a thousand perfect men and women appear,"
6316,162,"around each gathers a cluster of friends, and gay children and"
6317,162,"        youths, with offerings,"
6318,163,"far hence, amid an isle of wondrous beauty,"
6319,163,"crouching over a grave, an ancient, sorrowful mother,"
6320,163,"once a queen--now lean and tatter'd, seated on the ground,"
6321,163,her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders;
6322,163,"at her feet fallen an unused royal harp,"
6323,163,long silent--she too long silent--mourning her shrouded hope and
6324,163,        heir;
6325,163,"of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow, because most full of"
6326,163,"        love,"
6327,163,
6328,163,"yet a word, ancient mother;"
6329,163,"you need crouch there no longer on the cold ground, with forehead"
6330,163,        between your knees;
6331,163,"o you need not sit there, veil'd in your old white hair, so"
6332,163,        dishevel'd;                                                  
6333,163,
6334,163,"for know you, the one you mourn is not in that grave;"
6335,163,"it was an illusion--the heir, the son you love, was not really dead;"
6336,163,"the lord is not dead--he is risen again, young and strong, in another"
6337,163,        country;
6338,163,"even while you wept there by your fallen harp, by the grave,"
6339,163,"what you wept for, was translated, pass'd from the grave,"
6340,163,"the winds favor'd, and the sea sail'd it,"
6341,163,"and now with rosy and new blood,"
6342,163,"moves to-day in a new country,"
6343,164,"on journeys through the states we start,"
6344,164,"ay, through the world--urged by these songs,"
6345,164,sailing henceforth to every land--to every sea
6346,164,"we, willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all,"
6347,164,
6348,164,"we have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves, and passing on,"
6349,164,"we have said, why should not a man or woman do as much as the"
6350,164,"        seasons, and effuse as much?"
6351,164,
6352,164,we dwell a while in every city and town;
6353,164,"we pass through kanada, the north-east, the vast valley of the"
6354,164,"        mississippi, and the southern states;"
6355,164,"we confer on equal terms with each of the states,"
6356,164,"we make trial of ourselves, and invite men and women to hear;      "
6357,164,
6358,164,"we say to ourselves, remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the body"
6359,164,        and the soul;
6360,164,"dwell a while and pass on--be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic,"
6361,164,"and what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,"
6362,164,"and may be just as much as the seasons,"
6363,165,an old man's thought of school;
6364,165,"an old man, gathering youthful memories and blooms, that youth itself"
6365,165,"        cannot,"
6366,165,
6367,165,now only do i know you!
6368,165,o fair auroral skies! o morning dew upon the grass!
6369,165,
6370,165,"and these i see--these sparkling eyes,"
6371,165,"these stores of mystic meaning--these young lives,"
6372,165,"building, equipping, like a fleet of ships--immortal ships!"
6373,165,"soon to sail out over the measureless seas,"
6374,165,"on the soul's voyage,"
6375,165,
6376,165,only a lot of boys and girls?                                      
6377,165,
6378,165,"only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes?"
6379,165,only a public school?
6380,165,
6381,165,ah more--infinitely more;
6382,165,"as george fox rais'd his warning cry, is it this pile of brick and"
6383,165,"        mortar--these dead floors, windows, rails--you call the church?"
6384,165,"why this is not the church at all--the church is living, ever living"
6385,165,"        souls,"
6386,165,
6387,165,"and you, america,"
6388,165,cast you the real reckoning for your present?
6389,165,the lights and shadows of your future--good or evil?
6390,165,"to girlhood, boyhood look--the teacher and the school,"
6391,166,"on the beach, at night,"
6392,166,"stands a child, with her father,"
6393,166,"watching the east, the autumn sky,"
6394,166,
6395,166,"up through the darkness,"
6396,166,"while ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading,"
6397,166,"lower, sullen and fast, athwart and down the sky,"
6398,166,"amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east,"
6399,166,"ascends, large and calm, the lord-star jupiter;"
6400,166,"and nigh at hand, only a very little above,"
6401,166,"swim the delicate brothers, the pleiades,                          "
6402,166,
6403,166,"from the beach, the child, holding the hand of her father,"
6404,166,"those burial-clouds that lower, victorious, soon to devour all,"
6405,166,"watching, silently weeps,"
6406,166,
6407,166,"weep not, child,"
6408,166,"weep not, my darling,"
6409,166,with these kisses let me remove your tears;
6410,166,"the ravening clouds shall not long be victorious,"
6411,166,they shall not long possess the sky--shall devour the stars only in
6412,166,"        apparition,"
6413,166,jupiter shall emerge--be patient--watch again another night--the
6414,166,"        pleiades shall emerge,"
6415,166,"they are immortal--all those stars, both silvery and golden, shall"
6416,166,"        shine out again,                                            "
6417,166,
6418,166,the great stars and the little ones shall shine out again--they
6419,166,        endure;
6420,166,"the vast immortal suns, and the long-enduring pensive moons, shall"
6421,166,"        again shine,"
6422,166,
6423,166,"then, dearest child, mournest thou only for jupiter?"
6424,166,considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?
6425,166,
6426,166,"something there is,"
6427,166,"with my lips soothing thee, adding, i whisper,"
6428,166,"i give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,"
6429,166,"something there is more immortal even than the stars,"
6430,166,"many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,"
6431,166,"something that shall endure longer even than lustrous jupiter,    "
6432,166,
6433,166,"longer than sun, or any revolving satellite,"
6434,166,"or the radiant brothers, the pleiades,"
6435,167,"on the beach at night alone,"
6436,167,"as the old mother sways her to and fro, singing her husky song,"
6437,167,as i watch the bright stars shining--i think a thought of the clef of
6438,167,"        the universes, and of the future,"
6439,167,
6440,167,"a vast similitude interlocks all,"
6441,167,"all spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,"
6442,167,"        comets, asteroids,"
6443,167,"all the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the"
6444,167,"        same,"

6448,167,"        different worlds,"
6449,167,"all gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes--the fishes, the"
6450,167,"        brutes,                                                      "
6451,167,
6452,167,all men and women--me also;

6458,167,"        forever span them, and compactly hold them, and enclose them,"
6459,168,"once i pass'd through a populous city, imprinting my brain, for"
6460,168,"        future use, with its shows, architecture, customs, and"
6461,168,        traditions;
6462,168,"yet now, of all that city, i remember only a woman i casually met"
6463,168,"        there, who detain'd me for love of me;"
6464,168,"day by day and night by night we were together,--all else has long"
6465,168,        been forgotten by me;
6466,168,"i remember, i say, only that woman who passionately clung to me;"
6467,168,again we wander--we love--we separate again;
6468,168,again she holds me by the hand--i must not go!
6469,168,"i see her close beside me, with silent lips, sad and tremulous,"
6470,169,one hour to madness and joy!
6471,169,o furious! o confine me not!
6472,169,what is this that frees me so in storms?
6473,169,what do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean?
6474,169,
6475,169,o to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man!
6476,169,o savage and tender achings!
6477,169,"i bequeath them to you, my children,"
6478,169,"i tell them to you, for reasons, o bridegroom and bride,"
6479,169,
6480,169,"o to be yielded to you, whoever you are, and you to be yielded to me,"
6481,169,             in defiance of the world!
6482,169,o to return to paradise! o bashful and feminine!
6483,169,
6484,169,o to draw you to me--to plant on you for the first time the lips of a
6485,169,             determin'd man!
6486,169,
6487,169,o the puzzle--the thrice-tied knot--the deep and dark pool! o all
6488,169,             untied and illumin'd!
6489,169,o to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last!
6490,169,"o to be absolv'd from previous ties and conventions--i from mine, and"
6491,169,             you from yours!
6492,169,o to find a new unthought-of nonchalance with the best of nature!
6493,169,o to have the gag remov'd from one's mouth!
6494,169,"o to have the feeling, to-day or any day, i am sufficient as i am!"
6495,169,
6496,169,o something unprov'd! something in a trance!
6497,169,o madness amorous! o trembling!
6498,169,o to escape utterly from others' anchors and holds!
6499,169,
6500,169,to drive free! to love free! to dash reckless and dangerous!
6501,169,to court destruction with taunts--with invitations!
6502,169,to ascend--to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me!
6503,169,to rise thither with my inebriate soul!
6504,169,"to be lost, if it must be so!"
6505,169,to feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom!

6507,170,"one song, america, before i go,"

6544,172,
6545,172,"of life immense in passion, pulse, and power,"

6601,175,"as the first volume of a tale perused and laid away, and this the"
6602,175,"        second,"
6603,175,"songs, ventures, speculations, presently to close,"
6604,175,"lingering a moment, here and now, to you i opposite turn,          "
6605,175,
6606,175,"as on the road, or at some crevice door, by chance, or open'd window,"
6607,175,"pausing, inclining, baring my head, you specially i greet,"
6608,175,"to draw and clench your soul, for once, inseparably with mine,"
6609,175,"then travel, travel on,"
6610,176,", out of the cradle endlessly rocking,"
6611,176,"  out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,"
6612,176,"  out of the ninth-month midnight,"
6613,176,"  over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child leaving his bed wander'd alone, bareheaded, barefoot,"
6614,176,"  down from the shower'd halo,"
6615,176,"  up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive,"
6616,176,"  out from the patches of briers and blackberries,"
6617,176,"  from the memories of the bird that chanted to me,"
6618,176,"  from your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and fallings i heard,"
6619,176," from under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as if with tears,"
6620,176," from those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist,"
6621,176," from the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,"
6622,176," from the myriad thence-arous'd words,"
6623,176," from the word stronger and more delicious than any,"
6624,176," from such as now they start the scene revisiting,"
6625,176," as a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,"
6626,176," borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,"
6627,176," a man, yet by these tears a little boy again,"
6628,176," throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,"
6629,176," i, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,"
6630,176," taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,"
6631,176," a reminiscence sing,"
6632,176,
6633,176," once paumanok,"
6634,176," when the lilac-scent was in the air and fifth-month grass was growing,"
6635,176," up this seashore in some briers,"
6636,176," two feather'd guests from alabama, two together,"
6637,176," and their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,"
6638,176," and every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,"
6639,176," and every day the she-bird crouch'd on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,"
6640,176," and every day i, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them,"
6641,176," cautiously peering, absorbing, translating,"
6642,176,
6643,176, shine! shine! shine!
6644,176," pour down your warmth, great sun!"
6645,176," while we bask, we two together,"
6646,176,
6647,176, two together!  
6648,176," winds blow south, or winds blow north,  "
6649,176," day come white, or night come black,  "
6650,176," home, or rivers and mountains from home,  "
6651,176," singing all time, minding no time,  "
6652,176," while we two keep together,  "
6653,176,
6654,176," till of a sudden,"
6655,176," may-be kill'd, unknown to her mate,"
6656,176," one forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the nest,"
6657,176," nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,"
6658,176," nor ever appear'd again,"
6659,176,
6660,176," and thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,"
6661,176," and at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,"
6662,176," over the hoarse surging of the sea,"
6663,176," or flitting from brier to brier by day,"
6664,176," i saw, i heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,"
6665,176," the solitary guest from alabama,"
6666,176,
6667,176, blow! blow! blow!  
6668,176, blow up sea-winds along paumanok's shore;  
6669,176," i wait and i wait till you blow my mate to me,  "
6670,176,
6671,176," yes, when the stars glisten'd,"
6672,176," all night long on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake,"
6673,176," down almost amid the slapping waves,"
6674,176," sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears,"
6675,176,
6676,176," he call'd on his mate,"
6677,176," he pour'd forth the meanings which i of all men know,"
6678,176,
6679,176," yes my brother i know,"
6680,176," the rest might not, but i have treasur'd every note,"
6681,176," for more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,"
6682,176," silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,"
6683,176," recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after their sorts,"
6684,176," the white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,"
6685,176," i, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,"
6686,176," listen'd long and long,"
6687,176,
6688,176," listen'd to keep, to sing, now translating the notes,"
6689,176," following you my brother,"
6690,176,
6691,176, soothe! soothe! soothe!
6692,176," close on its wave soothes the wave behind,"
6693,176," and again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close,"
6694,176," but my love soothes not me, not me,"
6695,176,
6696,176," low hangs the moon, it rose late,"
6697,176," it is lagging -- o i think it is heavy with love, with love,"
6698,176,
6699,176," o madly the sea pushes upon the land,"
6700,176," with love, with love,"
6701,176,
6702,176, o night! do i not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?
6703,176, what is that little black thing i see there in the white?
6704,176,
6705,176, loud! loud! loud!
6706,176," loud i call to you, my love!"
6707,176,
6708,176," high and clear i shoot my voice over the waves,"
6709,176," surely you must know who is here, is here,"
6710,176," you must know who i am, my love,"
6711,176,
6712,176, low-hanging moon!
6713,176, what is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?
6714,176," o it is the shape, the shape of my mate!"
6715,176," o moon do not keep her from me any longer,"
6716,176,
6717,176, land! land! o land!
6718,176," whichever way i turn, o i think you could give me my mate back again if you only would,"
6719,176," for i am almost sure i see her dimly whichever way i look,"
6720,176,
6721,176, o rising stars!
6722,176," perhaps the one i want so much will rise, will rise with some of you,"
6723,176,
6724,176, o throat! o trembling throat!
6725,176, sound clearer through the atmosphere!
6726,176," pierce the woods, the earth,"
6727,176," somewhere listening to catch you must be the one i want,"
6728,176,
6729,176, shake out carols!
6730,176," solitary here, the night's carols!"
6731,176, carols of lonesome love! death's carols!
6732,176," carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!"
6733,176, o under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea!
6734,176," o reckless despairing carols,"
6735,176,
6736,176, but soft! sink low!
6737,176," soft! let me just murmur,"
6738,176," and do you wait a moment you husky-nois'd sea,"
6739,176," for somewhere i believe i heard my mate responding to me,"
6740,176," so faint, i must be still, be still to listen,"
6741,176," but not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me,"
6742,176,
6743,176, hither my love!
6744,176, here i am! here!
6745,176," with this just-sustain'd note i announce myself to you,"
6746,176," this gentle call is for you my love, for you,"
6747,176,
6748,176," do not be decoy'd elsewhere,"
6749,176," that is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice,"
6750,176," that is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray,"
6751,176," those are the shadows of leaves,"
6752,176,
6753,176, o darkness! o in vain!
6754,176," o i am very sick and sorrowful,"
6755,176,
6756,176," o brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea!"
6757,176, o troubled reflection in the sea!
6758,176, o throat! o throbbing heart!
6759,176," and i singing uselessly, uselessly all the night,"
6760,176,
6761,176, o past! o happy life! o songs of joy!
6762,176," in the air, in the woods, over fields,"
6763,176, loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!
6764,176," but my mate no more, no more with me!"
6765,176," we two together no more,"
6766,176,
6767,176," the aria sinking,"
6768,176," all else continuing, the stars shining,"
6769,176," the winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,"
6770,176," with angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,"
6771,176," on the sands of paumanok's shore gray and rustling,"
6772,176," the yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea almost touching,"
6773,176," the boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the atmosphere dallying,"
6774,176," the love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously bursting,"
6775,176," the aria's meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,"
6776,176," the strange tears down the cheeks coursing,"
6777,176," the colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,"
6778,176," the undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,"
6779,176," to the boy's soul's questions sullenly timing, some drown'd secret hissing,"
6780,176," to the outsetting bard,"
6781,176,
6782,176," demon or bird! said the boy's soul,"
6783,176, is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?
6784,176," for i, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping, now i have heard you,"
6785,176," now in a moment i know what i am for, i awake,"
6786,176," and already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer, louder and more sorrowful than yours,"
6787,176," a thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, never to die,"
6788,176,
6789,176," o you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,"
6790,176," o solitary me listening, never more shall i cease perpetuating you,"
6791,176," never more shall i escape, never more the reverberations,"
6792,176," never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,"
6793,176," never again leave me to be the peaceful child i was before what there in the night,"
6794,176," by the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,"
6795,176," the messenger there arous'd, the fire, the sweet hell within,"
6796,176," the unknown want, the destiny of me,"
6797,176,
6798,176," o give me the clew! it lurks in the night here somewhere,"
6799,176," o if i am to have so much, let me have more!"
6800,176,
6801,176," a word then, for i will conquer it,"
6802,176," the word final, superior to all,"
6803,176," subtle, sent up -- what is it? -- i listen;"
6804,176," are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?"
6805,176, is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?
6806,176,
6807,176," whereto answering, the sea,"
6808,176," delaying not, hurrying not,"
6809,176," whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before day-break,"
6810,176,
6811,176," lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death,"
6812,176," and again death, death, death, death,"
6813,176," hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd child's heart,"
6814,176," but edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,"
6815,176," creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,"
6816,176," death, death, death, death, death,"
6817,176,
6818,176," which i do not forget,"
6819,176," but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,"
6820,176," that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanok's gray beach,"
6821,176," with the thousand responsive songs at random,"
6822,176," my own songs awaked from that hour,"
6823,176," and with them the key, the word up from the waves,"
6824,176," the word of the sweetest song and all songs,"
6825,176," that strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,"
6826,176," or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet garments, bending aside,"
6827,176," the sea whisper'd me,"
6828,177,"out of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently to me,"
6829,177,"whispering, i love you, before long i die,"
6830,177,"i have travel'd a long way, merely to look on you, to touch you,"
6831,177,"for i could not die till i once look'd on you,"
6832,177,"for i fear'd i might afterward lose you,"
6833,177,
6834,177,"now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe;"
6835,177,"return in peace to the ocean, my love;"
6836,177,"i too am part of that ocean, my love--we are not so much separated;"
6837,177,"behold the great rondure--the cohesion of all, how perfect!"
6838,177,"but as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,"
6839,177,
6840,177,"as for an hour, carrying us diverse--yet cannot carry us diverse for"
6841,177,               ever;
6842,177,"be not impatient--a little space--know you, i salute the air, the"
6843,177,"               ocean and the land,"
6844,177,"every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love,"
6845,178,"over the carnage rose prophetic a voice,"
6846,178,be not dishearten'd--affection shall solve the problems of freedom
6847,178,        yet;
6848,178,those who love each other shall become invincible--they shall yet
6849,178,"        make columbia victorious,"
6850,178,
6851,178,sons of the mother of all! you shall yet be victorious!
6852,178,you shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the
6853,178,"        earth,"
6854,178,
6855,178,no danger shall balk columbia's lovers;
6856,178,"if need be, a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one,"
6857,178,
6858,178,one from massachusetts shall be a missourian's comrade;
6859,178,"from maine and from hot carolina, and another, an oregonese, shall be"
6860,178,"        friends triune,"
6861,178,"more precious to each other than all the riches of the earth,      "
6862,178,
6863,178,"to michigan, florida perfumes shall tenderly come;"
6864,178,"not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death,"
6865,178,
6866,178,it shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly
6867,178,        affection;
6868,178,the most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly;
6869,178,"the dependence of liberty shall be lovers,"
6870,178,"the continuance of equality shall be comrades,"
6871,178,
6872,178,these shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron;
6873,178,"i, extatic, o partners! o lands! with the love of lovers tie you,"
6874,178,
6875,178,were you looking to be held together by the lawyers?
6876,178,or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms?                        
6877,178,
6878,178,"  --nay--nor the world, nor any living thing, will so cohere,"
6879,179,"singing my days,"
6880,179,"  singing the great achievements of the present,"
6881,179,"  singing the strong, light works of engineers,"
6882,179,"  our modern wonders, the antique ponderous seven outvied,"
6883,179,"  in the old world, the east, the suez canal,"
6884,179,"  the new by its mighty railroad spann'd,"
6885,179,"  the seas inlaid with eloquent, gentle wires,"
6886,179,"  i sound, to commence, the cry, with thee, o soul,"
6887,179,  the past! the past! the past!
6888,179,
6889,179,"  the past! the dark, unfathom'd retrospect!                        "
6890,179,
6891,179,  the teeming gulf! the sleepers and the shadows!
6892,179,  the past! the infinite greatness of the past!
6893,179,"  for what is the present, after all, but a growth out of the past?"
6894,179,"  as a projectile, form'd, impell'd, passing a certain line, still"
6895,179,"        keeps on,"
6896,179,"  so the present, utterly form'd, impell'd by the past,"
6897,179,
6898,179,"  passage, o soul, to india!"
6899,179,"  eclaircise the myths asiatic--the primitive fables,"
6900,179,
6901,179,"  not you alone, proud truths of the world!"
6902,179,"  nor you alone, ye facts of modern science!"
6903,179,"  but myths and fables of eld--asia's, africa's fables!              "
6904,179,
6905,179,  the far-darting beams of the spirit!--the unloos'd dreams!
6906,179,  the deep diving bibles and legends;
6907,179,  the daring plots of the poets--the elder religions;
6908,179,"  --o you temples fairer than lilies, pour'd over by the rising sun!"
6909,179,"  o you fables, spurning the known, eluding the hold of the known,"
6910,179,        mounting to heaven!
6911,179,"  you lofty and dazzling towers, pinnacled, red as roses, burnish'd"
6912,179,        with gold!
6913,179,"  towers of fables immortal, fashion'd from mortal dreams!"
6914,179,"  you too i welcome, and fully, the same as the rest;"

6918,179,
6919,179,"  lo, soul! seest thou not god's purpose from the first?"
6920,179,"  the earth to be spann'd, connected by net-work,"
6921,179,"  the people to become brothers and sisters,"
6922,179,"  the races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage,"
6923,179,"  the oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near,"
6924,179,"  the lands to be welded together,"
6925,179,
6926,179,"  a worship new, i sing;"
6927,179,"  you captains, voyagers, explorers, yours!"
6928,179,"  you engineers! you architects, machinists, your!"
6929,179,"  you, not for trade or transportation only,                        "
6930,179,
6931,179,"  but in god's name, and for thy sake, o soul,"
6932,179,
6933,179,  passage to india!
6934,179,"  lo, soul, for thee, of tableau's twain,"
6935,179,"  i see, in one, the suez canal initiated, open'd,"
6936,179,"  i see the procession of steamships, the empress eugenie's leading the"
6937,179,        van;
6938,179,"  i mark, from on deck, the strange landscape, the pure sky, the level"
6939,179,        sand in the distance;
6940,179,"  i pass swiftly the picturesque groups, the workmen gather'd,"
6941,179,"  the gigantic dredging machines,"
6942,179,
6943,179,"  in one, again, different, yet thine, all thine, o soul, the same,"
6944,179,"  i see over my own continent the pacific railroad, surmounting every"
6945,179,        barrier;                                                    
6946,179,
6947,179,"  i see continual trains of cars winding along the platte, carrying"
6948,179,        freight and passengers;
6949,179,"  i hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill steam-"
6950,179,"        whistle,"
6951,179,  i hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the
6952,179,        world;
6953,179,  i cross the laramie plains--i note the rocks in grotesque shapes--the
6954,179,        buttes;
6955,179,"  i see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions--the barren, colorless,"
6956,179,        sage-deserts;
6957,179,"  i see in glimpses afar, or towering immediately above me, the great"
6958,179,        mountains--i see the wind river and the wahsatch mountains;
6959,179,  i see the monument mountain and the eagle's nest--i pass the
6960,179,        promontory--i ascend the nevadas;
6961,179,"  i scan the noble elk mountain, and wind around its base;"
6962,179,"  i see the humboldt range--i thread the valley and cross the river,"
6963,179,  i see the clear waters of lake tahoe--i see forests of majestic
6964,179,"        pines,                                                      "
6965,179,
6966,179,"  or, crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, i behold"
6967,179,        enchanting mirages of waters and meadows;
6968,179,"  marking through these, and after all, in duplicate slender lines,"
6969,179,"  bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel,"
6970,179,"  tying the eastern to the western sea,"
6971,179,"  the road between europe and asia,"
6972,179,
6973,179,"  ah genoese, thy dream! thy dream!"
6974,179,"  centuries after thou art laid in thy grave,"
6975,179,  the shore thou foundest verifies thy dream!
6976,179,
6977,179,  passage to india!
6978,179,  struggles of many a captain--tales of many a sailor dead!          
6979,179,
6980,179,"  over my mood, stealing and spreading they come,"
6981,179,"  like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach'd sky,"
6982,179,
6983,179,"  along all history, down the slopes,"
6984,179,"  as a rivulet running, sinking now, and now again to the surface"
6985,179,"        rising,"
6986,179,"  a ceaseless thought, a varied train--lo, soul! to thee, thy sight,"
6987,179,"        they rise,"
6988,179,"  the plans, the voyages again, the expeditions,"
6989,179,  again vasco de gama sails forth;
6990,179,"  again the knowledge gain'd, the mariner's compass,"
6991,179,"  lands found, and nations born--thou born, america, a hemisphere"

6998,179,  cover'd all over with visible power and beauty!
6999,179,"  alternate light and day, and the teeming, spiritual darkness;"
7000,179,"  unspeakable, high processions of sun and moon, and countless stars,"
7001,179,        above;
7002,179,"  below, the manifold grass and waters, animals, mountains, trees;"
7003,179,"  with inscrutable purpose--some hidden, prophetic intention;"
7004,179,"  now, first, it seems, my thought begins to span thee,"

7007,179,"  adam and eve appear, then their myriad progeny after them,        "
7008,179,
7009,179,"  wandering, yearning, curious--with restless explorations,"
7010,179,"  with questionings, baffled, formless, feverish--with never-happy"
7011,179,"        hearts,"
7012,179,"  with that sad, incessant refrain, wherefore, unsatisfied soul? and"
7013,179,"        whither, o mocking life?"
7014,179,
7015,179,"  ah, who shall soothe these feverish children?"
7016,179,  who justify these restless explorations?
7017,179,  who speak the secret of impassive earth?
7018,179,"  who bind it to us? what is this separate nature, so unnatural?"
7019,179,"  what is this earth, to our affections? unloving earth, without a"
7020,179,        throb to answer ours;

7596,186,"  the voyage down the niagara, the st, lawrence,--the superb"
7597,186,"        scenery--the steamers,"
7598,186,"  the ships sailing--the thousand islands--the occasional timber-raft,"
7599,186,"        and the raftsmen with long-reaching sweep-oars,"
7600,186,"  the little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they cook"
7601,186,"        their supper at evening,"
7602,186,
7603,186,  o something pernicious and dread!
7604,186,  something far away from a puny and pious life!
7605,186,  something unproved! something in a trance!
7606,186,"  something escaped from the anchorage, and driving free,"
7607,186,
7608,186,"  o to work in mines, or forging iron!                              "
7609,186,
7610,186,  foundry casting--the foundry itself--the rude high roof--the ample
7611,186,"        and shadow'd space,"
7612,186,"  the furnace--the hot liquid pour'd out and running,"
7613,186,
7614,186,"  o to resume the joys of the soldier,"
7615,186,  to feel the presence of a brave general! to feel his sympathy!
7616,186,  to behold his calmness! to be warm'd in the rays of his smile!
7617,186,"  to go to battle! to hear the bugles play, and the drums beat!"
7618,186,  to hear the crash of artillery! to see the glittering of the bayonets
7619,186,        and musket-barrels in the sun!
7620,186,"  to see men fall and die, and not complain!"
7621,186,  to taste the savage taste of blood! to be so devilish!
7622,186,"  to gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy,              "
7623,186,
7624,186,  o the whaleman's joys! o i cruise my old cruise again!
7625,186,  i feel the ship's motion under me--i feel the atlantic breezes
7626,186,"        fanning me,"
7627,186,  i hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head--there--she blows!
7628,186,"  --again i spring up the rigging, to look with the rest--we see--we"
7629,186,"        descend, wild with excitement,"
7630,186,"  i leap in the lower'd boat--we row toward our prey, where he lies,"
7631,186,"  we approach, stealthy and silent--i see the mountainous mass,"
7632,186,"        lethargic, basking,"
7633,186,  i see the harpooneer standing up--i see the weapon dart from his
7634,186,"        vigorous arm,"
7635,186,"  o swift, again, now, far out in the ocean, the wounded whale,"
7636,186,"        settling, running to windward, tows me;"
7637,186,"  --again i see him rise to breathe--we row close again,"
7638,186,"  i see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd in the"
7639,186,"        wound,                                                      "
7640,186,

7642,186,"        fast,"
7643,186,"  as he rises, he spouts blood--i see him swim in circles narrower and"
7644,186,"        narrower, swiftly cutting the water--i see him die;"
7645,186,"  he gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then"
7646,186,"        falls flat and still in the bloody foam,"
7647,186,
7648,186,"  o the old manhood of me, my joy!"
7649,186,"  my children and grand-children--my white hair and beard,"
7650,186,"  my largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life,"
7651,186,
7652,186,  o the ripen'd joy of womanhood!
7653,186,  o perfect happiness at last!

7655,186,        the most venerable mother;
7656,186,  how clear is my mind! how all people draw nigh to me!            
7657,186,
7658,186,"  what attractions are these, beyond any before? what bloom, more than"
7659,186,        the bloom of youth?
7660,186,"  what beauty is this that descends upon me, and rises out of me?"
7661,186,
7662,186,  o the orator's joys!
7663,186,  to inflate the chest--to roll the thunder of the voice out from the
7664,186,"        ribs and throat,"
7665,186,"  to make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,"
7666,186,"  to lead america--to quell america with a great tongue,"

7668,186,  o the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself--receiving identity
7669,186,"        through materials, and loving them--observing characters, and"
7670,186,        absorbing them;
7671,186,"  o my soul, vibrated back to me, from them--from facts, sight,"
7672,186,"        hearing, touch, my phrenology, reason, articulation,"
7673,186,"        comparison, memory, and the like;"

7680,186,"        eyes which finally see,"
7681,186,"  nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,"
7682,186,"        embraces, procreates,"

7687,186,"  to rise at peep of day, and pass forth nimbly to work,"
7688,186,"  to plow land in the fall for winter-sown crops,"
7689,186,"  to plough land in the spring for maize,"
7690,186,"  to train orchards--to graft the trees--to gather apples in the fall,"
7691,186,
7692,186,  o the pleasure with trees!
7693,186,"  the orchard--the forest--the oak, cedar, pine, pekan-tree,        "
7694,186,
7695,186,"  the honey-locust, black-walnut, cottonwood, and magnolia,"
7696,186,
7697,186,  o death! the voyage of death!
7698,186,"  the beautiful touch of death, soothing and benumbing a few moments,"
7699,186,        for reasons;
7700,186,"  myself, discharging my excrementitious body, to be burn'd, or"
7701,186,"        render'd to powder, or buried,"
7702,186,"  my real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,"
7703,186,"  my voided body, nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,"
7704,186,"        further offices, eternal uses of the earth,"
7705,186,
7706,186,"  o to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore!"
7707,186,  to splash the water! to walk ankle-deep--to race naked along the
7708,186,"        shore,"
7709,186,
7710,186,  o to realize space!
7711,186,  the plenteousness of all--that there are no bounds;              
7712,186,
7713,186,"  to emerge, and be of the sky--of the sun and moon, and the flying"
7714,186,"        clouds, as one with them,"
7715,186,
7716,186,  o the joy of a manly self-hood!
7717,186,  personality--to be servile to none--to defer to none--not to any
7718,186,"        tyrant, known or unknown,"
7719,186,"  to walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,"
7720,186,"  to look with calm gaze, or with a flashing eye,"
7721,186,"  to speak with a full and sonorous voice, out of a broad chest,"
7722,186,  to confront with your personality all the other personalities of the
7723,186,"        earth,"

7733,186,        drinking?
7734,186,
7735,186,"  yet, o my soul supreme!"
7736,186,  know'st thou the joys of pensive thought?
7737,186,"  joys of the free and lonesome heart--the tender, gloomy heart?"
7738,186,  joy of the solitary walk--the spirit bowed yet proud--the suffering
7739,186,        and the struggle?
7740,186,"  the agonistic throes, the extasies--joys of the solemn musings, day"
7741,186,        or night?
7742,186,  joys of the thought of death--the great spheres time and space?
7743,186,"  prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals--the divine wife--the"
7744,186,"        sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?"
7745,186,"  joys all thine own, undying one--joys worthy thee, o soul,        "
7746,186,
7747,186,"  o, while i live, to be the ruler of life--not a slave,"
7748,186,"  to meet life as a powerful conqueror,"
7749,186,"  no fumes--no ennui--no more complaints, or scornful criticisms,"
7750,186,
7751,186,  o me repellent and ugly!
7752,186,"  to these proud laws of the air, the water, and the ground, proving my"
7753,186,"        interior soul impregnable,"
7754,186,"  and nothing exterior shall ever take command of me,"
7755,186,
7756,186,  o to attract by more than attraction!
7757,186,  how it is i know not--yet behold! the something which obeys none of
7758,186,"        the rest,"
7759,186,"  it is offensive, never defensive--yet how magnetic it draws,"
7760,186,
7761,186,  o joy of suffering!                                              
7762,186,
7763,186,  to struggle against great odds! to meet enemies undaunted!
7764,186,  to be entirely alone with them! to find how much one can stand!
7765,186,"  to look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, death, face to face!"
7766,186,  to mount the scaffold! to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect
7767,186,        nonchalance!
7768,186,  to be indeed a god!
7769,186,
7770,186,"  o, to sail to sea in a ship!"
7771,186,"  to leave this steady, unendurable land!"
7772,186,"  to leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the"
7773,186,        houses;
7774,186,"  to leave you, o you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,"
7775,186,"  to sail, and sail, and sail!                                      "
7776,186,
7777,186,  o to have my life henceforth a poem of new joys!
7778,186,"  to dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on,"
7779,186,"  to be a sailor of the world, bound for all ports,"
7780,186,"  a ship itself, see indeed these sails i spread to the sun and air,"
7781,186,"  a swift and swelling ship, full of rich words--full of joys,"
7782,187,"poets to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!"
7783,187,"not to-day is to justify me, and answer what i am for;"
7784,187,"but you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than"
7785,187,"        before known,"
7786,187,"arouse! arouse--for you must justify me--you must answer,"
7787,187,
7788,187,"i myself but write one or two indicative words for the future,"
7789,187,"i but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness,"
7790,187,
7791,187,"i am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a"
7792,187,"        casual look upon you, and then averts his face,"
7793,187,"leaving it to you to prove and define it,"
7794,187,"expecting the main things from you,"
7795,188,"what are those of the known, but to ascend and enter the unknown?"
7796,188,"  and what are those of life, but for death?"
7797,189,it was near the close of his indomitable and pious life--on his last voyage
7798,189,when nearly
7799,189,
7800,189,"years of age--that columbus, to save his two remaining ships"
7801,189,"from foundering in the caribbean sea in a terrible storm, had to run them"
7802,189,"ashore on the island of jamaica--where, laid up for a long and miserable"
7803,189,"year--1503--he was taken very sick, had several relapses, his men revolted,"
7804,189,"and death seem'd daily imminent; though he was eventually rescued, and sent"
7805,189,"home to spain to die, unrecognized, neglected and in want,,it is only"
7806,189,"ask'd, as preparation and atmosphere for the following lines, that the bare"
7807,189,"authentic facts be recall'd and realized, and nothing contributed by the"
7808,189,"fancy, see, the antillean island, with its florid skies and rich foliage"
7809,189,"and scenery, the waves beating the solitary sands, and the hulls of the"
7810,189,"ships in the distance, see, the figure of the great admiral, walking the"
7811,189,"beach, as a stage, in this sublimest tragedy--for what tragedy, what poem,"
7812,189,so piteous and majestic as the real scene?--and hear him uttering--as his
7813,189,"mystical and religious soul surely utter'd, the ideas following--perhaps,"
7814,189,"in their equivalents, the very words,"
7815,189,
7816,189,"  a batter'd, wreck'd old man,"
7817,189,"  thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home,"
7818,189,"  pent by the sea, and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary months,"
7819,189,"  sore, stiff with many toils, sicken'd, and nigh to death,"
7820,189,"  i take my way along the island's edge,"
7821,189,"  venting a heavy heart,"
7822,189,
7823,189,  i am too full of woe!
7824,189,"  haply, i may not live another day;"
7825,189,"  i can not rest, o god--i can not eat or drink or sleep,"
7826,189,"  till i put forth myself, my prayer, once more to thee,            "
7827,189,
7828,189,"  breathe, bathe myself once more in thee--commune with thee,"
7829,189,"  report myself once more to thee,"
7830,189,
7831,189,"  thou knowest my years entire, my life,"
7832,189,  my long and crowded life of active work--not adoration merely
7833,189,  thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth;
7834,189,  thou knowest my manhood's solemn and visionary meditations;
7835,189,"  thou knowest how, before i commenced, i devoted all to come to thee;"
7836,189,"  thou knowest i have in age ratified all those vows, and strictly kept"
7837,189,        them;
7838,189,  thou knowest i have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in thee;
7839,189,"  in shackles, prison'd, in disgrace, repining not,                "
7840,189,
7841,189,"  accepting all from thee--as duly come from thee,"
7842,189,
7843,189,"  all my emprises have been fill'd with thee,"
7844,189,"  my speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thoughts of thee,"
7845,189,"  sailing the deep, or journeying the land for thee;"
7846,189,"  intentions, purports, aspirations mine--leaving results to thee,"
7847,189,
7848,189,  o i am sure they really come from thee!
7849,189,"  the urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will,"
7850,189,"  the potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,"
7851,189,"  a message from the heavens, whispering to me even in sleep,"
7852,189,"  these sped me on,                                                  "
7853,189,
7854,189,"  by me, and these, the work so far accomplish'd for what has been,"
7855,189,        has been
7856,189,"  by me earth's elder, cloy'd and stifled lands, uncloy'd, unloos'd;"
7857,189,"  by me the hemispheres rounded and tied--the unknown to the known,"
7858,189,
7859,189,  the end i know not--it is all in thee;
7860,189,"  or small, or great, i know not--haply, what broad fields, what lands;"
7861,189,"  haply, the brutish, measureless human undergrowth i know,"
7862,189,"  transplanted there, may rise to stature, knowledge worthy thee;"
7863,189,  haply the swords i know may there indeed be turn'd to reaping-tools;
7864,189,  haply the lifeless cross i know--europe's dead cross--may bud and
7865,189,"        blossom there,"
7866,189,
7867,189,"  one effort more--my altar this bleak sand,                        "
7868,189,
7869,189,"  that thou, o god, my life hast lighted,"
7870,189,"  with ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of thee,"
7871,189,"  light rare, untellable--lighting the very light!"
7872,189,"  beyond all signs, descriptions, languages!"
7873,189,"  for that, o god--be it my latest word--here on my knees,"
7874,189,"  old, poor, and paralyzed--i thank thee,"
7875,189,
7876,189,"  my terminus near,"
7877,189,"  the clouds already closing in upon me,"
7878,189,"  the voyage balk'd--the course disputed, lost,"
7879,189,"  i yield my ships to thee,                                          "
7880,189,
7881,189,  steersman unseen! henceforth the helms are thine;
7882,189,  take thou command--what to my petty skill thy navigation?
7883,189,"  my hands, my limbs grow nerveless;"
7884,189,"  my brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd; let the old timbers part--i will"
7885,189,        not part!
7886,189,"  i will cling fast to thee, o god, though the waves buffet me;"
7887,189,"  thee, thee, at least, i know,"
7888,189,
7889,189,"  is it the prophet's thought i speak, or am i raving?"
7890,189,  what do i know of life? what of myself?
7891,189,"  i know not even my own work, past or present;                      "
7892,189,
7893,189,"  dim, ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me,"
7894,189,"  of newer, better worlds, their mighty parturition,"
7895,189,"  mocking, perplexing me,"
7896,189,
7897,189,  and these things i see suddenly--what mean they?
7898,189,"  as if some miracle, some hand divine unseal'd my eyes,"
7899,189,"  shadowy, vast shapes, smile through the air and sky,"
7900,189,"  and on the distant waves sail countless ships,"
7901,189,"  and anthems in new tongues i hear saluting me,"
7902,190,when lilacs last in the door-yard bloom'd
7903,190,
7904,190,"  when lilacs last in the door-yard bloom'd,"
7905,190,"  and the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night,"
7906,190,"  i mourn'd--and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring,"
7907,190,
7908,190,  o ever-returning spring! trinity sure to me you bring;

7914,190,  o great star disappear'd! o the black murk that hides the star!
7915,190,  o cruel hands that hold me powerless! o helpless soul of me!

7928,190,"  a sprig, with its flower, i break,"
7929,190,
7930,190,"  in the swamp, in secluded recesses,"
7931,190,"  a shy and hidden bird is warbling a song,"

7934,190,
7935,190,"  the hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,"
7936,190,"  sings by himself a song,"
7937,190,
7938,190,  song of the bleeding throat!
7939,190,"  death's outlet song of life--for well, dear brother, i know"
7940,190,"  if thou wast not gifted to sing, thou would'st surely die,"
7941,190,
7942,190,"  over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,"
7943,190,"  amid lanes, and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd"
7944,190,"        from the ground, spotting the gray debris"
7945,190,  amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes--passing the
7946,190,        endless grass;
7947,190,"  passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the"
7948,190,        dark-brown fields uprising;
7949,190,  passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards;    
7950,190,
7951,190,"  carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,"
7952,190,"  night and day journeys a coffin,"

7956,190,"  with the pomp of the inloop'd flags, with the cities draped in black,"
7957,190,"  with the show of the states themselves, as of crape-veil'd women,"
7958,190,"        standing,"
7959,190,"  with processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,"
7960,190,"  with the countless torches lit--with the silent sea of faces, and the"
7961,190,"        unbared heads,"

7963,190,"  with dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong"

7965,190,

7980,190,
7981,190,"  but mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,"
7982,190,"  copious, i break, i break the sprigs from the bushes;"
7983,190,"  with loaded arms i come, pouring for you,"
7984,190,"  for you, and the coffins all of you, o death,"
7985,190,
7986,190,"  o western orb, sailing the heaven!"
7987,190,"  now i know what you must have meant, as a month since we walk'd,"
7988,190,"  as we walk'd up and down in the dark blue so mystic,"
7989,190,"  as we walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,"
7990,190,"  as i saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after"
7991,190,"        night,"
7992,190,"  as you droop'd from the sky low down, as if to my side, while the"
7993,190,        other stars all look'd on                                  
7994,190,
7995,190,"  as we wander'd together the solemn night, for something, i know not"
7996,190,"        what, kept me from sleep"
7997,190,"  as the night advanced, and i saw on the rim of the west, ere you"
7998,190,"        went, how full you were of woe;"
7999,190,"  as i stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cold"
8000,190,"        transparent night,"
8001,190,  as i watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black of
8002,190,"        the night,"
8003,190,"  as my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad"
8004,190,"        orb,"
8005,190,"  concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone,"
8006,190,
8007,190,"  sing on, there in the swamp!"
8008,190,  o singer bashful and tender! i hear your notes--i hear your call;
8009,190,  i hear--i come presently--i understand you;
8010,190,  but a moment i linger--for the lustrous star has detain'd me;      
8011,190,
8012,190,"  the star, my departing comrade, holds and detains me,"
8013,190,
8014,190,  o how shall i warble myself for the dead one there i loved?
8015,190,  and how shall i deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?
8016,190,"  and what shall my perfume be, for the grave of him i love?"
8017,190,
8018,190,"  sea-winds, blown from east and west,"
8019,190,"  blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till"
8020,190,"        there on the prairies meeting,"
8021,190,"  these, and with these, and the breath of my chant,"
8022,190,"  i perfume the grave of him i love,"
8023,190,
8024,190,  o what shall i hang on the chamber walls?
8025,190,"  and what shall the pictures be that i hang on the walls,          "
8026,190,
8027,190,  to adorn the burial-house of him i love?
8028,190,
8029,190,"  pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,"
8030,190,"  with the fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and"
8031,190,"        bright,"
8032,190,"  with floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking"
8033,190,"        sun, burning, expanding the air;"
8034,190,"  with the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of"
8035,190,        the trees prolific;
8036,190,"  in the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a"
8037,190,        wind-dapple here and there;
8038,190,"  with ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky,"
8039,190,        and shadows;
8040,190,"  and the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of"
8041,190,"        chimneys,"
8042,190,"  and all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen"
8043,190,"        homeward returning,"
8044,190,
8045,190,  lo! body and soul! this land!                                      
8046,190,
8047,190,"  mighty manhattan, with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides,"
8048,190,        and the ships;
8049,190,  the varied and ample land--the south and the north in the light--
8050,190,"        ohio's shores, and flashing missouri,"
8051,190,"  and ever the far-spreading prairies, cover'd with grass and corn,"
8052,190,
8053,190,"  lo! the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty;"
8054,190,"  the violet and purple morn, with just-felt breezes;"
8055,190,"  the gentle, soft-born, measureless light;"
8056,190,"  the miracle, spreading, bathing all--the fulfill'd noon;"
8057,190,"  the coming eve, delicious--the welcome night, and the stars,"
8058,190,"  over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land,"
8059,190,
8060,190,"  sing on! sing on, you gray-brown bird!                            "
8061,190,
8062,190,"  sing from the swamps, the recesses--pour your chant from the bushes;"
8063,190,"  limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines,"
8064,190,
8065,190,"  sing on, dearest brother--warble your reedy song;"
8066,190,"  loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe,"
8067,190,
8068,190,"  o liquid, and free, and tender!"
8069,190,  o wild and loose to my soul! o wondrous singer!
8070,190,"  you only i hear,,yet the star holds me, but will soon depart"
8071,190,"  yet the lilac, with mastering odor, holds me,"
8072,190,
8073,190,"  now while i sat in the day, and look'd forth,"
8074,190,"  in the close of the day, with its light, and the fields of spring,"
8075,190,"        and the farmer preparing his crops,                        "
8076,190,
8077,190,"  in the large unconscious scenery of my land, with its lakes and"
8078,190,"        forests,"
8079,190,"  in the heavenly aerial beauty, after the perturb'd winds, and the"
8080,190,        storms
8081,190,"  under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the"
8082,190,"        voices of children and women,"
8083,190,"  the many-moving sea-tides,--and i saw the ships how they sail'd,"
8084,190,"  and the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy"
8085,190,"        with labor,"
8086,190,"  and the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its"
8087,190,        meals and minutia of daily usages;
8088,190,"  and the streets, how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent--"
8089,190,"        lo! then and there,"
8090,190,"  falling upon them all, and among them all, enveloping me with the"
8091,190,"        rest,"
8092,190,"  appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail;"
8093,190,"  and i knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death,"
8094,190,
8095,190,"  then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,"
8096,190,"  and the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,"
8097,190,"  and i in the middle, as with companions, and as holding the hands of"
8098,190,"        companions,"
8099,190,"  i fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not,"
8100,190,"  down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the"
8101,190,"        dimness,"
8102,190,"  to the solemn shadowy cedars, and ghostly pines so still,"
8103,190,
8104,190,  and the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me;
8105,190,"  the gray-brown bird i know, receiv'd us comrades three;"
8106,190,"  and he sang what seem'd the carol of death, and a verse for him i"
8107,190,"        love,"
8108,190,
8109,190,"  from deep secluded recesses,                                      "
8110,190,
8111,190,"  from the fragrant cedars, and the ghostly pines so still,"
8112,190,"  came the carol of the bird,"
8113,190,
8114,190,"  and the charm of the carol rapt me,"
8115,190,"  as i held, as if by their hands, my comrades in the night;"
8116,190,"  and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird,"
8117,190,
8118,190,"                            death carol,"
8119,190,
8120,190,"  come, lovely and soothing death,"
8121,190,"  undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,"
8122,190,"  in the day, in the night, to all, to each,"
8123,190,"  sooner or later, delicate death,"
8124,190,
8125,190,"  prais'd be the fathomless universe,                              "
8126,190,
8127,190,"  for life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious;"
8128,190,"  and for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!"
8129,190,"  for the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death,"
8130,190,
8131,190,"  dark mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,"
8132,190,  have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
8133,190,
8134,190,  then i chant it for thee--i glorify thee above all;
8135,190,"  i bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come"
8136,190,"        unfalteringly,"
8137,190,
8138,190,"  approach, strong deliveress!"
8139,190,"  when it is so--when thou hast taken them, i joyously sing the dead,"
8140,190,"  lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,                      "
8141,190,
8142,190,"  laved in the flood of thy bliss, o death,"
8143,190,
8144,190,"  from me to thee glad serenades,"
8145,190,"  dances for thee i propose, saluting thee--adornments and feastings"
8146,190,        for thee;
8147,190,"  and the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are"
8148,190,"        fitting,"
8149,190,"  and life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night,"
8150,190,
8151,190,"  the night, in silence, under many a star;"
8152,190,"  the ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice i know;"
8153,190,"  and the soul turning to thee, o vast and well-veil'd death,"
8154,190,"  and the body gratefully nestling close to thee,"
8155,190,
8156,190,  over the tree-tops i float thee a song!                          
8157,190,
8158,190,"  over the rising and sinking waves--over the myriad fields, and the"
8159,190,        prairies wide;
8160,190,"  over the dense-pack'd cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways,"
8161,190,"  i float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, o death!"
8162,190,
8163,190,"  to the tally of my soul,"
8164,190,"  loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,"
8165,190,"  with pure, deliberate notes, spreading, filling the night,"
8166,190,
8167,190,"  loud in the pines and cedars dim,"
8168,190,"  clear in the freshness moist, and the swamp-perfume;"
8169,190,"  and i with my comrades there in the night,"
8170,190,
8171,190,"  while my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,                "
8172,190,
8173,190,"  as to long panoramas of visions,"
8174,190,
8175,190,  i saw askant the armies;
8176,190,"  and i saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battle-flags;"
8177,190,"  borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierc'd with missiles, i"
8178,190,"        saw them,"
8179,190,"  and carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody;"
8180,190,"  and at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, and all in"
8181,190,"        silence,"
8182,190,"  and the staffs all splinter'd and broken,"
8183,190,
8184,190,"  i saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,"
8185,190,  and the white skeletons of young men--i saw them;
8186,190,  i saw the debris and debris of all the dead soldiers of the war;  
8187,190,
8188,190,  but i saw they were not as was thought;
8189,190,  they themselves were fully at rest--they suffer'd not;
8190,190,"  the living remain'd and suffer'd--the mother suffer'd,"
8191,190,"  and the wife and the child, and the musing comrade suffer'd,"
8192,190,"  and the armies that remain'd suffer'd,"
8193,190,
8194,190,"  passing the visions, passing the night;"
8195,190,"  passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands;"
8196,190,"  passing the song of the hermit bird, and the tallying song of my"
8197,190,"        soul,"
8198,190,"  victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying, ever-altering"
8199,190,"        song,"
8200,190,"  as low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding"
8201,190,"        the night,                                                  "
8202,190,
8203,190,"  sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again"
8204,190,"        bursting with joy,"
8205,190,"  covering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven,"
8206,190,"  as that powerful psalm in the night i heard from recesses,"
8207,190,"  passing, i leave thee, lilac with heart-shaped leaves;"
8208,190,"  i leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring,"
8209,190,  i cease from my song for thee;
8210,190,"  from my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with"
8211,190,"        thee,"
8212,190,"  o comrade lustrous, with silver face in the night,"
8213,190,
8214,190,"  yet each i keep, and all, retrievements out of the night;"
8215,190,"  the song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,              "
8216,190,
8217,190,"  and the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,"
8218,190,"  with the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of"
8219,190,"        woe,"
8220,190,"  with the lilac tall, and its blossoms of mastering odor;"
8221,190,"  with the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird,"
8222,190,"  comrades mine, and i in the midst, and their memory ever i keep--for"
8223,190,        the dead i loved so well;
8224,190,"  for the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands,and this for"
8225,190,        his dear sake;
8226,190,"  lilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul,"
8227,190,"  there in the fragrant pines, and the cedars dusk and dim,"
8228,191,"primeval my love for the woman i love,"
8229,191,"o bride! o wife! more resistless, more enduring than i can tell, the"
8230,191,        thought of you!
8231,191,"then separate, as disembodied, the purest born,"
8232,191,"the ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation,"
8233,191,"i ascend--i float in the regions of your love, o man,"
8234,191,"o sharer of my roving life,"
8235,192,proud music of the storm!
8236,192,"  blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies!"
8237,192,  strong hum of forest tree-tops! wind of the mountains!
8238,192,  personified dim shapes! you hidden orchestras!
8239,192,"  you serenades of phantoms, with instruments alert,"
8240,192,"  blending, with nature's rhythmus, all the tongues of nations;"
8241,192,  you chords left us by vast composers! you choruses!
8242,192,"  you formless, free, religious dances! you from the orient!"
8243,192,"  you undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts;"
8244,192,"  you sounds from distant guns, with galloping cavalry!              "
8245,192,
8246,192,"  echoes of camps, with all the different bugle-calls!"
8247,192,"  trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me powerless,"
8248,192,  entering my lonesome slumber-chamber--why have you seiz'd me?
8249,192,
8250,192,"  come forward, o my soul, and let the rest retire;"
8251,192,  listen--lose not--it is toward thee they tend;
8252,192,"  parting the midnight, entering my slumber-chamber,"
8253,192,"  for thee they sing and dance, o soul,"
8254,192,
8255,192,  a festival song!
8256,192,"  the duet of the bridegroom and the bride--a marriage-march,"
8257,192,"  with lips of love, and hearts of lovers, fill'd to the brim with"
8258,192,        love;                                                        
8259,192,
8260,192,"  the red-flush'd cheeks, and perfumes--the cortege swarming, full of"
8261,192,"        friendly faces, young and old,"
8262,192,"  to flutes' clear notes, and sounding harps' cantabile,"
8263,192,
8264,192,  now loud approaching drums!
8265,192,  victoria! see'st thou in powder-smoke the banners torn but flying?
8266,192,        the rout of the baffled?
8267,192,  hearest those shouts of a conquering army?
8268,192,
8269,192,"  ah, soul, the sobs of women--the wounded groaning in agony,"
8270,192,  the hiss and crackle of flames--the blacken'd ruins--the embers of
8271,192,"        cities,"
8272,192,"  the dirge and desolation of mankind,"
8273,192,
8274,192,  now airs antique and medieval fill me!
8275,192,"  i see and hear old harpers with their harps, at welsh festivals,  "
8276,192,
8277,192,"  i hear the minnesingers, singing their lays of love,"
8278,192,"  i hear the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the feudal ages,"
8279,192,
8280,192,"  now the great organ sounds,"
8281,192,"  tremulous--while underneath, as the hid footholds of the earth,"
8282,192,"  on which arising, rest, and leaping forth, depend,"
8283,192,"  all shapes of beauty, grace and strength--all hues we know,"
8284,192,"  green blades of grass, and warbling birds--children that gambol and"
8285,192,"        play--the clouds of heaven above,"
8286,192,"  the strong base stands, and its pulsations intermits not,"
8287,192,"  bathing, supporting, merging all the rest--maternity of all the rest;"
8288,192,"  and with it every instrument in multitudes,                        "
8289,192,
8290,192,"  the players playing--all the world's musicians,"
8291,192,"  the solemn hymns and masses, rousing adoration,"
8292,192,"  all passionate heart-chants, sorrowful appeals,"
8293,192,"  the measureless sweet vocalists of ages,"
8294,192,"  and for their solvent setting, earth's own diapason,"
8295,192,  of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves;
8296,192,  a new composite orchestra--binder of years and climes--ten-fold
8297,192,"        renewer,"
8298,192,"  as of the far-back days the poets tell--the paradiso,"
8299,192,"  the straying thence, the separation long, but now the wandering done,"
8300,192,"  the journey done, the journeyman come home,                        "
8301,192,
8302,192,"  and man and art, with nature fused again,"
8303,192,
8304,192,  tutti! for earth and heaven!
8305,192,"  the almighty leader now for me, for once has signal'd with his wand,"
8306,192,
8307,192,"  the manly strophe of the husbands of the world,"
8308,192,"  and all the wives responding,"
8309,192,
8310,192,  the tongues of violins!
8311,192,"  i think, o tongues, ye tell this heart, that cannot tell itself;"
8312,192,"  this brooding, yearning heart, that cannot tell itself,"
8313,192,
8314,192,"  ah, from a little child,"
8315,192,"  thou knowest, soul, how to me all sounds became music;            "
8316,192,
8317,192,"  my mother's voice, in lullaby or hymn;"
8318,192,  the voice--o tender voices--memory's loving voices!
8319,192,"  last miracle of all--o dearest mother's, sister's, voices"
8320,192,"  the rain, the growing corn, the breeze among the long-leav'd corn,"
8321,192,"  the measur'd sea-surf, beating on the sand,"
8322,192,"  the twittering bird, the hawk's sharp scream,"
8323,192,"  the wild-fowl's notes at night, as flying low, migrating north or"
8324,192,"        south,"
8325,192,"  the psalm in the country church, or mid the clustering trees, the"
8326,192,"        open air camp-meeting,"
8327,192,"  the fiddler in the tavern--the glee, the long-strung sailor-song,"
8328,192,"  the lowing cattle, bleating sheep--the crowing cock at dawn,      "
8329,192,
8330,192,"  all songs of current lands come sounding 'round me,"
8331,192,"  the german airs of friendship, wine and love,"
8332,192,"  irish ballads, merry jigs and dances--english warbles,"
8333,192,"  chansons of france, scotch tunes--and o'er the rest,"
8334,192,"  italia's peerless compositions,"
8335,192,
8336,192,"  across the stage, with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion,"
8337,192,"  stalks norma, brandishing the dagger in her hand,"
8338,192,
8339,192,  i see poor crazed lucia's eyes' unnatural gleam;
8340,192,"  her hair down her back falls loose and dishevell'd,"
8341,192,
8342,192,"  i see where ernani, walking the bridal garden,                    "
8343,192,
8344,192,"  amid the scent of night-roses, radiant, holding his bride by the"
8345,192,"        hand,"
8346,192,"  hears the infernal call, the death-pledge of the horn,"
8347,192,
8348,192,"  to crossing swords, and grey hairs bared to heaven,"
8349,192,"  the clear, electric base and baritone of the world,"
8350,192,  the trombone duo--libertad forever!
8351,192,
8352,192,"  from spanish chestnut trees' dense shade,"
8353,192,"  by old and heavy convent walls, a wailing song,"
8354,192,"  song of lost love--the torch of youth and life quench'd in despair,"
8355,192,"  song of the dying swan--fernando's heart is breaking,"
8356,192,
8357,192,"  awaking from her woes at last, retriev'd amina sings;              "
8358,192,
8359,192,"  copious as stars, and glad as morning light, the torrents of her joy,"
8360,192,
8361,192,  the teeming lady comes!
8362,192,"  the lustrious orb--venus contralto--the blooming mother,"
8363,192,"  sister of loftiest gods--alboni's self i hear,"
8364,192,
8365,192,"  i hear those odes, symphonies, operas;"
8366,192,"  i hear in the william tell, the music of an arous'd and angry people;"
8367,192,"  i hear meyerbeer's huguenots, the prophet, or robert;"
8368,192,"  gounod's faust, or mozart's don juan,"
8369,192,
8370,192,"  i hear the dance-music of all nations,"
8371,192,"  the waltz, some delicious measure, lapsing, bathing me in"
8372,192,        bliss                                                    
8373,192,
8374,192,"  the bolero, to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets,"
8375,192,
8376,192,"  i see religious dances old and new,"
8377,192,"  i hear the sound of the hebrew lyre,"
8378,192,"  i see the crusaders marching, bearing the cross on high, to the"
8379,192,        martial clang of cymbals;
8380,192,"  i hear dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers'd with frantic"
8381,192,"        shouts, as they spin around, turning always towards mecca;"
8382,192,  i see the rapt religious dances of the persians and the arabs;
8383,192,"  again, at eleusis, home of ceres, i see the modern greeks dancing,"
8384,192,"  i hear them clapping their hands, as they bend their bodies,"
8385,192,"  i hear the metrical shuffling of their feet,"
8386,192,
8387,192,"  i see again the wild old corybantian dance, the performers wounding"
8388,192,        each other;                                                
8389,192,
8390,192,"  i see the roman youth, to the shrill sound of flageolets, throwing"
8391,192,"        and catching their weapons,"
8392,192,"  as they fall on their knees, and rise again,"
8393,192,
8394,192,  i hear from the mussulman mosque the muezzin calling;
8395,192,"  i see the worshippers within, nor form, nor sermon, argument, nor"
8396,192,"        word,"
8397,192,"  but silent, strange, devout--rais'd, glowing heads--extatic faces,"
8398,192,
8399,192,"  i hear the egyptian harp of many strings,"
8400,192,  the primitive chants of the nile boatmen;
8401,192,"  the sacred imperial hymns of china,"
8402,192,"  to the delicate sounds of the king, the stricken wood and stone"
8403,192,"  or to hindu flutes, and the fretting twang of the vina,          "
8404,192,
8405,192,"  a band of bayaderes,"
8406,192,
8407,192,"  now asia, africa leave me--europe, seizing, inflates me;"
8408,192,"  to organs huge, and bands, i hear as from vast concourses of voices,"
8409,192,"  luther's strong hymn, eine feste burg ist unser gott;"
8410,192,  rossini's stabat mater dolorosa;
8411,192,"  or, floating in some high cathedral dim, with gorgeous color'd"
8412,192,"        windows,"
8413,192,"  the passionate agnus dei, or gloria in excelsis,"
8414,192,
8415,192,  composers! mighty maestros!
8416,192,"  and you, sweet singers of old lands--soprani! tenori! bassi!"
8417,192,"  to you a new bard, carolling free in the west,"
8418,192,"  obeisant, sends his love,                                        "
8419,192,
8420,192,"  such led to thee, o soul!"
8421,192,"  all senses, shows and objects, lead to thee,"
8422,192,"  but now, it seems to me, sound leads o'er all the rest,"
8423,192,
8424,192,"  i hear the annual singing of the children in st, paul's cathedral;"
8425,192,"  or, under the high roof of some colossal hall, the symphonies,"
8426,192,"        oratorios of beethoven, handel, or haydn;"
8427,192,"  the creation, in billows of godhood laves me,"
8428,192,
8429,192,"  give me to hold all sounds, i, madly struggling, cry,"
8430,192,"  fill me with all the voices of the universe,"
8431,192,"  endow me with their throbbings--nature's also,"
8432,192,"  the tempests, waters, winds--operas and chants--marches and"
8433,192,"        dances,                                                    "
8434,192,
8435,192,"  utter--pour in--for i would take them all,"
8436,192,
8437,192,"  then i woke softly,"
8438,192,"  and pausing, questioning awhile the music of my dream,"
8439,192,"  and questioning all those reminiscences--the tempest in its fury,"
8440,192,"  and all the songs of sopranos and tenors,"
8441,192,"  and those rapt oriental dances, of religious fervor,"
8442,192,"  and the sweet varied instruments, and the diapason of organs,"
8443,192,"  and all the artless plaints of love, and grief and death,"
8444,192,"  i said to my silent, curious soul, out of the bed of the slumber-"
8445,192,"        chamber,"
8446,192,"  come, for i have found the clue i sought so long,                "
8447,192,
8448,192,"  let us go forth refresh'd amid the day,"
8449,192,"  cheerfully tallying life, walking the world, the real,"
8450,192,"  nourish'd henceforth by our celestial dream,"
8451,192,
8452,192,"  and i said, moreover,"
8453,192,"  haply, what thou hast heard, o soul, was not the sound of winds,"
8454,192,"  nor dream of raging storm, nor sea-hawk's flapping wings, nor harsh"
8455,192,"        scream,"
8456,192,"  nor vocalism of sun-bright italy,"
8457,192,  nor german organ majestic--nor vast concourse of voices--nor layers
8458,192,        of harmonies;
8459,192,"  nor strophes of husbands and wives--nor sound of marching soldiers,"
8460,192,"  nor flutes, nor harps, nor the bugle-calls of camps;              "
8461,192,
8462,192,"  but, to a new rhythmus fitted for thee,"
8463,192,"  poems, bridging the way from life to death, vaguely wafted in night"
8464,192,"        air, uncaught, unwritten,"
8465,192,"  which, let us go forth in the bold day, and write,"
8466,193,"quicksand years that whirl me i know not whither,"
8467,193,"your schemes, politics, fail--lines give way--substances mock and"
8468,193,        elude me;
8469,193,"only the theme i sing, the great and strong-possess'd soul, eludes"
8470,193,        not;
8471,193,one's-self must never give way--that is the final substance--that out
8472,193,        of all is sure;
8473,193,"out of politics, triumphs, battles, life--what at last finally"
8474,193,        remains?
8475,193,"when shows break up, what but one's-self is sure?"
8476,194,race of veterans! race of victors!
8477,194,"race of the soil, ready for conflict! race of the conquering march!"
8478,194,"no more credulity's race, abiding-temper'd race"
8479,194,race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself;
8480,194,"race of passion and the storm,"
8481,195,"word over all, beautiful as the sky!"
8482,195,"beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be"
8483,195,        utterly lost;
8484,195,"that the hands of the sisters death and night, incessantly softly"
8485,195,"        wash again, and ever again, this soil'd world,"
8486,195,", for my enemy is dead--a man divine as myself is dead;"
8487,195,"i look where he lies, white-faced and still, in the coffin--i draw"
8488,195,        near;
8489,195,"i bend down, and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the"
8490,195,"        coffin,"

8492,196,"come, i will take you down underneath this impassive exterior--i will"
8493,196,        tell you what to say of me;

8496,196,"the friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, his lover, was"
8497,196,"        fondest,"
8498,196,"who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love"
8499,196,"        within him--and freely pour'd it forth,"
8500,196,"who often walk'd lonesome walks, thinking of his dear friends, his"
8501,196,"        lovers,"
8502,196,"who pensive, away from one he lov'd, often lay sleepless and"
8503,196,"        dissatisfied at night,"
8504,196,"who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov'd might"
8505,196,"        secretly be indifferent to him,"
8506,196,"whose happiest days were far away, through fields, in woods, on"
8507,196,"        hills, he and another, wandering hand in hand, they twain,"
8508,196,"        apart from other men,"
8509,196,"who oft as he saunter'd the streets, curv'd with his arm the shoulder"
8510,196,        of his friend--while the arm of his friend rested upon him

8516,197,  must we still go on with our affectations and sneaking?
8517,197,  let me bring this to a close--i pronounce openly for a new
8518,197,        distribution of roles;
8519,197,  let that which stood in front go behind! and let that which was

8529,197,        destination?

9155,201,i have run through what any river or strait of the globe has run
9156,201,        through;
9157,201,
9158,201,"i have taken my stand on the bases of peninsulas, and on the high"
9159,201,"        embedded rocks, to cry thence,"
9160,201,
9161,201,salut au monde!
9162,201,"what cities the light or warmth penetrates, i penetrate those cities"
9163,201,        myself;
9164,201,"all islands to which birds wing their way, i wing my way myself,"
9165,201,
9166,201,"toward all,"
9167,201,"i raise high the perpendicular hand--i make the signal,"
9168,201,"to remain after me in sight forever,"
9169,201,"for all the haunts and homes of men,"
9170,202,"thither, as i look, i see each result and glory retracing itself and"
9171,202,"        nestling close, always obligated;"
9172,202,"thither hours, months, years--thither trades, compacts,"
9173,202,"        establishments, even the most minute;"
9174,202,"thither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;"
9175,202,"thither we also, i with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,"
9176,202,"as a father, to his father going, takes his children along with him,"
9177,203,"i say whatever tastes sweet to the most perfect person, that is"
9178,203,"        finally right,"
9179,203,
9180,203,"i say nourish a great intellect, a great brain;"
9181,203,"if i have said anything to the contrary, i hereby retract it,"
9182,203,
9183,203,i say man shall not hold property in man;
9184,203,i say the least developed person on earth is just as important and
9185,203,"        sacred to himself or herself, as the most developed person is"
9186,203,"        to himself or herself,"
9187,203,
9188,203,"i say where liberty draws not the blood out of slavery, there slavery"
9189,203,"        draws the blood out of liberty,"
9190,203,"i say the word of the good old cause in these states, and resound it"
9191,203,"        hence over the world,"
9192,203,
9193,203,"i say the human shape or face is so great, it must never be made"
9194,203,        ridiculous;
9195,203,"i say for ornaments nothing outre can be allowed,"
9196,203,"and that anything is most beautiful without ornament,              "
9197,203,
9198,203,and that exaggerations will be sternly revenged in your own
9199,203,"        physiology, and in other persons' physiology also;"
9200,203,and i say that clean-shaped children can be jetted and conceived only
9201,203,"        where natural forms prevail in public, and the human face and"
9202,203,        form are never caricatured;
9203,203,"and i say that genius need never more be turned to romances,"
9204,203,"  for facts properly told, how mean appear all romances,"
9205,203,
9206,203,i say the word of lands fearing nothing--i will have no other land;
9207,203,i say discuss all and expose all--i am for every topic openly;
9208,203,i say there can be no salvation for these states without innovators--
9209,203,"        without free tongues, and ears willing to hear the tongues;"
9210,203,"and i announce as a glory of these states, that they respectfully"
9211,203,"        listen to propositions, reforms, fresh views and doctrines,"
9212,203,"        from successions of men and women,"
9213,203,"each age with its own growth,"
9214,203,
9215,203,"i have said many times that materials and the soul are great, and"
9216,203,        that all depends on physique;                                
9217,203,
9218,203,"now i reverse what i said, and affirm that all depends on the"
9219,203,"        æsthetic or intellectual,"
9220,203,and that criticism is great--and that refinement is greatest of all;
9221,203,and i affirm now that the mind governs--and that all depends on the
9222,203,"        mind,"
9223,203,
9224,203,with one man or woman--no matter which one--i even pick out the
9225,203,"        lowest,"
9226,203,with him or her i now illustrate the whole law;
9227,203,"i say that every right, in politics or what-not, shall be eligible to"
9228,203,"        that one man or woman, on the same terms as any,"
9229,204,"scented herbage of my breast,"
9230,204,"leaves from you i yield, i write, to be perused best afterwards,"
9231,204,"tomb-leaves, body-leaves, growing up above me, above death,"
9232,204,"perennial roots, tall leaves--o the winter shall not freeze you,"
9233,204,"               delicate leaves,"
9234,204,"every year shall you bloom again--out from where you retired, you"
9235,204,               shall emerge again;
9236,204,"o i do not know whether many, passing by, will discover you, or"
9237,204,               inhale your faint odor--but i believe a few will;
9238,204,"o slender leaves! o blossoms of my blood! i permit you to tell, in"
9239,204,"               your own way, of the heart that is under you;"
9240,204,o burning and throbbing--surely all will one day be accomplish'd;
9241,204,"o i do not know what you mean, there underneath yourselves--you are"
9242,204,"               not happiness,"
9243,204,"you are often more bitter than i can bear--you burn and sting me,"
9244,204,
9245,204,"yet you are very beautiful to me, you faint-tinged roots--you make me"
9246,204,"               think of death,"
9247,204,"death is beautiful from you--what indeed is finally beautiful,"
9248,204,               except death and love?
9249,204,--o i think it is not for life i am chanting here my chant of
9250,204,"               lovers--i think it must be for death,"
9251,204,"for how calm, how solemn it grows, to ascend to the atmosphere of"
9252,204,"               lovers,"
9253,204,"death or life i am then indifferent--my soul declines to prefer,"
9254,204,i am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most;
9255,204,"indeed, o death, i think now these leaves mean precisely the same as"
9256,204,               you mean;
9257,204,"grow up taller, sweet leaves, that i may see! grow up out of my"
9258,204,               breast!
9259,204,spring away from the conceal'd heart there!
9260,204,"do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots, timid leaves!"
9261,204,
9262,204,"do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!"
9263,204,"come, i am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of mine--i have"
9264,204,"               long enough stifled and choked,"
9265,204,"--emblematic and capricious blade, i leave you--now you serve me not;"
9266,204,"away! i will say what i have to say, by itself,"
9267,204,"i will escape from the sham that was proposed to me,"
9268,204,i will sound myself and comrades only--i will never again utter a
9269,204,"               call, only their call,"
9270,204,"i will raise, with it, immortal reverberations through the states,"
9271,204,"i will give an example to lovers, to take permanent shape and will"
9272,204,               through the states;
9273,204,through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating;
9274,204,"give me your tone therefore, o death, that i may accord with it,"
9275,204,
9276,204,"give me yourself--for i see that you belong to me now above all, and"
9277,204,are folded inseparably together--you love and death
9278,204,              are;
9279,204,nor will i allow you to balk me any more with what i was calling
9280,204,"              life,"
9281,204,"for now it is convey'd to me that you are the purports essential,"
9282,204,"that you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons--and that"
9283,204,"              they are mainly for you,"
9284,204,"that you, beyond them, come forth, to remain, the real reality,"
9285,204,"that behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter how"
9286,204,"              long,"
9287,204,"that you will one day, perhaps, take control of all,"
9288,204,"that you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,"
9289,204,that may-be you are what it is all for--but it does not last so very
9290,204,              long;
9291,204,"but you will last very long,"
9292,205,", out of the cradle endlessly rocking,"
9293,205,"  out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,"
9294,205,"  out of the ninth-month midnight,"
9295,205,"  over the sterile sands, and the fields beyond, where the child,"
9296,205,"        leaving his bed, wander'd alone, bare-headed, barefoot,"
9297,205,"  down from the shower'd halo,"
9298,205,"  up from the mystic play of shadows, twining and twisting as if they"
9299,205,"        were alive,"
9300,205,"  out from the patches of briers and blackberries,"
9301,205,"  from the memories of the bird that chanted to me,"
9302,205,"  from your memories, sad brother--from the fitful risings and fallings"
9303,205,"        i heard,"
9304,205,"  from under that yellow half-moon, late-risen, and swollen as if with"
9305,205,"        tears,                                                      "
9306,205,
9307,205,"  from those beginning notes of sickness and love, there in the"
9308,205,"        transparent mist,"
9309,205,"  from the thousand responses of my heart, never to cease,"
9310,205,"  from the myriad thence-arous'd words,"
9311,205,"  from the word stronger and more delicious than any,"
9312,205,"  from such, as now they start, the scene revisiting,"
9313,205,"  as a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,"
9314,205,"  borne hither--ere all eludes me, hurriedly,"
9315,205,"  a man--yet by these tears a little boy again,"
9316,205,"  throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,"
9317,205,"  i, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,        "
9318,205,
9319,205,"  taking all hints to use them--but swiftly leaping beyond them,"
9320,205,"  a reminiscence sing,"
9321,205,
9322,205,"  once, paumanok,"
9323,205,"  when the snows had melted--when the lilac-scent was in the air, and"
9324,205,"        the fifth-month grass was growing,"
9325,205,"  up this sea-shore, in some briers,"
9326,205,"  two guests from alabama--two together,"
9327,205,"  and their nest, and four light-green eggs, spotted with brown,"
9328,205,"  and every day the he-bird, to and fro, near at hand,"
9329,205,"  and every day the she-bird, crouch'd on her nest, silent, with bright"
9330,205,"        eyes,"
9331,205,"  and every day i, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing"
9332,205,"        them,                                                        "
9333,205,
9334,205,"  cautiously peering, absorbing, translating,"
9335,205,
9336,205,  shine! shine! shine!
9337,205,"  pour down your warmth, great sun!"
9338,205,"  while we bask--we two together,"
9339,205,
9340,205,  two together!
9341,205,"  winds blow south, or winds blow north,"
9342,205,"  day come white, or night come black,"
9343,205,"  home, or rivers and mountains from home,"
9344,205,"  singing all time, minding no time,"
9345,205,"  while we two keep together,                                        "
9346,205,
9347,205,"  till of a sudden,"
9348,205,"  may-be kill'd, unknown to her mate,"
9349,205,"  one forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the nest,"
9350,205,"  nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,"
9351,205,"  nor ever appear'd again,"
9352,205,
9353,205,"  and thenceforward, all summer, in the sound of the sea,"
9354,205,"  and at night, under the full of the moon, in calmer weather,"
9355,205,"  over the hoarse surging of the sea,"
9356,205,"  or flitting from brier to brier by day,"
9357,205,"  i saw, i heard at intervals, the remaining one, the he-bird,      "
9358,205,
9359,205,"  the solitary guest from alabama,"
9360,205,
9361,205,  blow! blow! blow!
9362,205,"  blow up, sea-winds, along paumanok's shore!"
9363,205,"  i wait and i wait, till you blow my mate to me,"
9364,205,
9365,205,"  yes, when the stars glisten'd,"
9366,205,"  all night long, on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake,"
9367,205,"  down, almost amid the slapping waves,"
9368,205,"  sat the lone singer, wonderful, causing tears,"
9369,205,
9370,205,  he call'd on his mate;
9371,205,"  he pour'd forth the meanings which i, of all men, know,            "
9372,205,
9373,205,"  yes, my brother, i know;"
9374,205,  the rest might not--but i have treasur'd every note;
9375,205,"  for once, and more than once, dimly, down to the beach gliding,"
9376,205,"  silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,"
9377,205,"  recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights"
9378,205,"        after their sorts,"
9379,205,"  the white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,"
9380,205,"  i, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,"
9381,205,"  listen'd long and long,"
9382,205,
9383,205,"  listen'd, to keep, to sing--now translating the notes,"
9384,205,"  following you, my brother,                                        "
9385,205,
9386,205,  soothe! soothe! soothe!
9387,205,"  close on its wave soothes the wave behind,"
9388,205,"  and again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close,"
9389,205,"  but my love soothes not me, not me,"
9390,205,
9391,205,  low hangs the moon--it rose late;
9392,205,"  o it is lagging--o i think it is heavy with love, with love,"
9393,205,
9394,205,"  o madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land,"
9395,205,"  with love--with love,"
9396,205,
9397,205,  o night! do i not see my love fluttering out there among the
9398,205,        breakers?
9399,205,  what is that little black thing i see there in the white?          
9400,205,
9401,205,  loud! loud! loud!
9402,205,"  loud i call to you, my love!"
9403,205,
9404,205,  high and clear i shoot my voice over the waves;
9405,205,"  surely you must know who is here, is here;"
9406,205,"  you must know who i am, my love,"
9407,205,
9408,205,  low-hanging moon!
9409,205,  what is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?
9410,205,"  o it is the shape, the shape of my mate!"
9411,205,"  o moon, do not keep her from me any longer,"
9412,205,
9413,205,  land! land! o land!                                                
9414,205,
9415,205,"  whichever way i turn, o i think you could give me my mate back again,"
9416,205,        if you only would;
9417,205,"  for i am almost sure i see her dimly whichever way i look,"
9418,205,
9419,205,  o rising stars!
9420,205,"  perhaps the one i want so much will rise, will rise with some of you,"
9421,205,
9422,205,  o throat! o trembling throat!
9423,205,  sound clearer through the atmosphere!
9424,205,"  pierce the woods, the earth;"
9425,205,"  somewhere listening to catch you, must be the one i want,"
9426,205,
9427,205,"  shake out, carols!"
9428,205,  solitary here--the night's carols!                                
9429,205,
9430,205,  carols of lonesome love! death's carols!
9431,205,"  carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!"
9432,205,"  o, under that moon, where she droops almost down into the sea!"
9433,205,"  o reckless, despairing carols,"
9434,205,
9435,205,  but soft! sink low;
9436,205,  soft! let me just murmur;
9437,205,"  and do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea;"
9438,205,"  for somewhere i believe i heard my mate responding to me,"
9439,205,"  so faint--i must be still, be still to listen;"
9440,205,"  but not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to"
9441,205,"        me,                                                        "
9442,205,
9443,205,"  hither, my love!"
9444,205,  here i am! here!
9445,205,  with this just-sustain'd note i announce myself to you;
9446,205,"  this gentle call is for you, my love, for you,"
9447,205,
9448,205,  do not be decoy'd elsewhere!
9449,205,  that is the whistle of the wind--it is not my voice;
9450,205,"  that is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray;"
9451,205,"  those are the shadows of leaves,"
9452,205,
9453,205,  o darkness! o in vain!
9454,205,"  o i am very sick and sorrowful,                                  "
9455,205,
9456,205,"  o brown halo in the sky, near the moon, drooping upon the sea!"
9457,205,  o troubled reflection in the sea!
9458,205,  o throat! o throbbing heart!
9459,205,"  o all--and i singing uselessly, uselessly all the night,"
9460,205,
9461,205,"  yet i murmur, murmur on!"
9462,205,"  o murmurs--you yourselves make me continue to sing, i know not why,"
9463,205,
9464,205,  o past! o life! o songs of joy!
9465,205,  in the air--in the woods--over fields;
9466,205,  loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!
9467,205,"  but my love no more, no more with me!                            "
9468,205,
9469,205,"  we two together no more,"
9470,205,
9471,205,  the aria sinking;
9472,205,"  all else continuing--the stars shining,"
9473,205,"  the winds blowing--the notes of the bird continuous echoing,"
9474,205,"  with angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,"
9475,205,"  on the sands of paumanok's shore, gray and rustling;"
9476,205,"  the yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of"
9477,205,        the sea almost touching;
9478,205,"  the boy extatic--with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the"
9479,205,"        atmosphere dallying,"
9480,205,"  the love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously"
9481,205,"        bursting,"
9482,205,"  the aria's meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,      "
9483,205,
9484,205,"  the strange tears down the cheeks coursing,"
9485,205,"  the colloquy there--the trio--each uttering,"
9486,205,"  the undertone--the savage old mother, incessantly crying,"
9487,205,  to the boy's soul's questions sullenly timing--some drown'd secret
9488,205,"        hissing,"
9489,205,"  to the outsetting bard of love,"
9490,205,
9491,205,"  demon or bird! said the boy's soul,"
9492,205,  is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it mostly to me?
9493,205,"  for i, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping,"
9494,205,"  now i have heard you,"
9495,205,"  now in a moment i know what i am for--i awake,                    "
9496,205,
9497,205,"  and already a thousand singers--a thousand songs, clearer, louder and"
9498,205,"        more sorrowful than yours,"
9499,205,"  a thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me,"
9500,205,"  never to die,"
9501,205,
9502,205,"  o you singer, solitary, singing by yourself--projecting me;"
9503,205,"  o solitary me, listening--nevermore shall i cease perpetuating you;"
9504,205,"  never more shall i escape, never more the reverberations,"
9505,205,"  never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,"
9506,205,  never again leave me to be the peaceful child i was before what
9507,205,"        there, in the night,"
9508,205,"  by the sea, under the yellow and sagging moon,"
9509,205,"  the messenger there arous'd--the fire, the sweet hell within,    "
9510,205,
9511,205,"  the unknown want, the destiny of me,"
9512,205,
9513,205,  o give me the clew! it lurks in the night here somewhere
9514,205,"  o if i am to have so much, let me have more!"
9515,205,  o a word! o what is my destination? i fear it is henceforth chaos
9516,205,"  o how joys, dreads, convolutions, human shapes, and all shapes,"
9517,205,        spring as from graves around me!
9518,205,  o phantoms! you cover all the land and all the sea!
9519,205,  o i cannot see in the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me;
9520,205,"  o vapor, a look, a word! o well-beloved!"
9521,205,  o you dear women's and men's phantoms!
9522,205,
9523,205,"  a word then, for i will conquer it,                            "
9524,205,
9525,205,"  the word final, superior to all,"
9526,205,"  subtle, sent up--what is it?--i listen;"
9527,205,"  are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?"
9528,205,  is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?
9529,205,
9530,205,"  whereto answering, the sea,"
9531,205,"  delaying not, hurrying not,"
9532,205,"  whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before day-break,"
9533,205,  lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death;
9534,205,"  and again death--ever death, death, death,"
9535,205,"  hissing melodious, neither like the bird, nor like my arous'd child's"
9536,205,"        heart,                                                      "
9537,205,
9538,205,"  but edging near, as privately for me, rustling at my feet,"
9539,205,"  creeping thence steadily up to my ears, and laving me softly all"
9540,205,"        over,"
9541,205,"  death, death, death, death, death,"
9542,205,
9543,205,"  which i do not forget,"
9544,205,"  but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,"
9545,205,"  that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanok's gray beach,"
9546,205,"  with the thousand responsive songs, at random,"
9547,205,"  my own songs, awaked from that hour;"
9548,205,"  and with them the key, the word up from the waves,"
9549,205,"  the word of the sweetest song, and all songs,"
9550,205,
9551,205,"  that strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,"
9552,205,"  the sea whisper'd me,"
9553,206,"shut not your doors to me, proud libraries,"
9554,206,"for that which was lacking on all your well-fill'd shelves, yet"
9555,206,"        needed most, i bring;"
9556,206,"forth from the army, the war emerging--a book i have made,"
9557,206,the words of my book nothing--the drift of it everything;
9558,206,"a book separate, not link'd with the rest, nor felt by the intellect,"
9559,206,"but you, ye untold latencies, will thrill to every page;"
9560,206,"through space and time fused in a chant, and the flowing, eternal"
9561,206,"        identity,"
9562,206,"to nature, encompassing these, encompassing god--to the joyous,"
9563,206,"        electric all,"
9564,206,"to the sense of death--and accepting, exulting in death, in its turn,"
9565,206,"        the same as life,"
9566,206,"the entrance of man i sing,"
9567,207,"poet,"
9568,207,
9569,207,"  o a new song, a free song,"
9570,207,"  flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,"
9571,207,"  by the wind's voice and that of the drum,"
9572,207,"  by the banner's voice, and child's voice, and sea's voice, and"
9573,207,"        father's voice,"
9574,207,"  low on the ground and high in the air,"
9575,207,"  on the ground where father and child stand,"
9576,207,"  in the upward air where their eyes turn,"
9577,207,"  where the banner at day-break is flapping,"
9578,207,
9579,207,  words! book-words! what are you?
9580,207,"  words no more, for hearken and see,                                "
9581,207,
9582,207,"  my song is there in the open air--and i must sing,"
9583,207,"  with the banner and pennant a-flapping,"
9584,207,
9585,207,"  i'll weave the chord and twine in,"
9586,207,"  man's desire and babe's desire--i'll twine them in, i'll put in life;"
9587,207,  i'll put the bayonet's flashing point--i'll let bullets and slugs
9588,207,        whizz;
9589,207,"  as one carrying a symbol and menace, far into the future,"
9590,207,"  crying with trumpet voice, arouse and beware! beware and arouse!"
9591,207,"  i'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of"
9592,207,        joy;
9593,207,"  then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,"
9594,207,"  with the banner and pennant a-flapping,                            "
9595,207,
9596,207,"pennant,"
9597,207,
9598,207,"  come up here, bard, bard;"
9599,207,"  come up here, soul, soul;"
9600,207,"  come up here, dear little child,"
9601,207,"  to fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measureless"
9602,207,"        light,"
9603,207,
9604,207,"child,"
9605,207,
9606,207,"  father, what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?"
9607,207,  and what does it say to me all the while?
9608,207,
9609,207,"father,"
9610,207,
9611,207,"  nothing, my babe, you see in the sky;"
9612,207,"  and nothing at all to you it says, but look you, my babe,"
9613,207,"  look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the money-"
9614,207,        shops opening;
9615,207,  and see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with
9616,207,"        goods,                                                      "
9617,207,
9618,207,"  these! ah, these! how valued and toil'd for, these!"
9619,207,  how envied by all the earth!
9620,207,
9621,207,"poet,"
9622,207,
9623,207,"  fresh and rosy red, the sun is mounting high;"
9624,207,"  on floats the sea in distant blue, careering through its channels;"
9625,207,"  on floats the wind over the breast of the sea, setting in toward"
9626,207,        land;
9627,207,"  the great steady wind from west and west-by-south,"
9628,207,"  floating so buoyant, with milk-white foam on the waters,"
9629,207,
9630,207,"  but i am not the sea, nor the red sun;"
9631,207,"  i am not the wind, with girlish laughter;"
9632,207,  not the immense wind which strengthens--not the wind which lashes;
9633,207,
9634,207,  not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death;
9635,207,"  but i am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,"
9636,207,"  which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,"
9637,207,"  which the birds know in the woods, mornings and evenings,"
9638,207,"  and the shore-sands know, and the hissing wave, and that banner and"
9639,207,"        pennant,"
9640,207,"  aloft there flapping and flapping,"
9641,207,
9642,207,"child,"
9643,207,
9644,207,"  o father, it is alive--it is full of people--it has children!"
9645,207,  o now it seems to me it is talking to its children!
9646,207,  i hear it--it talks to me--o it is wonderful!
9647,207,"  o it stretches--it spreads and runs so fast! o my father,          "
9648,207,
9649,207,"  it is so broad, it covers the whole sky!"
9650,207,
9651,207,"father,"
9652,207,
9653,207,"  cease, cease, my foolish babe,"
9654,207,  what you are saying is sorrowful to me--much it displeases me;
9655,207,"  behold with the rest, again i say--behold not banners and pennants"
9656,207,        aloft;
9657,207,  but the well-prepared pavements behold--and mark the solid-wall'd
9658,207,"        houses,"
9659,207,
9660,207,"banner and pennant,"
9661,207,
9662,207,"  speak to the child, o bard, out of manhattan;"
9663,207,"  the war is over--yet never over,, out of it, we are born to real"
9664,207,        life and identity
9665,207,"  speak to our children all, or north or south of manhattan,"
9666,207,"  where our factory-engines hum, where our miners delve the ground,"
9667,207,"  where our hoarse niagara rumbles, where our prairie-plows are"
9668,207,        plowing;                                                    
9669,207,
9670,207,"  speak, o bard! point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all--"
9671,207,        and yet we know not why;
9672,207,"  for what are we, mere strips of cloth, profiting nothing,"
9673,207,  only flapping in the wind?
9674,207,
9675,207,"poet,"
9676,207,
9677,207,  i hear and see not strips of cloth alone;
9678,207,"  i hear again the tramp of armies, i hear the challenging sentry;"
9679,207,  i hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men--i hear liberty!
9680,207,"  i hear the drums beat, and the trumpets yet blowing;"
9681,207,"  i myself move abroad, swift-rising, flying then;"
9682,207,"  i use the wings of the land-bird, and use the wings of the sea-bird,"
9683,207,        and look down as from a height;
9684,207,"  i do not deny the precious results of peace--i see populous cities,"
9685,207,        with wealth incalculable;                                    
9686,207,
9687,207,  i see numberless farms--i see the farmers working in their fields or
9688,207,        barns;
9689,207,"  i see mechanics working--i see buildings everywhere founded, going"
9690,207,"        up, or finish'd;"
9691,207,"  i see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks, drawn by"
9692,207,        the locomotives;
9693,207,"  i see the stores, depots, of boston, baltimore, charleston, new"
9694,207,        orleans;
9695,207,"  i see far in the west the immense area of grain--i dwell awhile,"
9696,207,        hovering;
9697,207,"  i pass to the lumber forests of the north, and again to the southern"
9698,207,"        plantation, and again to california;"
9699,207,"  sweeping the whole, i see the countless profit, the busy gatherings,"
9700,207,        earned wages;
9701,207,  see the identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and haughty
9702,207,        states and many more to come
9703,207,  see forts on the shores of harbors--see ships sailing in and out;
9704,207,"  then over all, aye! aye! my little and lengthen'd pennant, shaped"
9705,207,"        like a sword,                                                "
9706,207,
9707,207,"  runs swiftly up, indicating war and defiance--and now the halyards"
9708,207,"        have rais'd it,"
9709,207,"  side of my banner broad and blue--side of my starry banner,"
9710,207,"  discarding peace over all the sea and land,"
9711,207,
9712,207,"                         banner and pennant,"
9713,207,
9714,207,"  yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!"
9715,207,  no longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone;
9716,207,"  we may be terror and carnage, and are so now;"
9717,207,"  not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty states, nor any"
9718,207,"        five, nor ten"
9719,207,"  nor market nor depot are we, nor money-bank in the city;"
9720,207,"  but these, and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines"
9721,207,"        below, are ours;"
9722,207,"  and the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers, great and"
9723,207,        small;                                                      
9724,207,
9725,207,"  and the fields they moisten are ours, and the crops and the fruits"
9726,207,        are ours;
9727,207,"  bays and channels, and ships sailing in and out, are ours--and we"
9728,207,"        over all,"
9729,207,"  over the area spread below, the three or four millions of square"
9730,207,"        miles--the capitals,"
9731,207,"  the forty millions of people--o bard! in life and death supreme,"
9732,207,"  we, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,"
9733,207,"  not for the present alone, for a thousand years, chanting through"
9734,207,"        you,"
9735,207,"  this song to the soul of one poor little child,"
9736,207,
9737,207,"child,"
9738,207,
9739,207,"  o my father, i like not the houses;"
9740,207,  they will never to me be anything--nor do i like money;
9741,207,"  but to mount up there i would like, o father dear--that banner i"
9742,207,        like;                                                        
9743,207,
9744,207,"  that pennant i would be, and must be,"
9745,207,
9746,207,"father,"
9747,207,
9748,207,"  child of mine, you fill me with anguish;"
9749,207,  to be that pennant would be too fearful;
9750,207,"  little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever;"
9751,207,"  it is to gain nothing, but risk and defy everything;"
9752,207,"  forward to stand in front of wars--and o, such wars!--what have you"
9753,207,        to do with them?
9754,207,"  with passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?"
9755,207,
9756,207,"poet,"
9757,207,
9758,207,  demons and death then i sing;
9759,207,"  put in all, aye all, will i--sword-shaped pennant for war, and banner"
9760,207,"        so broad and blue,"
9761,207,"  and a pleasure new and extatic, and the prattled yearning of"
9762,207,"        children,                                                    "
9763,207,
9764,207,"  blent with the sounds of the peaceful land, and the liquid wash of"
9765,207,        the sea;
9766,207,"  and the black ships, fighting on the sea, enveloped in smoke;"
9767,207,"  and the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and"
9768,207,        pines;
9769,207,"  and the whirr of drums, and the sound of soldiers marching, and the"
9770,207,        hot sun shining south;
9771,207,"  and the beech-waves combing over the beach on my eastern shore, and"
9772,207,        my western shore the same;
9773,207,"  and all between those shores, and my ever running mississippi, with"
9774,207,        bends and chutes;
9775,207,"  and my illinois fields, and my kansas fields, and my fields of"
9776,207,        missouri;
9777,207,"  the continent--devoting the whole identity, without reserving an"
9778,207,"        atom,"
9779,207,"  pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all, and the yield"
9780,207,"        of all,"
9781,207,
9782,207,"                         banner and pennant,"
9783,207,
9784,207,"  aye all! for ever, for all!                                      "
9785,207,
9786,207,"  from sea to sea, north and south, east and west,"
9787,207,"  the war is completed, the price is paid, the title is settled beyond"
9788,207,        recall
9789,207,"  fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole;"
9790,207,"  no more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,"
9791,207,"  but, out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no"
9792,207,"        more,"
9793,207,"  croaking like crows here in the wind,"
9794,207,
9795,207,"                               poet,"
9796,207,"                             finale,"
9797,207,
9798,207,"  my limbs, my veins dilate;"
9799,207,"  the blood of the world has fill'd me full--my theme is clear at last,"

9819,207,"  not the superb ships, with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and"
9820,207,"        carrying cargoes,"
9821,207,"  nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues,--but you, as henceforth"
9822,207,"        i see you,                                                  "

10126,214," i breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,"
10127,214," the distillation would intoxicate me also, but i shall not let it,"
10128,214,
10129,214," the atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,"
10130,214," it is for my mouth forever, i am in love with it,"
10131,214," i will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,"
10132,214," i am mad for it to be in contact with me,"
10133,214,
10134,214," the smoke of my own breath,"
10135,214," echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,"
10136,214," my respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs,"
10137,214," the sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,"
10138,214," the sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies of the wind,"
10139,214," a few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,"
10140,214," the play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,"
10141,214," the delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,"
10142,214," the feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun,"

10186,214," as the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,"
10187,214," leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the house with their plenty,"
10188,214," shall i postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,"
10189,214," that they turn from gazing after and down the road,"
10190,214," and forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,"
10191,214," exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?  "

10217,214," only the lull i like, the hum of your valvèd voice,"
10218,214,
10219,214," i mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,"
10220,214," how you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,"
10221,214," and parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,"
10222,214," and reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet,"
10223,214,
10224,214," swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,"
10225,214," and i know that the hand of god is the promise of my own,"
10226,214," and i know that the spirit of god is the brother of my own,"

10234,214," how could i answer the child? i do not know what it is any more than he,"
10235,214,
10236,214," i guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven,"
10237,214,
10238,214," or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord,"
10239,214," a scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,"
10240,214," bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say whose?"
10241,214,
10242,214," or i guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation,"
10243,214,
10244,214," or i guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,"
10245,214," and it means, sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,"
10246,214," growing among black folks as among white,"
10247,214," kanuck, tuckahoe, congressman, cuff, i give them the same, i receive them the same,"
10248,214,
10249,214," and now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves,"
10250,214,
10251,214," tenderly will i use you curling grass,"
10252,214," it may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,"
10253,214," it may be if i had known them i would have loved them,"
10254,214," it may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps,"
10255,214," and here you are the mothers' laps,"
10256,214,
10257,214," this grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,"
10258,214," darker than the colorless beards of old men,"
10259,214," dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths,"
10260,214,
10261,214," o i perceive after all so many uttering tongues,"
10262,214," and i perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing,"
10263,214,
10264,214," i wish i could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,"
10265,214," and the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps,"
10266,214,
10267,214, what do you think has become of the young and old men?
10268,214, and what do you think has become of the women and children?
10269,214,
10270,214," they are alive and well somewhere,"
10271,214," the smallest sprout shows there is really no death,"
10272,214," and if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,"
10273,214," and ceas'd the moment life appear'd,"
10274,214,
10275,214," all goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,"
10276,214," and to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier,"
10277,214,
10278,214, has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
10279,214," i hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and i know it,"
10280,214,
10281,214," i pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd babe, and am not contain'd between my hat and boots,"
10282,214," and peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,"
10283,214," the earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good,"
10284,214,
10285,214," i am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,"
10286,214," i am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself,"
10287,214," they do not know how immortal, but i know,"

10289,214," every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,"
10290,214," for me those that have been boys and that love women,"
10291,214," for me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,"
10292,214," for me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of mothers,"
10293,214," for me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,"
10294,214," for me children and the begetters of children,"
10295,214,
10296,214," undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,"
10297,214," i see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,"
10298,214," and am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away,"

10300,214," the little one sleeps in its cradle,"
10301,214," i lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand,"

10303,214," the youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,"
10304,214," i peeringly view them from the top,"
10305,214,
10306,214," the suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,"
10307,214," i witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, i note where the pistol has fallen,"

10309,214," the blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders,"
10310,214," the heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,"
10311,214," the snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,"
10312,214," the hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,"
10313,214," the flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,"
10314,214," the meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,"
10315,214," the excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd,"
10316,214," the impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,"
10317,214," what groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or in fits,"
10318,214," what exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes,"
10319,214," what living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain'd by decorum,"
10320,214," arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips,"
10321,214," i mind them or the show or resonance of them -- i come and i depart,"
10322,214,
10323,214," the big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,"
10324,214," the dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,"
10325,214," the clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,"
10326,214," the armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow,"
10327,214,
10328,214," i am there, i help, i came stretch'd atop of the load,"
10329,214," i felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,"
10330,214," i jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,"
10331,214," and roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps,"
10332,214,
10333,214," alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt,"
10334,214," wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,"
10335,214," in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,"
10336,214," kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,"
10337,214," falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my side,"

10348,214," her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,"
10349,214," on a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,"
10350,214," she had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her feet,"
10351,214,
10352,214," the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,"
10353,214," i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,"
10354,214," through the swung half-door of the kitchen i saw him limpsy and weak,"
10355,214," and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,"
10356,214," and brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and bruis'd feet,"
10357,214," and gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,"
10358,214," and remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,"
10359,214, and remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;
10360,214," he staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd north,"

10385,214," the young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,"
10386,214," they do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,"
10387,214," they do not think whom they souse with spray,"

10396,214," the lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,"
10397,214," overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,"
10398,214," they do not hasten, each man hits in his place,"
10399,214,
10400,214," the negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain,"
10401,214," the negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string-piece,"
10402,214," his blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band,"
10403,214," his glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead,"

10410,214," to niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,"
10411,214," absorbing all to myself and for this song,"
10412,214,
10413,214," oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes?"
10414,214," it seems to me more than all the print i have read in my life,"
10415,214,
10416,214," my tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long ramble,"
10417,214," they rise together, they slowly circle around,"
10418,214,
10419,214," i believe in those wing'd purposes,"
10420,214," and acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,"
10421,214," and consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,"
10422,214," and do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,"
10423,214," and the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,"
10424,214," and the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me,"

10426,214," the wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,"
10427,214," ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,"
10428,214," the pert may suppose it meaningless, but i listening close,"

10757,214," voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,"
10758,214," voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,"
10759,214," and of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,"
10760,214," and of the rights of them the others are down upon,"
10761,214," of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,"
10762,214," fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung,"
10763,214,
10764,214," through me forbidden voices,"
10765,214," voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and i remove the veil,"
10766,214," voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd,"
10767,214,
10768,214," i do not press my fingers across my mouth,"
10769,214," i keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,"
10770,214," copulation is no more rank to me than death is,"
10771,214,
10772,214," i believe in the flesh and the appetites,"
10773,214," seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle,"
10774,214,
10775,214," divine am i inside and out, and i make holy whatever i touch or am touch'd from,"
10776,214," the scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,"
10777,214," this head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds,"
10778,214,
10779,214," if i worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,"
10780,214, translucent mould of me it shall be you!
10781,214, shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!
10782,214, firm masculine colter it shall be you!
10783,214, whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!
10784,214, you my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!
10785,214, breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!
10786,214, my brain it shall be your occult convolutions!
10787,214, root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!
10788,214," mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!"
10789,214," trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!"
10790,214, sun so generous it shall be you!
10791,214, vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!
10792,214, you sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!
10793,214, winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!
10794,214," broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!"
10795,214," hands i have taken, face i have kiss'd, mortal i have ever touch'd, it shall be you,"
10796,214,
10797,214," i dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,"
10798,214," each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,"
10799,214," i cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,"
10800,214," nor the cause of the friendship i emit, nor the cause of the friendship i take again,"
10801,214,
10802,214," that i walk up my stoop, i pause to consider if it really be,"
10803,214," a morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books,"
10804,214,
10805,214, to behold the day-break!
10806,214," the little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,"
10807,214," the air tastes good to my palate,"
10808,214,
10809,214," hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding,"
10810,214," scooting obliquely high and low,"
10811,214,
10812,214," something i cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,"
10813,214," seas of bright juice suffuse heaven,"
10814,214,
10815,214," the earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,"
10816,214," the heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,"
10817,214," the mocking taunt, see then whether you shall be master!"
10818,214,
10819,214," dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,"
10820,214," if i could not now and always send sun-rise out of me,"
10821,214,
10822,214," we also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,"
10823,214," we found our own o my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak,"
10824,214,
10825,214," my voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,"
10826,214," with the twirl of my tongue i encompass worlds and volumes of worlds,"
10827,214,
10828,214," speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,"
10829,214," it provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,"
10830,214," walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?"
10831,214,
10832,214," come now i will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation,"
10833,214, do you not know o speech how the buds beneath you are folded?
10834,214," waiting in gloom, protected by frost,"
10835,214," the dirt receding before my prophetical screams,"
10836,214," i underlying causes to balance them at last,"
10837,214," my knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,"
10838,214," happiness, which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day,"
10839,214,
10840,214," my final merit i refuse you, i refuse putting from me what i really am,"
10841,214," encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,"
10842,214," i crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you,"
10843,214,
10844,214," writing and talk do not prove me,"
10845,214," i carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,"
10846,214," with the hush of my lips i wholly confound the skeptic,"
10847,214,
10848,214," now i will do nothing but listen,"
10849,214," to accrue what i hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it,"
10850,214,
10851,214," i hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals,"
10852,214," i hear the sound i love, the sound of the human voice,"
10853,214," i hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,"
10854,214," sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,"
10855,214," talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals,"
10856,214," the angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,"
10857,214," the judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence,"
10858,214," the heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters,"
10859,214," the ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color'd lights,"
10860,214," the steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,"
10861,214," the slow march play'd at the head of the association marching two and two,"
10862,214," they go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin,"
10863,214,
10864,214," i hear the violoncello, 'tis the young man's heart's complaint,"
10865,214," i hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,"
10866,214," it shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast,"
10867,214,
10868,214," i hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,"
10869,214," ah this indeed is music -- this suits me,"
10870,214,
10871,214," a tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,"
10872,214," the orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full,"
10873,214,
10874,214, i hear the train'd soprano what work with hers is this?
10875,214," the orchestra whirls me wider than uranus flies,"
10876,214," it wrenches such ardors from me i did not know i possess'd them,"
10877,214," it sails me, i dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent waves,"
10878,214," i am cut by bitter and angry hail, i lose my breath,"
10879,214," steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,"
10880,214,
10881,214," at length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,"
10882,214," and that we call being,"
10883,214,
10884,214," to be in any form, what is that?"
10885,214," round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,"
10886,214," if nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough,"
10887,214,
10888,214," mine is no callous shell,"
10889,214," i have instant conductors all over me whether i pass or stop,"
10890,214," they seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me,"
10891,214,
10892,214," i merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,"
10893,214," to touch my person to some one else's is about as much as i can stand,"
10894,214,
10895,214," is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,"
10896,214," flames and ether making a rush for my veins,"
10897,214," treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,"
10898,214," my flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself,"
10899,214," on all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,"
10900,214," straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,"
10901,214," behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,"
10902,214," depriving me of my best as for a purpose,"
10903,214," unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,"
10904,214," deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,"
10905,214," immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,"
10906,214," they bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,"
10907,214," no consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,"
10908,214," fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,"
10909,214," then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me,"
10910,214,
10911,214," the sentries desert every other part of me,"
10912,214," they have left me helpless to a red marauder,"
10913,214," they all come to the headland to witness and assist against me,"
10914,214,
10915,214," i am given up by traitors,"
10916,214," i talk wildly, i have lost my wits, i and nobody else am the greatest traitor,"
10917,214," i went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there,"
10918,214,
10919,214," you villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,"
10920,214," unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me,  "
10921,214,
10922,214," blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd touch!"
10923,214," did it make you ache so, leaving me?"
10924,214,
10925,214," parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,"
10926,214," rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward,"
10927,214,
10928,214," sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,"
10929,214," landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden,  "
10930,214,
10931,214," all truths wait in all things,"
10932,214," they neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,"
10933,214," they do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,"
10934,214," the insignificant is as big to me as any,"
10935,214, what is less or more than a touch?
10936,214,
10937,214," logic and sermons never convince,"
10938,214," the damp of the night drives deeper into my soul,"
10939,214,
10940,214," only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,"
10941,214," only what nobody denies is so,"
10942,214,
10943,214," a minute and a drop of me settle my brain,"
10944,214," i believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,"
10945,214," and a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,"
10946,214," and a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,"
10947,214," and they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,"
10948,214," and until one and all shall delight us, and we them,  "
10949,214,
10950,214," i believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,"
10951,214," and the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,"
10952,214," and the tree-toad is a chef-d'œuvre for the highest,"
10953,214," and the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,"
10954,214," and the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,"
10955,214," and the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue,"
10956,214," and a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels,"
10957,214,
10958,214," i find i incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,"
10959,214," and am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,"
10960,214," and have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,"
10961,214," but call any thing back again when i desire it,"
10962,214,
10963,214," in vain the speeding or shyness,"
10964,214," in vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,"
10965,214," in vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones,"
10966,214," in vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,"
10967,214," in vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,"
10968,214," in vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,"
10969,214," in vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,"
10970,214," in vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,"
10971,214," in vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to labrador,"
10972,214," i follow quickly, i ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff,  "
10973,214,
10974,214," i think i could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain'd,"
10975,214," i stand and look at them long and long,"
10976,214,
10977,214," they do not sweat and whine about their condition,"
10978,214," they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,"
10979,214," they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god,"
10980,214," not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,"
10981,214," not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,"
10982,214," not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth,"
10983,214,
10984,214," so they show their relations to me and i accept them,"
10985,214," they bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession,"
10986,214,
10987,214," i wonder where they get those tokens,"
10988,214, did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?
10989,214,
10990,214," myself moving forward then and now and forever,"
10991,214," gathering and showing more always and with velocity,"
10992,214," infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,"
10993,214," not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,"
10994,214," picking out here one that i love, and now go with him on brotherly terms,"
10995,214,
10996,214," a gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,"
10997,214," head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,"
10998,214," limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,"
10999,214," eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving,"
11000,214,
11001,214," his nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,"
11002,214," his well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return,"
11003,214,
11004,214," i but use you a minute, then i resign you, stallion,"
11005,214, why do i need your paces when i myself out-gallop them?
11006,214," even as i stand or sit passing faster than you,"
11007,214,
11008,214," space and time! now i see it is true, what i guess'd at,"
11009,214," what i guess'd when i loaf'd on the grass,"
11010,214," what i guess'd while i lay alone in my bed,"
11011,214," and again as i walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the morning,"
11012,214,
11013,214," my ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,"
11014,214," i skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,"
11015,214," i am afoot with my vision,"
11016,214,
11017,214," by the city's quadrangular houses -- in log huts, camping with lumbermen,"
11018,214," along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,"
11019,214," weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,"
11020,214," prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,"
11021,214," scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river,"
11022,214," where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter,"
11023,214," where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish,"
11024,214," where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,"
11025,214," where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;"
11026,214," over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field,"
11027,214," over the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum and slender shoots from the gutters,"
11028,214," over the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax,"
11029,214," over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest,"
11030,214, over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;
11031,214," scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs,"
11032,214," walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,"
11033,214," where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,"
11034,214," where the bat flies in the seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark,"
11035,214," where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,"
11036,214," where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,"
11037,214," where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;"
11038,214," where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,"
11039,214," wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,"
11040,214," where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, floating in it myself and looking composedly down,"
11041,214," where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,"
11042,214," where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,"
11043,214," where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,"
11044,214," where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,"
11045,214," where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,"
11046,214," where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;"
11047,214," where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the regiments,"
11048,214," approaching manhattan up by the long-stretching island,"
11049,214," under niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,"
11050,214," upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,"
11051,214," upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base-ball,"
11052,214," at he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter,"
11053,214," at the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw,"
11054,214," at apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit i find,"
11055,214," at musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;"
11056,214," where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps,"
11057,214," where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,"
11058,214," where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,"
11059,214," where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,"
11060,214," where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,"
11061,214," where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near,"
11062,214," where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding,"
11063,214," where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh,"
11064,214," where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds,"
11065,214," where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out,"
11066,214," where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,"
11067,214," where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,"
11068,214," where the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,"
11069,214," where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,"
11070,214," where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well,"
11071,214," through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,"
11072,214," through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,"
11073,214," through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon, through the office or public hall;"
11074,214," pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd with the new and old,"
11075,214," pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,"
11076,214," pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,"
11077,214," pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,"
11078,214," pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating methodist preacher, impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;"
11079,214," looking in at the shop-windows of broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,"
11080,214," wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,"
11081,214," my right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and i in the middle;"
11082,214," coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy, behind me he rides at the drape of the day,"
11083,214," far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet, or the moccasin print,"
11084,214," by the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,"
11085,214," nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;"
11086,214," voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,"
11087,214," hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,"
11088,214," hot toward one i hate, ready in my madness to knife him,"
11089,214," solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,"
11090,214," walking the old hills of judæa with the beautiful gentle god by my side,"
11091,214," speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,"
11092,214," speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles,"
11093,214," speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,"
11094,214," carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,"
11095,214," storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,"
11096,214," backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,"
11097,214," i tread day and night such roads,"
11098,214,
11099,214," i visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,"
11100,214," and look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green,"
11101,214,
11102,214," i fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,"
11103,214," my course runs below the soundings of plummets,"
11104,214,
11105,214," i help myself to material and immaterial,"
11106,214," no guard can shut me off, no law prevent me,"
11107,214,
11108,214," i anchor my ship for a little while only,"
11109,214," my messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me,"
11110,214,
11111,214," i go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue,"
11112,214,
11113,214," i ascend to the foretruck,"
11114,214," i take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,"
11115,214," we sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,"
11116,214," through the clear atmosphere i stretch around on the wonderful beauty,"
11117,214," the enormous masses of ice pass me and i pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions,"
11118,214," the white-topt mountains show in the distance, i fling out my fancies toward them,"
11119,214," we are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged,"
11120,214," we pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution,"
11121,214," or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,"
11122,214," the blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe,"
11123,214,
11124,214," i am a free companion, i bivouac by invading watchfires,"
11125,214," i turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,"
11126,214," i tighten her all night to my thighs and lips,"
11127,214,
11128,214," my voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,"
11129,214," they fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd,"
11130,214,
11131,214," i understand the large hearts of heroes,"
11132,214," the courage of present times and all times,"
11133,214," how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and death chasing it up and down the storm,"
11134,214," how he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,"
11135,214," and chalk'd in large letters on a board, be of good cheer, we will not desert you;"
11136,214," how he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days and would not give it up,"
11137,214," how he saved the drifting company at last,"
11138,214," how the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated from the side of their prepared graves,"
11139,214," how the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp'd unshaved men;"
11140,214," all this i swallow, it tastes good, i like it well, it becomes mine,"
11141,214," i am the man, i suffer'd, i was there,"
11142,214,
11143,214," the disdain and calmness of martyrs,"
11144,214," the mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on,"
11145,214," the hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover'd with sweat,"
11146,214," the twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the bullets,"
11147,214," all these i feel or am,"
11148,214,
11149,214," i am the hounded slave, i wince at the bite of the dogs,"
11150,214," hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,"
11151,214," i clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the ooze of my skin,"
11152,214," i fall on the weeds and stones,"
11153,214," the riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,"
11154,214," taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks,"
11155,214,
11156,214," agonies are one of my changes of garments,"
11157,214," i do not ask the wounded person how he feels, i myself become the wounded person,"
11158,214," my hurts turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observe,"
11159,214,
11160,214," i am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,"
11161,214," tumbling walls buried me in their debris,"
11162,214," heat and smoke i inspired, i heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,"
11163,214," i heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,"
11164,214," they have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth,"
11165,214,
11166,214," i lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,"
11167,214," painless after all i lie exhausted but not so unhappy,"
11168,214," white and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps,"
11169,214," the kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches,"
11170,214,
11171,214," distant and dead resuscitate,"
11172,214," they show as the dial or move as the hands of me, i am the clock myself,"
11173,214,
11174,214," i am an old artillerist, i tell of my fort's bombardment,"
11175,214," i am there again,"
11176,214,
11177,214," again the long roll of the drummers,"
11178,214," again the attacking cannon, mortars,"
11179,214," again to my listening ears the cannon responsive,"
11180,214,
11181,214," i take part, i see and hear the whole,"
11182,214," the cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,"
11183,214," the ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,"
11184,214," workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,"
11185,214," the fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,"
11186,214," the whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air,"
11187,214,
11188,214," again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand,"
11189,214," he gasps through the clot mind not me -- mind -- the entrenchments,"
11190,214,
11191,214," now i tell what i knew in texas in my early youth,"
11192,214," i tell not the fall of alamo,"
11193,214," not one escaped to tell the fall of alamo,"
11194,214," the hundred and fifty are dumb yet at alamo,"
11195,214," 'tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men,"
11196,214,
11197,214," retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,"
11198,214," nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance,"
11199,214," their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,"
11200,214," they treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners of war,"
11201,214,
11202,214," they were the glory of the race of rangers,"
11203,214," matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,"
11204,214," large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,"
11205,214," bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,"
11206,214," not a single one over thirty years of age,"
11207,214,
11208,214," the second first-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,"
11209,214," the work commenced about five o'clock and was over by eight,"
11210,214,
11211,214," none obey'd the command to kneel,"
11212,214," some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,"
11213,214," a few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together,"
11214,214," the maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,"
11215,214," some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,"
11216,214," these were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the blunts of muskets,"
11217,214," a youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two more came to release him,"
11218,214," the three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood,"
11219,214,
11220,214, at eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;
11221,214," that is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men,"
11222,214,
11223,214, would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
11224,214, would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
11225,214," list to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it to me,"
11226,214,
11227,214," our foe was no skulk in his ship i tell you, said he,"
11228,214," his was the surly english pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;"
11229,214," along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us,"
11230,214,
11231,214," we closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,"
11232,214," my captain lash'd fast with his own hands,"
11233,214,
11234,214," we had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,"
11235,214," on our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead,"
11236,214,
11237,214," fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,"
11238,214," ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,"
11239,214," the master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves,"
11240,214,
11241,214," the transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,"
11242,214," they see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust,"
11243,214,
11244,214," our frigate takes fire,"
11245,214, the other asks if we demand quarter?
11246,214, if our colors are struck and the fighting done?
11247,214,
11248,214," now i laugh content, for i hear the voice of my little captain,"
11249,214," we have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting,"
11250,214,
11251,214," only three guns are in use,"
11252,214," one is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's mainmast,"
11253,214," two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks,"
11254,214,
11255,214," the tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,"
11256,214," they hold out bravely during the whole of the action,"
11257,214,
11258,214," not a moment's cease,"
11259,214," the leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine,"
11260,214,
11261,214," one of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking,"
11262,214,
11263,214," serene stands the little captain,"
11264,214," he is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,"
11265,214," his eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns,"
11266,214,
11267,214," toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us,"
11268,214,
11269,214," stretch'd and still lies the midnight,"
11270,214," two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,"
11271,214," our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer'd,"
11272,214," the captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet,"
11273,214," near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,"
11274,214," the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl'd whiskers,"
11275,214," the flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,"
11276,214," the husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,"
11277,214," formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,"
11278,214," cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,"
11279,214," black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,"
11280,214," a few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,"
11281,214," delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,"
11282,214," the hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,"
11283,214," wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan,"
11284,214," these so, these irretrievable,"
11285,214,
11286,214, you laggards there on guard! look to your arms!
11287,214, in at the conquer'd doors they crowd! i am possess'd!
11288,214," embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,"
11289,214," see myself in prison shaped like another man,"
11290,214," and feel the dull unintermitted pain,"
11291,214,
11292,214," for me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,"
11293,214," it is i let out in the morning and barr'd at night,"
11294,214,
11295,214," not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but i am handcuff'd to him and walk by his side,"
11296,214," i am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips,"
11297,214,
11298,214," not a youngster is taken for larceny but i go up too, and am tried and sentenced,"
11299,214,
11300,214," not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but i also lie at the last gasp,"
11301,214," my face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat,"
11302,214,
11303,214," askers embody themselves in me and i am embodied in them,"
11304,214," i project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg,  "
11305,214,
11306,214, enough! enough! enough!
11307,214," somehow i have been stunn'd, stand back!"
11308,214," give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,"
11309,214," i discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake,"
11310,214,
11311,214, that i could forget the mockers and insults!
11312,214, that i could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers!
11313,214," that i could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning,"
11314,214,
11315,214," i remember now,"
11316,214," i resume the overstaid fraction,"
11317,214," the grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,"
11318,214," corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me,"
11319,214,
11320,214," i troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an average unending procession,"
11321,214," inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,"
11322,214," our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,"
11323,214," the blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years,"
11324,214,
11325,214," eleves, i salute you! come forward!"
11326,214," continue your annotations, continue your questionings,"
11327,214,
11328,214," the friendly and flowing savage, who is he?"
11329,214," is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?"
11330,214,
11331,214, is he some southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he kanadian?
11332,214," is he from the mississippi country? iowa, oregon, california?"
11333,214, the mountains? prairie-lif

11841,216,"        commotion,"
11842,216,"  with howling, desperate gulp of flower and bower,"
11843,216,"  with sonnet to matilda's eyebrow quite, quite frantic;"
11844,216,"  with gushing, sentimental reading circles turn'd to ice or stone;  "
11845,216,
11846,216,"  with many a squeak, in metre choice, from boston, new york,"
11847,216,"        philadelphia, london;"

11852,216,"  by thud of machinery and shrill steam-whistle undismay'd,"
11853,216,"  bluff'd not a bit by drain-pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers,"
11854,216,"  smiling and pleased, with palpable intent to stay,"
11855,216,"  she 's here, install'd amid the kitchen ware!"
11856,216,
11857,216,  but hold--don't i forget my manners?
11858,216,  to introduce the stranger what else indeed have i come for? to

11864,216,"  fear not, o muse! truly new ways and days receive, surround you,"
11865,216,"  i candidly confess, a queer, queer race, of novel fashion,"
11866,216,"  and yet the same old human race--the same within, without,"
11867,216,"  faces and hearts the same--feelings the same--yearnings the same,"
11868,216,"  the same old love--beauty and use the same,"
11869,216,
11870,216,"  we do not blame thee, elder world--nor separate ourselves from thee,"
11871,216,  would the son separate himself from the father?

11873,216,"        past ages bending, building,"
11874,216,"  we build to ours to-day,                                          "
11875,216,

11878,216,"  prouder than milan's statued, spired cathedral,"
11879,216,"  more picturesque than rhenish castle-keeps,"
11880,216,"  we plan, even now, to raise, beyond them all,"
11881,216,"  thy great cathedral, sacred industry--no tomb,"
11882,216,"  a keep for life for practical invention,"
11883,216,
11884,216,"  as in a waking vision,"
11885,216,"  e'en while i chant, i see it rise--i scan and prophesy outside and"

11924,216,"        shedding the printed leaves steady and fast,"
11925,216,"  the photograph, model, watch, pin, nail, shall be created before you,"

13535,229,"but away, at night, as you fly, none looking--o then the unloosen'd"
13536,229,"        ocean,"
13537,229,of tears! tears! tears!
13538,230,"all submit to them, where they sit, inner, secure, unapproachable to"
13539,230,"        analysis, in the soul;"
13540,230,not traditions--not the outer authorities are the judges--they are
13541,230,"        the judges of outer authorities, and of all traditions;"
13542,230,"they corroborate as they go, only whatever corroborates themselves,"
13543,230,        and touches themselves;
13544,230,"for all that, they have it forever in themselves to corroborate far"
13545,230,"        and near, without one exception,"
13546,231,"at the last, tenderly,"
13547,231,"from the walls of the powerful, fortress'd house,"
13548,231,from the clasp of the knitted locks--from the keep of the well-closed
13549,231,"        doors,"
13550,231,"let me be wafted,"
13551,231,
13552,231,let me glide noiselessly forth;
13553,231,"with the key of softness unlock the locks--with a whisper,"
13554,231,"set open the doors, o soul!"
13555,231,
13556,231,tenderly! be not impatient!
13557,231,"strong is your hold, o mortal flesh!"
13558,231,"strong is your hold, o love,"
13559,232,"that music always round me, unceasing, unbeginning--yet long untaught"
13560,232,        i did not hear;
13561,232,"but now the chorus i hear, and am elated;"
13562,232,"a tenor, strong, ascending, with power and health, with glad notes of"
13563,232,"        day-break i hear,"
13564,232,"a soprano, at intervals, sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense"
13565,232,"        waves,"
13566,232,"a transparent bass, shuddering lusciously under and through the"
13567,232,"        universe,"
13568,232,"the triumphant tutti--the funeral wailings, with sweet flutes and"
13569,232,        violins--all these i fill myself with;
13570,232,i hear not the volumes of sound merely--i am moved by the exquisite
13571,232,"        meanings,"
13572,232,"i listen to the different voices winding in and out, striving,"
13573,232,        contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion;
13574,232,i do not think the performers know themselves--but now i think i
13575,232,"        begin to know them,"
13576,233,"that shadow, my likeness, that goes to and fro, seeking a livelihood,"
13577,233,"        chattering, chaffering;"
13578,233,how often i find myself standing and looking at it where it flits;
13579,233,how often i question and doubt whether that is really me;
13580,233,"--but in these, and among my lovers, and caroling my songs,"
13581,233,"o i never doubt whether that is really me,"
13582,234,"while my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long,"
13583,234,"and my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant midnight"
13584,234,"        passes,"
13585,234,"and through the stillness, through the dark, i hear, just hear, the"
13586,234,"        breath of my infant,"
13587,234,"there in the room, as i wake from sleep, this vision presses upon me,"
13588,234,"the engagement opens there and then, in fantasy unreal;"
13589,234,the skirmishers begin--they crawl cautiously ahead--i hear the
13590,234,        irregular snap! snap!
13591,234,i hear the sounds of the different missiles--the short t-h-t! t-h-t!
13592,234,        of the rifle balls;
13593,234,"i see the shells exploding, leaving small white clouds--i hear the"
13594,234,        great shells shrieking as they pass;
13595,234,"the grape, like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees, quick,"
13596,234,"        tumultuous, now the contest rages!"
13597,234,all the scenes at the batteries themselves rise in detail before me
13598,234,        again;                                                      
13599,234,
13600,234,the crashing and smoking--the pride of the men in their pieces;
13601,234,"the chief gunner ranges and sights his piece, and selects a fuse of"
13602,234,        the right time;
13603,234,"after firing, i see him lean aside, and look eagerly off to note the"
13604,234,        effect;
13605,234,--elsewhere i hear the cry of a regiment charging--the young colonel
13606,234,"        leads himself this time, with brandish'd sword"
13607,234,"i see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, quickly fill'd up, no"
13608,234,        delay
13609,234,"i breathe the suffocating smoke--then the flat clouds hover low,"
13610,234,        concealing all;
13611,234,"now a strange lull comes for a few seconds, not a shot fired on"
13612,234,        either side;
13613,234,"then resumed, the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls, and"
13614,234,        orders of officers;
13615,234,while from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a
13616,234,"        shout of applause, some special success"
13617,234,"and ever the sound of the cannon, far or near, rousing, even in"
13618,234,"        dreams, a devilish exultation, and all the old mad joy, in the"
13619,234,        depths of my soul                                          
13620,234,
13621,234,"and ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions--batteries,"
13622,234,"        cavalry, moving hither and thither;"
13623,234,"the falling, dying, i heed not--the wounded, dripping and red, i"
13624,234,        heed not--some to the rear are hobbling
13625,234,"grime, heat, rush--aid-de-camps galloping by, or on a full run;"
13626,234,"with the patter of small arms, the warning s-s-t of the rifles,"
13627,234,"        these in my vision i hear or see,"
13628,234,"and bombs busting in air, and at night the vari-color'd rockets,"
13629,235,"and now, gentlemen,"
13630,235,"a word i give to remain in your memories and minds,"
13631,235,"as base, and finale too, for all metaphysics,"
13632,235,
13633,235,"so, to the students, the old professor,"
13634,235,"at the close of his crowded course,"
13635,235,
13636,235,"having studied the new and antique, the greek and germanic systems,"
13637,235,"kant having studied and stated--fichte and schelling and hegel,"
13638,235,"stated the lore of plato--and socrates, greater than plato,"
13639,235,and greater than socrates sought and stated--christ divine having
13640,235,"        studied long,"
13641,235,"i see reminiscent to-day those greek and germanic systems,        "
13642,235,
13643,235,"see the philosophies all--christian churches and tenets see,"
13644,235,yet underneath socrates clearly see--and underneath christ the divine
13645,235,"        i see,"
13646,235,the dear love of man for his comrade--the attraction of friend to
13647,235,"        friend,"
13648,235,"of the well-married husband and wife--of children and parents,"
13649,235,"of city for city, and land for land,"
13650,236,"give me your hand, old revolutionary;"
13651,236,"the hill-top is nigh--but a few steps, make room, gentlemen"
13652,236,"up the path you have follow'd me well, spite of your hundred and"
13653,236,        extra years;
13654,236,"you can walk, old man, though your eyes are almost done;"
13655,236,"your faculties serve you, and presently i must have them serve me,"
13656,236,
13657,236,"rest, while i tell what the crowd around us means;"
13658,236,"on the plain below, recruits are drilling and exercising;"
13659,236,there is the camp--one regiment departs to-morrow;
13660,236,do you hear the officers giving the orders?
13661,236,do you hear the clank of the muskets?                              
13662,236,
13663,236,"why, what comes over you now, old man?"
13664,236,"why do you tremble, and clutch my hand so convulsively?"
13665,236,the troops are but drilling--they are yet surrounded with smiles;
13666,236,"around them, at hand, the well-drest friends, and the women;"
13667,236,while splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down;
13668,236,"green the midsummer verdure, and fresh blows the dallying breeze,"
13669,236,"o'er proud and peaceful cities, and arm of the sea between,"
13670,236,but drill and parade are over--they march back to quarters;
13671,236,only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!
13672,236,
13673,236,"as wending, the crowds now part and disperse--but we, old man,    "
13674,236,
13675,236,not for nothing have i brought you hither--we must remain;
13676,236,"you to speak in your turn, and i to listen and tell,"
13677,236,
13678,236,"                           the centenarian,"
13679,236,
13680,236,"when i clutch'd your hand, it was not with terror;"
13681,236,"but suddenly, pouring about me here, on every side,"
13682,236,"and below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they"
13683,236,"        ran,"
13684,236,"and where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see, south and south-"
13685,236,"        east and south-west,"
13686,236,"over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,"
13687,236,"and along the shores, in mire now fill'd over, came again, and"
13688,236,"        suddenly raged,"
13689,236,"as eighty-five years agone, no mere parade receiv'd with applause of"
13690,236,"        friends,"
13691,236,"but a battle, which i took part in myself--aye, long ago as it is, i"
13692,236,"        took part in it,                                            "
13693,236,
13694,236,"walking then this hill-top, this same ground,"
13695,236,
13696,236,"aye, this is the ground;"
13697,236,"my blind eyes, even as i speak, behold it re-peopled from graves;"
13698,236,"the years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear;"
13699,236,"rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted;"
13700,236,i see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay;
13701,236,"i mark the vista of waters, i mark the uplands and slopes,"
13702,236,"here we lay encamp'd--it was this time in summer also,"
13703,236,
13704,236,"as i talk, i remember all--i remember the declaration;"
13705,236,it was read here--the whole army paraded--it was read to us here;  
13706,236,
13707,236,"by his staff surrounded, the general stood in the middle--he held up"
13708,236,"        his unsheath'd sword,"
13709,236,"it glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army,"
13710,236,
13711,236,'twas a bold act then;
13712,236,the english war-ships had just arrived--the king had sent them from
13713,236,        over the sea;
13714,236,"we could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,"
13715,236,"and the transports, swarming with soldiers,"
13716,236,
13717,236,"a few days more, and they landed--and then the battle,"
13718,236,
13719,236,"twenty thousand were brought against us,"
13720,236,"a veteran force, furnish'd with good artillery,"
13721,236,
13722,236,i tell not now the whole of the battle;                            
13723,236,
13724,236,"but one brigade, early in the forenoon, order'd forward to engage the"
13725,236,        red-coats;
13726,236,"of that brigade i tell, and how steadily it march'd,"
13727,236,"and how long and how well it stood, confronting death,"
13728,236,
13729,236,"who do you think that was, marching steadily, sternly confronting"
13730,236,        death?
13731,236,"it was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,"
13732,236,"rais'd in virginia and maryland, and many of them known personally to"
13733,236,"        the general,"
13734,236,
13735,236,jauntily forward they went with quick step toward gowanus' waters;
13736,236,"till of a sudden, unlook'd for, by defiles through the woods, gain'd"
13737,236,"        at night,"
13738,236,"the british advancing, wedging in from the east, fiercely playing"
13739,236,"        their guns,"
13740,236,"that brigade of the youngest was cut off, and at the enemy's"
13741,236,"        mercy,                                                      "
13742,236,
13743,236,the general watch'd them from this hill;
13744,236,they made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment;
13745,236,"then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the"
13746,236,        middle;
13747,236,but o from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!
13748,236,
13749,236,"it sickens me yet, that slaughter!"
13750,236,i saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the general;
13751,236,"i saw how he wrung his hands in anguish,"
13752,236,
13753,236,meanwhile the british maneuver'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle;
13754,236,"but we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle,"
13755,236,
13756,236,we fought the fight in detachments;                                
13757,236,
13758,236,"sallying forth, we fought at several points--but in each the luck was"
13759,236,        against us;
13760,236,"our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back to"
13761,236,        the works on this hill;
13762,236,"till we turn'd, menacing, here, and then he left us,"
13763,236,
13764,236,"that was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two"
13765,236,        thousand strong;
13766,236,"few return'd--nearly all remain in brooklyn,"
13767,236,
13768,236,"that, and here, my general's first battle;"
13769,236,"no women looking on, nor sunshine to bask in--it did not conclude"
13770,236,        with applause;
13771,236,"nobody clapp'd hands here then,"
13772,236,
13773,236,"but in darkness, in mist, on the ground, under a chill rain,"
13774,236,"wearied that night we lay, foil'd and sullen;                      "
13775,236,
13776,236,"while scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord, off against us"
13777,236,"        encamp'd,"
13778,236,"quite within hearing, feasting, klinking wine-glasses together over"
13779,236,"        their victory,"
13780,236,
13781,236,"so, dull and damp, and another day;"
13782,236,"but the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,"
13783,236,"silent as a ghost, while they thought they were sure of him, my"
13784,236,"        general retreated,"
13785,236,
13786,236,"i saw him at the river-side,"
13787,236,"down by the ferry, lit by torches, hastening the embarkation;"
13788,236,my general waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over;
13789,236,"and then, it was just ere sunrise, these eyes rested on him for the"
13790,236,"        last time,"
13791,236,
13792,236,every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom;                          
13793,236,
13794,236,"many no doubt thought of capitulation,"
13795,236,
13796,236,"but when my general pass'd me,"
13797,236,"as he stood in his boat, and look'd toward the coming sun,"
13798,236,"i saw something different from capitulation,"
13799,236,
13800,236,"                              terminus,"
13801,236,
13802,236,enough--the centenarian's story ends;
13803,236,"the two, the past and present, have interchanged;"
13804,236,"i myself, as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now"
13805,236,"        speaking,"
13806,236,
13807,236,and is this the ground washington trod?
13808,236,"and these waters i listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he"
13809,236,"        cross'd,"
13810,236,"as resolute in defeat, as other generals in their proudest"
13811,236,        triumphs?                                                  
13812,236,
13813,236,"it is well--a lesson like that, always comes good;"
13814,236,"i must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward;"
13815,236,"i must preserve that look, as it beam'd on you, rivers of brooklyn,"
13816,236,
13817,236,"see! as the annual round returns, the phantoms return;"
13818,236,"it is the 27th of august, and the british have landed;"
13819,236,"the battle begins, and goes against us--behold! through the smoke,"
13820,236,        washington's face;
13821,236,the brigade of virginia and maryland have march'd forth to intercept
13822,236,        the enemy;
13823,236,they are cut off--murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them;
13824,236,"rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,"
13825,236,"baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds,"
13826,236,
13827,236,"in death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears,"
13828,236,
13829,236,"ah, hills and slopes of brooklyn! i perceive you are more valuable"
13830,236,        than your owners supposed;
13831,236,"ah, river! henceforth you will be illumin'd to me at sunrise with"
13832,236,"        something besides the sun,"
13833,236,
13834,236,encampments new! in the midst of you stands an encampment very old;
13835,236,"stands forever the camp of the dead brigade,"
13836,237,"by the city dead-house, by the gate,"
13837,237,"as idly sauntering, wending my way from the clangor,"
13838,237,"i curious pause--for lo! an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute"
13839,237,        brought;
13840,237,her corpse they deposit unclaim'd--it lies on the damp brick
13841,237,        pavement;
13842,237,"the divine woman, her body--i see the body--i look on it alone,"
13843,237,that house once full of passion and beauty--all else i notice not;
13844,237,"nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odors"

14150,247,
14151,247,"  cries, help! o help! and wrings her hands;"
14152,247,"  blinded her eyes--bleeding her breast,"
14153,247,"  nor pardon finds, nor balm of rest,"
14154,247,
14155,247,"    o sight of shame, and pain, and dole!"
14156,247,    o fearful thought--a convict soul!
14157,247,
14158,247,"  ceaseless, she paces to and fro;"
14159,247,  o heart-sick days! o nights of wo!

14161,247,"  nor favor comes, nor word of grace,"
14162,247,
14163,247,"    o sight of pity, gloom, and dole!                                "
14164,247,
14165,247,"    o pardon me, a hapless soul!"
14166,247,
14167,247,"  it was not i that sinn'd the sin,"
14168,247,  the ruthless body dragg'd me in;
14169,247,"  though long i strove courageously,"
14170,247,"  the body was too much for me,"
14171,247,
14172,247,"    o life! no life, but bitter dole!"
14173,247,"    o burning, beaten, baffled soul!"
14174,247,
14175,247,"  dear prison'd soul, bear up a space,"
14176,247,  for soon or late the certain grace;
14177,247,"  to set thee free, and bear thee home,                              "
14178,247,

14182,247,    depart! a god-enfranchis'd soul!
14183,247,
14184,247,  the singer ceas'd;
14185,247,"  one glance swept from her clear, calm eyes, o'er all those upturn'd"
14186,247,        faces;
14187,247,"  strange sea of prison faces--a thousand varied, crafty, brutal,"
14188,247,        seam'd and beauteous faces;
14189,247,"  then rising, passing back along the narrow aisle between them,"
14190,247,"  while her gown touch'd them, rustling in the silence,"
14191,247,"  she vanish'd with her children in the dusk,"
14192,247,
14193,247,"  while upon all, convicts and armed keepers, ere they stirr'd,      "
14194,247,
14195,247,"  convict forgetting prison, keeper his loaded pistol,"
14196,247,"  a hush and pause fell down, a wondrous minute,"
14197,247,"  with deep, half-stifled sobs, and sound of bad men bow'd, and moved"
14198,247,"        to weeping,"
14199,247,"  and youth's convulsive breathings, memories of home,"
14200,247,"  the mother's voice in lullaby, the sister's care, the happy"
14201,247,"        childhood,"
14202,247,  the long-pent spirit rous'd to reminiscence;
14203,247,"  --a wondrous minute then--but after, in the solitary night, to many,"
14204,247,"        many there,"
14205,247,"  years after--even in the hour of death--the sad refrain--the tune,"
14206,247,"        the voice, the words,"
14207,247,"  resumed--the large, calm lady walks the narrow aisle,"
14208,247,"  the wailing melody again--the singer in the prison sings,          "
14209,247,
14210,247,"    o sight of shame, and pain, and dole!"
14211,247,    o fearful thought--a convict soul!

14213,248,"stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and"
14214,248,"        stopping,"
14215,248,"bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,"
14216,248,"wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,"
14217,248,"pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping,"
14218,248,
14219,248,"how solemn they look there, stretch'd and still!"
14220,248,"how quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles!"
14221,248,
14222,248,"the wretched features of ennuyés, the white features of"
14223,248,"        corpses, the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of"
14224,248,"        onanists,"
14225,248,"the gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their strong-door'd"

14354,248,his brown hair lies close and even to his head--he strikes out with
14355,248,"        courageous arms--he urges himself with his legs,"

14807,257,"here, out of my pocket, some moss which i pull'd off a live-oak in"

15374,287,
15375,287,"the rosy and elastic dawn, the flashing sun,"
15376,287,"the limpid spread of air cerulean,"

15378,287,
15379,287,"thou born to match the gale, thou art all wings,"
15380,287,"to cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurricane,"
15381,287,"thou ship of air that never furl'st thy sails,"
15382,287,"days, even weeks untired and onward, through spaces, realms gyrating,"
15383,287,"at dusk that look'st on senegal, at morn america,"
15384,287,"that sport'st amid the lightning-flash and thunder-cloud,"
15385,287,"in them, in thy experience, had'st thou my soul,                  "
15386,287,
15387,287,what joys! what joys were thine!
15388,288,"now, dearest comrade, lift me to your face,"
15389,288,"we must separate awhile--here! take from my lips this kiss,"
15390,288,"whoever you are, i give it especially to you;"
15391,288,"so long!--and i hope we shall meet again,"
15392,289,"why reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing?"
15393,289,what deepening twilight! scum floating atop of the waters!
15394,289,"who are they, as bats and night-dogs, askant in the capitol?"
15395,289,"what a filthy presidentiad! o south, your torrid suns! o north, your"
15396,289,        arctic freezings!
15397,289,are those really congressmen? are those the great judges? is that the
15398,289,        president?
15399,289,"then i will sleep awhile yet--for i see that these states sleep, for"
15400,289,        reasons;
15401,289,"with gathering murk--with muttering thunder and lambent shoots, we"
15402,289,"        all duly awake,"
15403,289,"south, north, east, west, inland and seaboard, we will surely awake,"
15404,290,"to thee, old cause!"
15405,290,"thou peerless, passionate, good cause!"
15406,290,"thou stern, remorseless, sweet idea!"
15407,290,"deathless throughout the ages, races, lands!"
15408,290,"after a strange, sad war--great war for thee,"
15409,290,"i think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be"
15410,290,"        really fought, for thee; "
15411,290,"these chants for thee--the eternal march of thee,"
15412,290,
15413,290,thou orb of many orbs!
15414,290,"thou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre!"
15415,290,"around the idea of thee the strange sad war revolving,            "
15416,290,
15417,290,"with all its angry and vehement play of causes,"
15418,290,"with yet unknown results to come, for thrice a thousand years,"
15419,290,"these recitatives for thee--my book and the war are one,"
15420,290,"merged in its spirit i and mine--as the contest hinged on thee,"
15421,290,"as a wheel on its axis turns, this book, unwitting to itself,"
15422,290,"around the idea of thee,"
15423,291,to think of time--of all that retrospection!
15424,291,"to think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward!"
15425,291,
15426,291,  have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?
15427,291,  have you dreaded these earth-beetles?
15428,291,  have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?
15429,291,
15430,291,is to-day nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?
15431,291,"if the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing,"
15432,291,
15433,291,  to think that the sun rose in the east! that men and women were
15434,291,"        flexible, real, alive! that everything was alive!"
15435,291,"  to think that you and i did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part!"
15436,291,"  to think that we are now here, and bear our part!                  "
15437,291,
15438,291,"  not a day passes--not a minute or second, without an accouchement!"
15439,291,"  not a day passes--not a minute or second, without a corpse!"
15440,291,
15441,291,"  the dull nights go over, and the dull days also,"
15442,291,"  the soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,"
15443,291,"  the physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible"
15444,291,"        look for an answer,"
15445,291,"  the children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters"
15446,291,"        are sent for,"
15447,291,  medicines stand unused on the shelf--the camphor-smell has long
15448,291,"        pervaded the rooms,"
15449,291,  the faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the
15450,291,"        dying,"
15451,291,"  the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,"
15452,291,"  the breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases,              "
15453,291,
15454,291,"  the corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it,"
15455,291,"  it is palpable as the living are palpable,"
15456,291,
15457,291,"  the living look upon the corpse with their eye-sight,"
15458,291,"  but without eye-sight lingers a different living, and looks curiously"
15459,291,"        on the corpse,"
15460,291,
15461,291,"  to think the thought of death, merged in the thought of materials!"
15462,291,"  to think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and fruits"
15463,291,"        ripen, and act upon others as upon us now--yet not act upon us!"
15464,291,"  to think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking"
15465,291,        great interest in them--and we taking no interest in them!
15466,291,
15467,291,  to think how eager we are in building our houses!
15468,291,"  to think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent!"
15469,291,
15470,291,"  i see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy"
15471,291,"        or eighty years at most,                                    "
15472,291,
15473,291,"  i see one building the house that serves him longer than that,"
15474,291,
15475,291,  slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth--they never
15476,291,"        cease--they are the burial lines,"
15477,291,"  he that was president was buried, and he that is now president shall"
15478,291,"        surely be buried,"
15479,291,
15480,291,"  a reminiscence of the vulgar fate,"
15481,291,"  a frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,"
15482,291,"  each after his kind,"
15483,291,"  cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf--posh and ice in the river,"
15484,291,"        half-frozen mud in the streets, a gray, discouraged sky"
15485,291,"        overhead, the short, last daylight of twelfth-month,"
15486,291,  a hearse and stages--other vehicles give place--the funeral of an old
15487,291,"        broadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers,"
15488,291,
15489,291,"  steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, the"
15490,291,"        gate is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living"
15491,291,"        alight, the hearse uncloses,"
15492,291,"  the coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on"
15493,291,"        the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,                "
15494,291,
15495,291,"  the mound above is flatted with the spades--silence,"
15496,291,"  a minute--no one moves or speaks--it is done,"
15497,291,  he is decently put away--is there anything more?
15498,291,
15499,291,"  he was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not bad-looking,"
15500,291,"        able to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready"
15501,291,"        with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate"
15502,291,"        hearty, drank hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew"
15503,291,"        low-spirited toward the last, sicken'd, was help'd by a"
15504,291,"        contribution, died, aged forty-one years--and that was his"
15505,291,"        funeral,"
15506,291,
15507,291,"  thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet-"
15508,291,"        weather clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter,"
15509,291,"        hostler, somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody,"
15510,291,"        headway, man before and man behind, good day's work, bad day's"
15511,291,"        work, pet stock, mean stock, first out, last out, turning-in at"
15512,291,        night;
15513,291,  to think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers--and he
15514,291,        there takes no interest in them!
15515,291,
15516,291,"  the markets, the government, the working-man's wages--to think what"
15517,291,        account they are through our nights and days!
15518,291,  to think that other working-men will make just as great account of
15519,291,        them--yet we make little or no account!
15520,291,
15521,291,"  the vulgar and the refined--what you call sin, and what you call"
15522,291,        goodness--to think how wide a difference!
15523,291,"  to think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie"
15524,291,"        beyond the difference,                                      "
15525,291,
15526,291,  to think how much pleasure there is!
15527,291,  have you pleasure from looking at the sky? have you pleasure from
15528,291,        poems?
15529,291,  do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or
15530,291,        planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and
15531,291,        family?
15532,291,  or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the
15533,291,        beautiful maternal cares?
15534,291,"  --these also flow onward to others--you and i flow onward,"
15535,291,"  but in due time, you and i shall take less interest in them,"
15536,291,
15537,291,"  your farm, profits, crops,--to think how engross'd you are!"
15538,291,"  to think there will still be farms, profits, crops--yet for you, of"
15539,291,        what avail?
15540,291,
15541,291,"  what will be, will be well--for what is, is well,"
15542,291,"  to take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well,  "
15543,291,
15544,291,"  the sky continues beautiful,"
15545,291,"  the pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure"
15546,291,"        of women with men, nor the pleasure from poems,"
15547,291,"  the domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of"
15548,291,"        houses--these are not phantasms--they have weight, form,"
15549,291,        location;
15550,291,"  farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them"
15551,291,"        phantasms,"
15552,291,"  the difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,"
15553,291,"  the earth is not an echo--man and his life, and all the things of his"
15554,291,"        life, are well-consider'd,"
15555,291,
15556,291,  you are not thrown to the winds--you gather certainly and safely
15557,291,        around yourself;
15558,291,"  yourself! yourself! yourself, forever and ever!"
15559,291,
15560,291,  it is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and
15561,291,        father--it is to identify you;
15562,291,"  it is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be"
15563,291,        decided;                                                    
15564,291,
15565,291,"  something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you,"
15566,291,"  you are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes,"
15567,291,
15568,291,"  the threads that were spun are gather'd, the weft crosses the warp,"
15569,291,"        the pattern is systematic,"
15570,291,
15571,291,"  the preparations have every one been justified,"
15572,291,  the orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments--the baton
15573,291,"        has given the signal,"
15574,291,
15575,291,"  the guest that was coming--he waited long, for reasons--he is now"
15576,291,"        housed,"
15577,291,  he is one of those who are beautiful and happy--he is one of those
15578,291,"        that to look upon and be with is enough,"

15580,291,"  the law of the past cannot be eluded,"
15581,291,"  the law of the present and future cannot be eluded,"

15583,291,
15584,291,"  the law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,"
15585,291,"  the law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,"
15586,291,"  the law of drunkards, informers, mean persons--not one iota thereof"

15593,291,
15594,291,  the great masters and kosmos are well as they go--the heroes and
15595,291,"        good-doers are well,"
15596,291,"  the known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and"
15597,291,"        distinguish'd, may be well,"
15598,291,"  but there is more account than that--there is strict account of all,"
15599,291,
15600,291,"  the interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,"
15601,291,"  the barbarians of africa and asia are not nothing,                "
15602,291,
15603,291,  the common people of europe are not nothing--the american aborigines
15604,291,"        are not nothing,"
15605,291,  the infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing--the murderer
15606,291,"        or mean person is not nothing,"
15607,291,  the perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they
15608,291,"        go,"
15609,291,  the lowest prostitute is not nothing--the mocker of religion is not
15610,291,"        nothing as he goes,"
15611,291,
15612,291,"  of and in all these things,"
15613,291,"  i have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of"
15614,291,"        us changed,"
15615,291,  i have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present
15616,291,"        and past law,"
15617,291,"  and that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and"
15618,291,"        past law,"
15619,291,"  for i have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough,"

15626,291,"  do you suspect death? if i were to suspect death, i should die now,"
15627,291,  do you think i could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward
15628,291,        annihilation?
15629,291,
15630,291,"  pleasantly and well-suited i walk,"

15981,308,pronunciations in the sound of your name?
15982,309,"what best i see in thee,"
15983,309,"is not that where thou mov'st down history's great highways,"
15984,309,"ever undimm'd by time shoots warlike victory's dazzle,"
15985,309,"or that thou sat'st where washington sat, ruling the land in peace,"

15987,309,"        upon,"
15988,309,who walk'd with kings with even pace the round world's promenade;
15989,309,"but that in foreign lands, in all thy walks with kings,"
15990,309,"those prairie sovereigns of the west, kansas, missouri, illinois,"
15991,309,"ohio's, indiana's millions, comrades, farmers, soldiers, all to the"
15992,309,"        front,"

15995,309,
15996,309,"we all so justified,"
15997,310,"what general has a good army in himself, has a good army;"
15998,310,"he happy in himself, or she happy in herself, is happy,"
15999,310,"but i tell you you cannot be happy by others, any more than you can"
16000,310,"        beget or conceive a child by others,"
16001,311,"what place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?"
16002,311,"lo! i send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal;"
16003,311,"and with him horse and foot--and parks of artillery,"
16004,311,"and artillery-men, the deadliest that ever fired gun,"
16005,312,what think you i take my pen in hand to record?
16006,312,"the battle-ship, perfect-model'd, majestic, that i saw pass the"
16007,312,        offing to-day under full sail?
16008,312,the splendors of the past day? or the splendor of the night that
16009,312,        envelopes me?
16010,312,or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me?--
16011,312,        no;
16012,312,"but i record of two simple men i saw to-day, on the pier, in the"
16013,312,"        midst of the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends;"
16014,312,"the one to remain hung on the other's neck, and passionately kiss'd"
16015,312,"        him,"
16016,312,"while the one to depart, tightly prest the one to remain in his arms,"
16017,313,what weeping face is that looking from the window?
16018,313,why does it stream those sorrowful tears?
16019,313,"is it for some burial place, vast and dry?"
16020,313,is it to wet the soil of graves?
16021,314,when i heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv'd
16022,314,"        with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night"
16023,314,        for me that follow'd;
16024,314,"and else, when i carous'd, or when my plans were accomplish'd, still"
16025,314,        i was not happy;
16026,314,"but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health,"
16027,314,"        refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,"
16028,314,when i saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the
16029,314,"        morning light,"
16030,314,"when i wander'd alone over the beach, and undressing, bathed,"
16031,314,"        laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,"
16032,314,"and when i thought how my dear friend, my lover, was on his way"
16033,314,"        coming, o then i was happy;"
16034,314,o then each breath tasted sweeter--and all that day my food nourish'd
16035,314,"        me more--and the beautiful day pass'd well,"
16036,314,"and the next came with equal joy--and with the next, at evening, came"
16037,314,        my friend;
16038,314,"and that night, while all was still, i heard the waters roll slowly"
16039,314,"        continually up the shores,"
16040,314,"i heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as directed to"
16041,314,"        me, whispering, to congratulate me,                          "
16042,314,
16043,314,for the one i love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in
16044,314,"        the cool night,"
16045,314,"in the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was inclined"
16046,314,"        toward me,"
16047,314,"and his arm lay lightly around my breast--and that night i was happy,"
16048,315,when i heard the learn'd astronomer;
16049,315,"when the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me;"
16050,315,"when i was shown the charts and the diagrams, to add, divide, and"
16051,315,        measure them;
16052,315,"when i, sitting, heard the astronomer, where he lectured with much"
16053,315,"        applause in the lecture-room,"
16054,315,"how soon, unaccountable, i became tired and sick;"
16055,315,"till rising and gliding out, i wander'd off by myself,"
16056,315,"in the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,"
16057,315,"look'd up in perfect silence at the stars,"
16058,316,"when i peruse the conquer'd fame of heroes, and the victories of"
16059,316,"        mighty generals, i do not envy the generals,"
16060,316,"nor the president in his presidency, nor the rich in his great house;"
16061,316,"but when i hear of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them,"
16062,316,"how through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long and long,"
16063,316,"through youth, and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how"
16064,316,"        affectionate and faithful they were,"
16065,316,"then i am pensive--i hastily walk away, fill'd with the bitterest"
16066,316,"        envy,"
16067,317,"when i read the book, the biography famous,"
16068,317,"and is this, then, said i, what the author calls a man's life?"
16069,317,"and so will some one, when i am dead and gone, write my life?"
16070,317,as if any man really knew aught of my life;
16071,317,"why, even i myself, i often think, know little or nothing of my real"
16072,317,        life;
16073,317,"only a few hints--a few diffused, faint clues and indirections,"
16074,317,"i seek, for my own use, to trace out here,"
16075,318,", when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd,"
16076,318,"  and the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night,"
16077,318,"  i mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring,"
16078,318,"  ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,"
16079,318,"  lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,"
16080,318,"  and thought of him i love,"
16081,318,
16082,318,  o powerful western fallen star!
16083,318,"  o shades of night -- o moody, tearful night!"
16084,318,  o great star disappear'd -- o the black murk that hides the star!
16085,318, o cruel hands that hold me powerless -- o helpless soul of me!
16086,318," o harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul,"
16087,318,
16088,318," in the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd palings,"
16089,318," stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green,"
16090,318," with many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong i love,"
16091,318,"  with every leaf a miracle -- and from this bush in the dooryard,"
16092,318," with delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,"
16093,318," a sprig with its flower i break,"
16094,318,
16095,318," in the swamp in secluded recesses,"
16096,318," a shy and hidden bird is warbling a song,"
16097,318,
16098,318," solitary the thrush,"
16099,318," the hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,"
16100,318," sings by himself a song,"
16101,318,
16102,318," song of the bleeding throat,"
16103,318," death's outlet song of life, for well dear brother i know,"
16104,318," if thou wast not granted to sing thou would'st surely die,"
16105,318,
16106,318," over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,"
16107,318," amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd from the ground, spotting the gray debris,"
16108,318," amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass,"
16109,318," passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen,"
16110,318," passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,"
16111,318," carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,"
16112,318," night and day journeys a coffin,"
16113,318,
16114,318," coffin that passes through lanes and streets,"
16115,318," through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land,"
16116,318," with the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in black,"
16117,318," with the show of the states themselves as of crape-veil'd women standing,"
16118,318," with processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,"
16119,318," with the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads,"
16120,318," with the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,"
16121,318," with dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn,"
16122,318," with all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin,"
16123,318," the dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs -- where amid these you journey,"
16124,318," with the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,"
16125,318," here, coffin that slowly passes,"
16126,318," i give you my sprig of lilac,"
16127,318,
16128,318," nor for you, for one alone,"
16129,318," blossoms and branches green to coffins all i bring,"
16130,318," for fresh as the morning, thus would i chant a song for you o sane and sacred death,"
16131,318,
16132,318," all over bouquets of roses,"
16133,318," o death, i cover you over with roses and early lilies,"
16134,318," but mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,"
16135,318," copious i break, i break the sprigs from the bushes,"
16136,318," with loaded arms i come, pouring for you,"
16137,318," for you and the coffins all of you o death,"
16138,318,
16139,318," o western orb sailing the heaven,"
16140,318," now i know what you must have meant as a month since i walk'd,"
16141,318," as i walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,"
16142,318," as i saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,"
16143,318," as you droop'd from the sky low down as if to my side, while the other stars all look'd on,"
16144,318," as we wander'd together the solemn night, for something i know not what kept me from sleep,"
16145,318," as the night advanced, and i saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe,"
16146,318," as i stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night,"
16147,318," as i watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black of the night,"
16148,318," as my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,"
16149,318," concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone,"
16150,318,
16151,318," sing on there in the swamp,"
16152,318," o singer bashful and tender, i hear your notes, i hear your call,"
16153,318," i hear, i come presently, i understand you,"
16154,318," but a moment i linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me,"
16155,318," the star my departing comrade holds and detains me,"
16156,318,
16157,318, o how shall i warble myself for the dead one there i loved?
16158,318, and how shall i deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?
16159,318, and what shall my perfume be for the grave of him i love?
16160,318,
16161,318," sea-winds blown from east and west,"
16162,318," blown from the eastern sea and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies meeting,"
16163,318," these and with these and the breath of my chant,"
16164,318," i'll perfume the grave of him i love,"
16165,318,
16166,318, o what shall i hang on the chamber walls?
16167,318," and what shall the pictures be that i hang on the walls,"
16168,318, to adorn the burial-house of him i love?
16169,318,
16170,318," pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,"
16171,318," with the fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,"
16172,318," with floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air,"
16173,318," with the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific,"
16174,318," in the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there,"
16175,318," with ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows,"
16176,318," and the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,"
16177,318," and all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning,"
16178,318,
16179,318," lo, body and soul -- this land,"
16180,318," my own manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships,"
16181,318," the varied and ample land, the south and the north in the light, ohio's shores and flashing missouri,"
16182,318," and ever the far-spreading prairies cover'd with grass and corn,"
16183,318,
16184,318," lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,"
16185,318," the violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,"
16186,318," the gentle soft-born measureless light,"
16187,318," the miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill'd noon,"
16188,318," the coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,"
16189,318," over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land,"
16190,318,
16191,318," sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,"
16192,318," sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,"
16193,318," limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines,"
16194,318,
16195,318," sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,"
16196,318," loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe,"
16197,318,
16198,318, o liquid and free and tender!
16199,318, o wild and loose to my soul -- o wondrous singer!
16200,318," you only i hear -- yet the star holds me, but will soon depart,"
16201,318," yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me,"
16202,318,
16203,318," now while i sat in the day and look'd forth,"
16204,318," in the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their crops,"
16205,318," in the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests,"
16206,318," in the heavenly aerial beauty, after the perturb'd winds and the storms,"
16207,318," under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women,"
16208,318," the many-moving sea-tides, and i saw the ships how they sail'd,"
16209,318," and the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor,"
16210,318," and the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages,"
16211,318," and the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent -- lo, then and there,"
16212,318," falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,"
16213,318," appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail,"
16214,318," and i knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death,"
16215,318,
16216,318," then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,"
16217,318," and the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,"
16218,318," and i in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,"
16219,318," i fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,"
16220,318," down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,"
16221,318," to the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still,"
16222,318,
16223,318," and the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me,"
16224,318," the gray-brown bird i know receiv'd us comrades three,"
16225,318," and he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him i love,"
16226,318,
16227,318," from deep secluded recesses,"
16228,318," from the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,"
16229,318," came the carol of the bird,"
16230,318,
16231,318," and the charm of the carol rapt me,"
16232,318," as i held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,"
16233,318," and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird,"
16234,318,
16235,318," come lovely and soothing death,"
16236,318," undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,"
16237,318," in the day, in the night, to all, to each,"
16238,318," sooner or later delicate death,"
16239,318,
16240,318," prais'd be the fathomless universe,"
16241,318," for life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,"
16242,318," and for love, sweet love -- but praise! praise! praise!"
16243,318," for the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death,"
16244,318,
16245,318," dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,"
16246,318, have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
16247,318," then i chant it for thee, i glorify thee above all,"
16248,318," i bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly,"
16249,318,
16250,318," approach strong deliveress,"
16251,318," when it is so, when thou hast taken them i joyously sing the dead,"
16252,318," lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,"
16253,318," laved in the flood of thy bliss o death,"
16254,318,
16255,318," from me to thee glad serenades,"
16256,318," dances for thee i propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee,"
16257,318," and the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting,"
16258,318," and life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night,"
16259,318,
16260,318," the night in silence under many a star,"
16261,318," the ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice i know,"
16262,318," and the soul turning to thee o vast and well-veil'd death,"
16263,318," and the body gratefully nestling close to thee,"
16264,318,
16265,318," over the tree-tops i float thee a song,"
16266,318," over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide,"
16267,318," over the dense-pack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,"
16268,318," i float this carol with joy, with joy to thee o death,"
16269,318,
16270,318," to the tally of my soul,"
16271,318," loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,"
16272,318," with pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night,"
16273,318,
16274,318," loud in the pines and cedars dim,"
16275,318," clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,"
16276,318," and i with my comrades there in the night,"
16277,318,
16278,318," while my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,"
16279,318," as to long panoramas of visions,"
16280,318,
16281,318," and i saw askant the armies,"
16282,318," i saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,"
16283,318," borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles i saw them,"
16284,318," and carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,"
16285,318," and at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, and all in silence,"
16286,318," and the staffs all splinter'd and broken,"
16287,318,
16288,318," i saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,"
16289,318," and the white skeletons of young men, i saw them,"
16290,318," i saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,"
16291,318," but i saw they were not as was thought,"
16292,318," they themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,"
16293,318," the living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,"
16294,318," and the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,"
16295,318," and the armies that remain'd suffer'd,"
16296,318,
16297,318," passing the visions, passing the night,"
16298,318," passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,"
16299,318," passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,"
16300,318," victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,"
16301,318," as low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night,"
16302,318," sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy,"
16303,318," covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,"
16304,318," as that powerful psalm in the night i heard from recesses,"
16305,318," passing, i leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,"
16306,318," i leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring,"
16307,318,
16308,318," i cease from my song for thee,"
16309,318," from my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,"
16310,318," o comrade lustrous with silver face in the night,"
16311,318,
16312,318," yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,"
16313,318," the song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,"
16314,318," and the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,"
16315,318," with the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,"
16316,318," with the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,"
16317,318," comrades mine and i in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead i loved so well,"
16318,318," for the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands -- and this for his dear sake,"
16319,318," lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,"
16320,318," there in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim,"
16321,319,"whispers of heavenly death, murmur'd i hear;"
16322,319,labial gossip of night--sibilant chorals;
16323,319,"footsteps gently ascending--mystical breezes, wafted soft and low;"
16324,319,"ripples of unseen rivers--tides of a current, flowing, forever"
16325,319,        flowing;
16326,319,or is it the plashing of tears? the measureless waters of human
16327,319,        tears?
16328,319,
16329,319,"i see, just see, skyward, great cloud-masses;"
16330,319,"mournfully, slowly they roll, silently swelling and mixing;"
16331,319,"with, at times, a half-dimm'd, sadden'd, far-off star,"
16332,319,"appearing and disappearing,"
16333,319,
16334,319,"some parturition, rather--some solemn, immortal birth,            "

16340,320,"or may-be a stranger is reading this who has secretly loved me,"
16341,320,or may-be one who meets all my grand assumptions and egotisms with
16342,320,"        derision,"
16343,320,"or may-be one who is puzzled at me,"
16344,320,
16345,320,as if i were not puzzled at myself!

16353,321,who learns my lesson complete?
16354,321,"boss, journeyman, apprentice--churchman and atheist,"
16355,321,"the stupid and the wise thinker--parents and offspring--merchant,"

16375,321,        untruth of a single second;

16385,321,is it wonderful that i should be immortal? as every one is immortal;
16386,321,"i know it is wonderful, but my eyesight is equally wonderful, and how"
16387,321,        i was conceived in my mother's womb is equally wonderful;    
16388,321,
16389,321,"and pass'd from a babe, in the creeping trance of a couple of summers"
16390,321,"        and winters, to articulate and walk--all this is equally"
16391,321,"        wonderful,"

16397,321,"and that i can think such thoughts as these, is just as wonderful;"
16398,321,"and that i can remind you, and you think them, and know them to be"
16399,321,"        true, is just as wonderful,"
16400,321,
16401,321,"and that the moon spins round the earth, and on with the earth, is"
16402,321,"        equally wonderful,"
16403,321,"and that they balance themselves with the sun and stars, is equally"

16412,322,
16413,322,"the way is suspicious--the result uncertain, perhaps destructive;"
16414,322,you would have to give up all else--i alone would expect to be your
16415,322,"        god, sole and exclusive,"
16416,322,"your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,"
16417,322,"the whole past theory of your life, and all conformity to the lives"

16423,322,
16424,322,"or else, by stealth, in some wood, for trial,"
16425,322,"or back of a rock, in the open air,"
16426,322,"for in any roof'd room of a house i emerge not--nor in company,"
16427,322,"and in libraries i lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,"

16433,322,"with the comrade's long-dwelling kiss, or the new husband's kiss,  "
16434,322,

16439,322,carry me when you go forth over land or sea;
16440,322,"for thus, merely touching you, is enough--is best,"
16441,322,"and thus, touching you, would i silently sleep and be carried"
16442,322,"        eternally,"
16443,322,
16444,322,"but these leaves conning, you con at peril,"
16445,322,"for these leaves, and me, you will not understand,"
16446,322,"they will elude you at first, and still more afterward--i will"
16447,322,"        certainly elude you,"
16448,322,"even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me,"
16449,322,        behold!                                                      
16450,322,
16451,322,"already you see i have escaped from you,"
16452,322,
16453,322,for it is not for what i have put into it that i have written this
16454,322,"        book,"
16455,322,"nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,"
16456,322,"nor do those know me best who admire me, and vauntingly praise me,"
16457,322,"nor will the candidates for my love, unless at most a very few,"
16458,322,"        prove victorious,"
16459,322,"nor will my poems do good only--they will do just as much evil,"
16460,322,        perhaps more;

16462,322,        not hit--that which i hinted at;

16487,324,

16604,328,        stage;
16605,328,"have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the acts"
16606,328,        suitable to them closed?
16607,328,"i see freedom, completely arm'd, and victorious, and very haughty,"
16608,328,"        with law on one side, and peace on the other,"
16609,328,"a stupendous trio, all issuing forth against the idea of caste;"
16610,328,--what historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?
16611,328,i see men marching and countermarching by swift millions;          
16612,328,
16613,328,i see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken;
16614,328,i see the landmarks of european kings removed;
16615,328,"i see this day the people beginning their landmarks, all others give"
16616,328,        way
16617,328,--never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day;
16618,328,"never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a god;"
16619,328,"lo! how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest;"
16620,328,his daring foot is on land and sea everywhere--he colonizes the
16621,328,"        pacific, the archipelagoes;"
16622,328,"with the steam-ship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the"
16623,328,"        wholesale engines of war,"
16624,328,"with these, and the world-spreading factories, he interlinks all"
16625,328,"        geography, all lands;"
16626,328,"--what whispers are these, o lands, running ahead of you, passing"
16627,328,        under the seas?                                              
16628,328,
16629,328,are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the
16630,328,        globe?
16631,328,"is humanity forming, en-masse?--for lo! tyrants tremble, crowns grow"
16632,328,        dim;
16633,328,"the earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine"
16634,328,        war;
16635,328,no one knows what will happen next--such portents fill the days and
16636,328,        nights;
16637,328,"years prophetical! the space ahead as i walk, as i vainly try to"
16638,328,"        pierce it, is full of phantoms;"
16639,328,"unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me;"
16640,328,"this incredible rush and heat--this strange extatic fever of dreams,"
16641,328,        o years!
16642,328,"your dreams, o year, how they penetrate through me! i know not"
16643,328,        whether i sleep or wake!
16644,328,"the perform'd america and europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind"
16645,328,"        me,"
16646,328,"the unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon"
16647,328,"        me,"
16648,329,"yet, yet, ye downcast hours, i know ye also;"
16649,329,"weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at my ankles!"
16650,329,"earth to a chamber of mourning turns--i hear the o'er weening, mocking"
16651,329,"        voice,"
16652,329,"matter is conqueror--matter, triumphant only, continues onward,"
16653,329,
16654,329,"despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me,"
16655,329,"the call of my nearest lover, putting forth, alarm'd, uncertain,"
16656,329,"the sea i am quickly to sail, come tell me,"
16657,329,"come tell me where i am speeding--tell me my destination,"
16658,329,
16659,329,"i understand your anguish, but i cannot help you,"
16660,329,"i approach, hear, behold--the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes,"
16661,329,"        your mute inquiry,                                          "
16662,329,
16663,329,"whither i go from the bed i recline on, come tell me,"
16664,329,"old age, alarm'd, uncertain--a young woman's voice, appealing to me"
16665,329,        for comfort;
16666,329,"a young man's voice, shall i not escape?"
