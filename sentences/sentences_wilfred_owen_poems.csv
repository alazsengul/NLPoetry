122,4,
123,4,merry it was to laugh there--
124,4,"where death becomes absurd and life absurder,"
125,4,for power was on us as we slashed bones bare

127,4,
128,4,"i, too, have dropped off fear--"
129,4,"behind the barrage, dead as my platoon,"
130,4,"and sailed my spirit surging, light and clear,"
131,4,past the entanglement where hopes lie strewn;
132,4,
133,4,and witnessed exhultation--

137,4,
138,4,i have made fellowships--

142,4,
143,4,"by joy, whose ribbon slips,--"
144,4,but wound with war's hard wire whose stakes are strong;
145,4,bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;
146,4,"knit in the welding of the rifle-thong,"
147,4,
148,4,i have perceived much beauty
149,4,in the hoarse oaths that kept our courage straight;

152,4,
153,4,"nevertheless, except you share"

161,4,"your tears, you are not worth their merriment,"
162,5, let the boy try along this bayonet-blade
163,5,"how cold steel is, and keen with hunger of blood;"
164,5,"blue with all malice, like a madman's flash;"
165,5,"and thinly drawn with famishing for flesh,"
166,5,"lend him to stroke these blind, blunt bullet-heads"
167,5,"which long to muzzle in the hearts of lads,"
168,5,"or give him cartridges of fine zinc teeth,"
169,5,"sharp with the sharpness of grief and death,"
170,5,"for his teeth seem for laughing round an apple,"
171,5,  there lurk no claws behind his fingers supple;
172,5,"  and god will grow no talons at his heels,"
173,5,"  nor antlers through the thickness of his curls,"
174,6,"under his helmet, up against his pack,"
175,6,"after so many days of work and waking,"
176,6,"sleep took him by the brow and laid him back,"
177,6,
178,6,"there, in the happy no-time of his sleeping,"
179,6,"death took him by the heart, there heaved a quaking"
180,6,"of the aborted life within him leaping,"
181,6,"then chest and sleepy arms once more fell slack,"
182,6,
183,6,"and soon the slow, stray blood came creeping"
184,6,"from the intruding lead, like ants on track,"
185,6,
186,6,whether his deeper sleep lie shaded by the shaking
187,6,"of great wings, and the thoughts that hung the stars,"
188,6,"high-pillowed on calm pillows of god's making,"
189,6,"above these clouds, these rains, these sleets of lead,"
190,6,"and these winds' scimitars,"
191,6,-or whether yet his thin and sodden head
192,6,"confuses more and more with the low mould,"
193,6,his hair being one with the grey grass
194,6,"of finished fields, and wire-scrags rusty-old,"
195,6,who knows? who hopes? who troubles? let it pass!
196,6,"he sleeps, he sleeps less tremulous, less cold,"
197,6,"than we who wake, and waking say alas!"
198,7,"one ever hangs where shelled roads part,"
199,7,"in this war he too lost a limb,"
200,7,but his disciples hide apart;
201,7,"and now the soldiers bear with him,"
202,7,
203,7,"near golgotha strolls many a priest,"
204,7,and in their faces there is pride
205,7,that they were flesh-marked by the beast
206,7,by whom the gentle christ's denied
207,7,
208,7,the scribes on all the people shove
209,7,"and bawl allegiance to the state,"
210,7,but they who love the greater love
211,7,lay down their life; they do not hate
212,8,"the beautiful, the fair, the elegant,"
213,8,"is that which pleases us, says kant,"
214,8,"without a thought of interest or advantage,"
215,8,
216,8,i used to watch men when they spoke of beauty
217,8,"and measure their enthusiasm, one"
218,8,"an old man, seeing a   setting sun,"
219,8,praised it   a certain sense of duty
220,8,"to the calm evening and his time of life,"
221,8,i know another man that never says a beauty
222,8,but of a horse;  
223,8,
224,8,"men seldom speak of beauty, beauty as such,"
225,8,"not even lovers think about it much,"
226,8,women of course consider it for hours
227,8,in mirrors;  
228,8,
229,8,a shrapnel ball -
230,8,just where the wet skin glistened when he swam -
231,8,"like a fully-opened sea-anemone,"
232,8,"we both said 'what a beauty! what a beauty, lad'"
233,8,i knew that in that flower he saw a hope
234,8,"of living on, and seeing again the roses of his home,"
235,8,"beauty is that which pleases and delights,"
236,8,"not bringing personal advantage - kant,"
237,8,but later on i heard
238,8,a canker worked into that crimson flower
239,8,and that he sank with it
240,8,"and laid it with the anemones off dover,"
241,9,"bugles sang, saddening the evening air,"
242,9,"and bugles answered, sorrowful to hear,"
243,9,
244,9,"voices of boys were by the river-side,"
245,9,"sleep mothered them; and left the twilight sad,"
246,9,"the shadow of the morrow weighed on men,"
247,9,
248,9,"voices of old despondency resigned,"
249,9,"bowed by the shadow of the morrow, slept,"
250,9,
251,9,  dying tone
252,9,"of receding voices that will not return,"
253,9,the wailing of the high far-travelling shells
254,9,and the deep cursing of the provoking  
255,9,
256,9,"the monstrous anger of our taciturn guns,"
257,9,"the majesty of the insults of their mouths,"
258,10,"his fingers wake, and flutter; up the bed,"
259,10,"his eyes come open with a pull of will,"
260,10,"helped by the yellow mayflowers by his head,"
261,10,"the blind-cord drawls across the window-sill,"
262,10,what a smooth floor the ward has! what a rug!
263,10,who is that talking somewhere out of sight?
264,10,"three flies creeping round the shiny jug,"
265,10,"'nurse! doctor!'-'yes; all right, all right,'"
266,10,
267,10,"but sudden evening muddles all the air,"
268,10,"there seems no time to want a drink of water,"
269,10,"nurse looks so far away, and here and there"
270,10,"music and roses burst through crimson slaughter,"
271,10,"he can't remember where he saw blue sky,"
272,10,"the trench is narrower, cold, he's cold; yet hot --"
273,10,"and there's no light to see the voices by,"
274,10,"there is no time to ask, he knows not what,"
275,11,"he sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,"
276,11,"and shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,"
277,11,"legless, sewn short at elbow, through the park"
278,11,"voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,"
279,11,"voices of play and pleasure after day,"
280,11,"till gathering sleep had mothered them from him,"
281,11,
282,11,about this time town used to swing so gay
283,11,"when glow-lamps budded in the light blue trees,"
284,11,"and girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,-"
285,11,"in the old times, before he threw away his knees,"
286,11,now he will never feel again how slim
287,11,"girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,"
288,11,"all of them touch him like some queer disease,"
289,11,
290,11,"there was an artist silly for his face,"
291,11,"for it was younger than his youth, last year,"
292,11,"now, he is old; his back will never brace;"
293,11,"he's lost his colour very far from here,"
294,11,"poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,"
295,11,and half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race
296,11,"and leap of purple spurted from his thigh,"
297,11,
298,11,"one time he liked a blood-smear down his leg,"
299,11,"after the matches, carried shoulder-high,"
300,11,"it was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,"
301,11,"he thought he'd better join, - he wonders why,"
302,11,"someone had said he'd look a god in kilts,"
303,11,"that's why; and maybe, too, to please his meg,"
304,11,"aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts"
305,11,"he asked to join, he didn't have to beg;"
306,11,"smiling they wrote his lie, aged nineteen years,"
307,11,
308,11,"germans he scarcely thought of; all their guilt,"
309,11,"and austria's, did not move him, and no fears"
310,11,"of fear came yet, he drought of jewelled hills"
311,11,for daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
312,11,and care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
313,11,"esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits,"
314,11,"and soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers,"
315,11,
316,11,"some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer goal,"
317,11,only a solemn man who brought him fruits
318,11,"thanked him; and then enquired about his soul,"
319,11,
320,11,"now, he will spend a few sick years in institutes,"
321,11,"and do what things the rules consider wise,"
322,11,"and take whatever pity they may dole,"
323,11,tonight he noticed how the women's eyes
324,11,"passed from him to the strong men that were whole,"
325,11,how cold and late it is! why don't they come
326,11,and put him into bed? why don't they come?
327,12,"bent double, like old beggars under sacks,"
328,12,"knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,"
329,12,"till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,"
330,12,"and towards our distant rest began to trudge,"
331,12,"men marched asleep, many had lost their boots,"
332,12,"but limped on, blood-shod, all went lame, all blind;"
333,12,drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
334,12,"of gas-shells dropping softly behind,"
335,12,
336,12,"gas! gas! quick, boys!--an ecstasy of fumbling"
337,12,"fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,"
338,12,but someone still was yelling out and stumbling
339,12,"and flound'ring like a man in fire or lime,--"
340,12,"dim through the misty panes and thick green light,"
341,12,"as under a green sea, i saw him drowning,"
342,12,in all my dreams before my helpless sight
343,12,"he plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning,"
344,12,
345,12,"if in some smothering dreams, you too could pace"
346,12,"behind the wagon that we flung him in,"
347,12,"and watch the white eyes writhing in his face,"
348,12,"his hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin,"
349,12,"if you could hear, at every jolt, the blood"
350,12,come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs
351,12,bitter as the cud
352,12,"of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,--"
353,12,"my friend, you would not tell with such high zest"
354,12,"to children ardent for some desperate glory,"
355,12,"the old lie, dulce et decorum est"
356,12,"pro patria mori,"
357,13,"hush, thrush! hush, missen-thrush, i listen,"
358,13,"i heard the flush of footsteps through the loose leaves,"
359,13,"and a low whistle by the water's brim,"
360,13,
361,13,"still! daffodil! nay, hail me not so gaily,-"
362,13,"your gay gold lily daunts me and deceives,"
363,13,"who follow gleams more golden and more slim,"
364,13,
365,13,"look, brook! o run and look, o run!"
366,13,"the vain reeds shook? - yet search till gray sea heaves,"
367,13,"and i will stray among these fields for him,"
368,13,
369,13,"gaze, daisy! stare through haze and glare,"
370,13,"and mark the hazardous stars all dawns and eves,"
371,13,"for my eye withers, and his star wanes dim,"
372,13,
373,13,2
374,13,
375,13,"close, rose, and droop, heliotrope,"
376,13,"and shudder, hope! the shattering winter blows,"
377,13,"drop, heliotrope, and close, rose,"
378,13,
379,13,"mourn, corn, and sigh, rye,"
380,13,"men garner you, but youth's head lies forlorn,"
381,13,"sigh, rye, and mourn, corn,"
382,13,
383,13,"brood, wood, and muse, yews,"
384,13,"the ways gods use we have not understood,"
385,13,"muse, yews, and brood, wood,"
386,14,i
387,14,"our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that knife us ,"
388,14,"wearied we keep awake because the night is silent ,"
389,14,"low drooping flares confuse our memory of the salient ,"
390,14,"worried by silence, sentries whisper, curious, nervous,"
391,14,"  but nothing happens,"
392,14,"watching, we hear the mad gusts tugging on the wire,"
393,14,"like twitching agonies of men among its brambles,"
394,14,"northward incessantly, the flickering gunnery rumbles,"
395,14,"far off, like a dull rumour of some other war,"
396,14,    what are we doing here?
397,14,"  the poignant misery of dawn begins to grow ,"
398,14,"  we only know war lasts, rain soaks, and clouds sag stormy,"
399,14,  dawn massing in the east her melancholy army
400,14,"  attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks of gray,"
401,14,"    but nothing happens,"
402,14,"  sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence,"
403,14,"  less deadly than the air that shudders black with snow,"
404,14,"  with sidelong flowing flakes that flock, pause and renew,"
405,14,"  we watch them wandering up and down the wind's nonchalance,"
406,14,"    but nothing happens,"
407,14,
408,14,ii
409,14,  pale flakes with lingering stealth come feeling for our faces--
410,14,"  we cringe in holes, back on forgotten dreams, and stare, snow-dazed,"
411,14,"  deep into grassier ditches, so we drowse, sun-dozed,"
412,14,"  littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird fusses,"
413,14,    is it that we are dying?
414,14,"  slowly our ghosts drag home, glimpsing the sunk fires glozed"
415,14,  with crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there;
416,14,"  for hours the innocent mice rejoice, the house is theirs;"
417,14,"  shutters and doors all closed, on us the doors are closed--"
418,14,"    we turn back to our dying,"
419,14,  since we believe not otherwise can kind fires burn;
420,14,"  now ever suns smile true on child, or field, or fruit,"
421,14,  for god's invincible spring our love is made afraid;
422,14,"  therefore, not loath, we lie out here; therefore were born,"
423,14,"    for love of god seems dying,"
424,14,"  to-night, his frost will fasten on this mud and us,"
425,14,"  shrivelling many hands and puckering foreheads crisp,"
426,14,"  the burying-party, picks and shovels in their shaking grasp,"
427,14,"  pause over half-known faces, all their eyes are ice,"
428,14,"    but nothing happens,"
429,15,leaves
430,15,"            murmuring by miriads in the shimmering trees,"
431,15,lives
432,15,"            wakening with wonder in the pyrenees,"
433,15,birds
434,15,"            cheerily chirping in the early day,"
435,15,bards
436,15,"            singing of summer, scything thro' the hay,"
437,15,bees
438,15,"            shaking the heavy dews from bloom and frond,"
439,15,boys
440,15,"            bursting the surface of the ebony pond,"
441,15,flashes
442,15,"            of swimmers carving thro' the sparkling cold,"
443,15,fleshes
444,15,"            gleaming with wetness to the morning gold,"
445,15,a mead
446,15,"            bordered about with warbling water brooks,"
447,15,a maid
448,15,"            laughing the love-laugh with me; proud of looks,"
449,15,the heat
450,15,"            throbbing between the upland and the peak,"
451,15,her heart
452,15,"            quivering with passion to my pressed cheek,"
453,15,braiding
454,15,"            of floating flames across the mountain brow,"
455,15,brooding
456,15,"            of stillness; and a sighing of the bough,"
457,15,stirs
458,15,            of leaflets in the gloom; soft petal-showers;
459,15,stars
460,15,"            expanding with the starr'd nocturnal flowers,"
461,16, move him into the sun--
462,16,"gently its touch awoke him once,"
463,16,"at home, whispering of fields unsown,"
464,16,"always it awoke him, even in france,"
465,16,"until this morning and this snow,"
466,16,if anything might rouse him now
467,16,"the kind old sun will know,"
468,16,think how it wakes the seeds--
469,16,"woke, once, the clays of a cold star,"
470,16,"  are limbs so dear-achieved, are sides"
471,16,"  full-nerved,--still warm,--too hard to stir?"
472,16,  was it for this the clay grew tall?
473,16,  --o what made fatuous sunbeams toil
474,16,  to break earth's sleep at all?
475,17,red lips are not so red
476,17,"as the stained stones kissed by the english dead,"
477,17,kindness of wooed and wooer
478,17,"seems shame to their love pure,"
479,17,"o love, your eyes lose lure"
480,17,when i behold eyes blinded in my stead!
481,17,
482,17,your slender attitude
483,17,"trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed,"
484,17,rolling and rolling there
485,17,where god seems not to care;
486,17,till the fierce love they bear
487,17,"cramps them in death's extreme decrepitude,"
488,17,
489,17,"your voice sings not so soft,-"
490,17,"though even as wind murmuring through raftered loft,-"
491,17,"your dear voice is not dear,"
492,17,"gentle, and evening clear,"
493,17,"as theirs whom none now hear,"
494,17,"now earth has stopped their piteous mouths that coughed,"
495,17,
496,17,"heart, you were never hot"
497,17,"nor large, nor full like hearts made great with shot;"
498,17,"and though your hand be pale,"
499,17,paler are all which trail
500,17,"your cross through flame and hail,"
501,17,"weep, you may weep, for you may touch them not,"
502,18,"ever again to breathe pure happiness,"
503,18,so happy that we gave away our toy?
504,18,"we smiled at nothings, needing no caress?"
505,18,have we not laughed too often since with joy?
506,18,have we not stolen too strange and sorrowful wrongs
507,18,"for her hands' pardoning? the sun may cleanse,"
508,18,"and time, and starlight, life will sing great songs,"
509,18,"and gods will show us pleasures more than men's,"

515,18,"boys' griefs are not so grievous as our yearning,"
516,18,"boys have no sadness sadder than our hope,"
517,19,has your soul sipped
518,19,of the sweetness of all sweets?
519,19,has it well supped
520,19,but yet hungers and sweats?
521,19,
522,19,i have been witness
523,19,"of a strange sweetness,"
524,19,all fancy surpassing
525,19,"past all supposing,"
526,19,
527,19,passing the rays
528,19,"of the rubies of morning,"
529,19,or the soft rise
530,19,of the moon; or the meaning
531,19,known to the rose
532,19,"of her mystery and mourning,"
533,19,
534,19,sweeter than nocturnes
535,19,of the wild nightingale
536,19,or than love's nectar
537,19,"after life's gall,"
538,19,
539,19,sweeter than odours
540,19,"of living leaves,"
541,19,sweeter than ardours
542,19,"of dying loves,"
543,19,
544,19,sweeter than death
545,19,and dreams hereafter
546,19,to one in dearth
547,19,"or life and its laughter,"
548,19,
549,19,or the proud wound
550,19,the victor wears
551,19,or the last end
552,19,"of all wars,"
553,19,
554,19,or the sweet murder
555,19,after long guard
556,19,unto the martyr
557,19,smiling at god;
558,19,
559,19,"to me was that smile,"
560,19,"faint as a wan, worn myth,"
561,19,"faint and exceeding small,"
562,19,"on a boy's murdered mouth,"
563,19,
564,19,though from his throat
565,19,the life-tide leaps
566,19,there was no threat
567,19,"on his lips,"
568,19,
569,19,but with the bitter blood
570,19,and the death-smell
571,19,all his life's sweetness bled
572,19,"into a smile,"
573,20,"budging the sluggard ripples of the somme,"
574,20,"a barge round old cérisy slowly slewed,"
575,20,"softly her engines down the current screwed,"
576,20,"and chuckled softly with contented hum,"
577,20,"till fairy tinklings struck their croonings dumb,"
578,20,the waters rumpling at the stern subdued;
579,20,the lock-gate took her bulging amplitude;
580,20,"gently from out the gurgling lock she swum,"
581,20,
582,20,one reading by that calm bank shaded eyes
583,20,"to watch her lessening westward quietly,"
584,20,"then, as she neared the bend, her funnel screamed,"
585,20,and that long lamentation made him wise
586,20,"how unto avalon, in agony,"
587,20,"kings passed in the dark barge, which merlin dreamed,"
588,21,i
589,21,
590,21,happy are men who yet before they are killed
591,21,"can let their veins run cold,"
592,21,whom no compassion fleers
593,21,or makes their feet
594,21,"sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers,"
595,21,"the front line withers,"
596,21,"but they are troops who fade, not flowers"
597,21,"for poets' tearful fooling,"
598,21,"men, gaps for filling"
599,21,losses who might have fought
600,21,"longer; but no one bothers,"
601,21,

603,21,
604,21,and some cease feeling
605,21,"even themselves or for themselves,"
606,21,dullness best solves
607,21,"the tease and doubt of shelling,"
608,21,and chance's strange arithmetic
609,21,"comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling,"
610,21,"they keep no check on armies' decimation,"
611,21,
612,21,iii
613,21,
614,21,"happy are these who lose imagination,"
615,21,"they have enough to carry with ammunition,"
616,21,"their spirit drags no pack,"
617,21,"their old wounds save with cold can not more ache,"
618,21,"having seen all things red,"
619,21,their eyes are rid
620,21,"of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever,"
621,21,"and terror's first constriction over,"
622,21,"their hearts remain small drawn,"
623,21,their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
624,21,"now long since ironed,"
625,21,"can laugh among the dying, unconcerned,"
626,21,
627,21,iv
628,21,
629,21,"happy the soldier home, with not a notion"
630,21,"how somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,"
631,21,"and many sighs are drained,"
632,21,"happy the lad whose mind was never trained,"
633,21,"his days are worth forgetting more than not,"
634,21,he sings along the march
635,21,"which we march taciturn, because of dusk,"
636,21,"the long, forlorn, relentless trend"
637,21,"from larger day to huger night,"
638,21,
639,21,v
640,21,
641,21,"we wise, who with a thought besmirch"
642,21,"blood over all our soul,"
643,21,how should we see our task
644,21,but through his blunt and lashless eyes?
645,21,"alive, he is not vital overmuch;"
646,21,"dying, not mortal overmuch;"
647,21,"nor sad, nor proud,"
648,21,"nor curious at all,"
649,21,he cannot tell
650,21,"old men's placidity from his,"
651,21,
652,21,vi
653,21,
654,21,"but cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,"
655,21,"that they should be as stones,"
656,21,"wretched are they, and mean"
657,21,"with paucity that never was simplicity,"
658,21,by choice they made themselves immune
659,21,to pity and whatever mourns in man
660,21,before the last sea and the hapless stars;
661,21,whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
662,21,whatever shares
663,21,"the eternal reciprocity of tears,"
664,22,"'you! what d'you mean by this?' i rapped,"
665,22,'you dare come on parade like this?'
666,22,"'please, sir, it's-' ''old yer mouth,' the sergeant snapped,"
667,22,"'i takes 'is name, sir?'-'please, and then dismiss,'"
668,22,
669,22,"some days 'confined to camp' he got,"
670,22,"for being 'dirty on parade',"
671,22,"he told me, afterwards, the damnèd spot"
672,22,"was blood, his own, 'well, blood is dirt,' i said,"
673,22,
674,22,"'blood's dirt,' he laughed, looking away,"
675,22,far off to where his wound had bled
676,22,"and almost merged for ever into clay,"
677,22,"'the world is washing out its stains,' he said,"
678,22,"'it doesn't like our cheeks so red,"
679,22,"young blood's its great objection,"
680,22,"but when we're duly white-washed, being dead,"
681,22,"the race will bear field-marshal god's inspection,'"
682,23,so the church christ was hit and buried
683,23,"under its rubbish and its rubble,"
684,23,"in cellars, packed-up saints long serried,"
685,23,"well out of hearing of our trouble,"
686,23,
687,23,one virgin still immaculate
688,23,"smiles on for war to flatter her,"
689,23,"she's halo'd with an old tin hat,"
690,23,"but a piece of hell will batter her,"
691,24,between the brown hands of a server-lad
692,24,"the silver cross was offered to be kissed,"
693,24,"the men came up, lugubrious, but not sad,"
694,24,"and knelt reluctantly, half-prejudiced,"
695,24,"and kissing, kissed the emblem of a creed,"
696,24,"then mourning women knelt; meek mouths they had,"
697,24,"and kissed the body of the christ indeed,"
698,24,"young children came, with eager lips and glad,"
699,24,"these kissed a silver doll, immensely bright,"
700,24,"then i, too, knelt before that acolyte,"
701,24,"above the crucifix i bent my head,"
702,24,"the christ was thin, and cold, and very dead,"
703,24,"and yet i bowed, yea, kissed - my lips did cling,"
704,24,"i kissed the warm live hand that held the thing,"
705,25,who are these? why sit they here in twilight?
706,25,"wherefore rock they, purgatorial shadows,"
707,25,"drooping tongues from jays that slob their relish,"
708,25,baring teeth that leer like skulls' teeth wicked?
709,25,"stroke on stroke of pain,- but what slow panic,"
710,25,gouged these chasms round their fretted sockets?
711,25,ever from their hair and through their hands' palms
712,25,"misery swelters, surely we have perished"
713,25,"sleeping, and walk hell; but who these hellish?"
714,25,
715,25,"-these are men whose minds the dead have ravished,"
716,25,"memory fingers in their hair of murders,"
717,25,"multitudinous murders they once witnessed,"
718,25,"wading sloughs of flesh these helpless wander,"
719,25,"treading blood from lungs that had loved laughter,"
720,25,"always they must see these things and hear them,"
721,25,"batter of guns and shatter of flying muscles,"
722,25,"carnage incomparable, and human squander"
723,25,"rucked too thick for these men's extrication,"
724,25,
725,25,therefore still their eyeballs shrink tormented
726,25,"back into their brains, because on their sense"
727,25,sunlight seems a blood-smear; night comes blood-black;
728,25,"dawn breaks open like a wound that bleeds afresh,"
729,25,"-thus their heads wear this hilarious, hideous,"
730,25,"awful falseness of set-smiling corpses,"
731,25,-thus their hands are plucking at each other;
732,25,picking at the rope-knouts of their scourging;
733,25,"snatching after us who smote them, brother,"
734,25,"pawing us who dealt them war and madness,"
735,26,"there was a whispering in my hearth,"
736,26,"a sigh of the coal,"
737,26,grown wistful of a former earth
738,26,"it might recall,"
739,26,
740,26,i listened for a tale of leaves
741,26,"and smothered ferns,"
742,26,"frond-forests; and the low, sly lives"
743,26,"before the fawns,"
744,26,
745,26,my fire might show steam-phantoms simmer
746,26,"from time's old cauldron,"
747,26,"before the birds made nests in summer,"
748,26,"or men had children,"
749,26,
750,26,"but the coals were murmuring of their mine,"
751,26,and moans down there
752,26,"of boys that slept wry sleep, and men"
753,26,"writhing for air,"
754,26,
755,26,"and i saw white bones in the cinder-shard,"
756,26,"bones without number,"
757,26,"for many hearts with coal are charred,"
758,26,"and few remember,"
759,26,
760,26,i thought of all that worked dark pits
761,26,"of war, and died"
762,26,digging the rock where death reputes
763,26,"peace lies indeed,"
764,26,
765,26,comforted years will sit soft-chaired
766,26,in rooms of amber;
767,26,"the years will stretch their hands, well-cheered"
768,26,"by our lifes' ember,"
769,26,
770,26,the centuries will burn rich loads
771,26,"with which we groaned,"
772,26,"whose warmth shall lull their dreaming lids,"
773,26,"while songs are crooned,"
774,26,but they will not dream of us poor lads
775,26,"left in the ground,"
776,27,i have been urged by earnest violins
777,27,and drunk their mellow sorrows to the slake
778,27,"of all my sorrows and my thirsting sins,"
779,27,"my heart has beaten for a brave drum's sake,"
780,27,"huge chords have wrought me mighty, i have hurled"
781,27,"thuds of gods' thunder, and with old winds pondered"
782,27,"over the curse of this chaotic world,-"
783,27,"with low lost winds that maundered as they wandered,"
784,27,
785,27,i have been gay with trivial fifes that laugh;
786,27,and songs more sweet than possible things are sweet;
787,27,"and gongs, and oboes, yet i guessed not half"
788,27,"life's symphony till i had made hearts beat,"
789,27,"and touched love's body into trembling cries,"
790,27,"and blown my love's lips into laughs and sighs,"
791,28,"my shy hand shades a hermitage apart, -"
792,28,"      o large enough for thee, and thy brief hours,"
793,28,"life there is sweeter held than in god's heart,"
794,28,"      stiller than in the heavens of hollow flowers,"
795,28,
796,28,"the wine is gladder there than in gold bowls,"
797,28,"      and time shall not drain thence, nor trouble spill,"
798,28,"sources between my fingers feed all souls,"
799,28,"      where thou mayest cool thy lips, and draw thy fill,"
800,28,
801,28,"five cushions hath my hand, for reveries;"
802,28,      and one deep pillow for thy brow's fatigues;
803,28,"languor of june all winterlong, and ease"
804,28,"      for ever from the vain untravelled leagues,"
805,28,
806,28,"thither your years may gather in from storm,"
807,28,"and love, that sleepeth there, will keep thee warm,"
808,29,"though unseen poets, many and many a time,"
809,29,"have answered me as if they knew my woe,"
810,29,and it might seem have fashioned so their rime
811,29,to be my own soul's cry; easing the flow
812,29,"of my dumb tears with language sweet as sobs,"
813,29,yet are there days when all these hoards of thought
814,29,"hold nothing for me, not one verse that throbs"
815,29,"throbs with my heart, or as my brain is fraught,"
816,29,"'tis then i voice mine own weird reveries,"
817,29,"low croonings of a motherless child, in gloom"
818,29,"singing his frightened self to sleep, are these,"
819,29,"one night, if thou shouldst lie in this sick room,"
820,29,"dreading the dark thou darest not illume,"
821,29,"listen; my voice may haply lend thee ease,"
822,30,red lips are not so red
823,30,"  as the stained stones kissed by the english dead,"
824,30,kindness of wooed and wooer
825,30,"seems shame to their love pure,"
826,30,"o love, your eyes lose lure"
827,30,  when i behold eyes blinded in my stead!
828,30,
829,30,your slender attitude
830,30,"  trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed,"
831,30,rolling and rolling there
832,30,where god seems not to care;
833,30,till the fierce love they bear
834,30,"  cramps them in death's extreme decrepitude,"
835,30,
836,30,"your voice sings not so soft, --"
837,30,"  though even as wind murmuring through raftered loft, --"
838,30,"your dear voice is not dear,"
839,30,"gentle, and evening clear,"
840,30,as theirs whom none now hear
841,30,"  now earth has stopped their piteous mouths that coughed,"
842,30,
843,30,"heart, you were never hot,"
844,30,"  nor large, nor full like hearts made great with shot;"

846,30,paler are all which trail
847,30,"your cross through flame and hail,"
848,30,"  weep, you may weep, for you may touch them not,"
849,31," i will to the king,"
850,31,"   and offer him consolation in his trouble,"
851,31,"   for that man there has set his teeth to die,"
852,31,"   and being one that hates obedience,"
853,31,"   discipline, and orderliness of life,"

856,31,
857,31,"patting goodbye, doubtless they told the lad"
858,31,he'd always show the hun a brave man's face;

860,31,"was proud to see him going, aye, and glad,"
861,31,perhaps his mother whimpered how she'd fret
862,31,"until he got a nice, safe wound to nurse,"
863,31,"sisters would wish girls too could shoot, charge, curse, , , ,"
864,31,"brothers -- would send his favourite cigarette,"
865,31,"each week, month after month, they wrote the same,"
866,31,"thinking him sheltered in some y,m, hut,"
867,31,where once an hour a bullet missed its aim
868,31,"and misses teased the hunger of his brain,"
869,31,"his eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand"
870,31,"reckless with ague,  courage leaked, as sand"
871,31,"from the best sandbags after years of rain,"
872,31,"but never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock,"
873,31,"untrapped the wretch,  and death seemed still withheld"
874,31,"for torture of lying machinally shelled,"
875,31,"at the pleasure of this world's powers who'd run amok,"
876,31,
877,31,"he'd seen men shoot their hands, on night patrol,"
878,31,"their people never knew,  yet they were vile,"
879,31,"death sooner than dishonour, that's the style!"
880,31,"so father said,"
881,31,
882,31,"                one dawn, our wire patrol"
883,31,"carried him,  this time, death had not missed,"
884,31,"we could do nothing, but wipe his bleeding cough,"
885,31,"could it be accident? --  rifles go off , , ,"
886,31,"not sniped? no, later they found the english ball,"
887,31,
888,31,"it was the reasoned crisis of his soul,"
889,31,against the fires that would not burn him whole
890,31,but kept him for death's perjury and scoff
891,31,"and life's half-promising, and both their riling,"
892,31,
893,31,"with him they buried the muzzle his teeth had kissed,"
894,31,"and truthfully wrote the mother tim died smiling,"
895,32,schoolmistress
896,32,"having, with bold horatius, stamped her feet"
897,32,and waved a final swashing arabesque
898,32,"o'er the brave days of old, she ceased to bleat,"
899,32,"slapped her macaulay back upon the desk,"
900,32,"resuned her calm gaze and her lofty seat,"
901,32,
902,32,"there, while she heard the classic lines repeat,"
903,32,once more the teacher's face clenched stern;
904,32,"for through the window, looking on the street,"
905,32,"three soldiers hailed her, she made no return,"
906,32,"one was called 'orace whom she would not greet,"
907,33,"i am the ghost of shadwell stair,"
908,33,"      along the wharves by the water-house,"
909,33,"      and through the cavernous slaughter-house,"
910,33,"i am the shadow that walks there,"
911,33,
912,33,"yet i have flesh both firm and cool,"
913,33,      and eyes tumultuous as the gems
914,33,      of moons and lamps in the full thames
915,33,"when dusk sails wavering down the pool,"
916,33,
917,33,shuddering the purple street-arc burns
918,33,      where i watch always; from the banks
919,33,      dolorously the shipping clanks
920,33,"and after me a strange tide turns,"
921,33,
922,33,i walk till the stars of london wane
923,33,"      and dawn creeps up the shadwell stair,"
924,33,      but when the crowing syrens blare
925,33,"i with another ghost am lain,"
926,34,"in twos and threes, they have not far to roam,"
927,34,"crowds that thread eastward, gay of eyes;"
928,34,"those seek no further than their quiet home,"
929,34,"wives, walking westward, slow and wise,"
930,34,
931,34,"neither should i go fooling over clouds,"
932,34,"following gleams unsafe, untrue,"
933,34,"and tiring after beauty through star-crowds,"
934,34,dared i go side by side with you;
935,34,
936,34,"or be you in the gutter where you stand,"
937,34,"pale rain-flawed phantom of the place,"
938,34,"with news of all the nations in your hand,"
939,34,"and all their sorrows in your face,"
940,35,"head to limp head, the sunk-eyed wounded scanned"
941,35,yesterday's mail; the casualties typed small
942,35,"and large vast booty from our latest haul,"
943,35,"also, they read of cheap homes, not yet planned;"
944,35,"for, said the paper, when this war is done"
945,35,"the men's first instinct will be making homes,"
946,35,"meanwhile their foremost need is aerodromes,"
947,35,"it being certain war has just begun,"
948,35,"peace would do wrong to our undying dead, --"
949,35,the sons we offered might regret they died
950,35,"if we got nothing lasting in their stead,"
951,35,"we must be solidly indemnified,"
952,35,"though all be worthy victory which all bought,"
953,35,we rulers sitting in this ancient spot
954,35,would wrong our very selves if we forgot
955,35,"the greatest glory will be theirs who fought,"
956,35,"who kept this nation in integrity,"
957,35,nation? --  the half-limbed readers did not chafe
958,35,but smiled at one another curiously
959,35,"like secret men who know their secret safe,"
960,35,"this is the thing they know and never speak,"
961,35,that england one by one had fled to france
962,35,"not many elsewhere now save under france,"
963,35,"pictures of these broad smiles appear each week,"
964,35,and people in whose voice real feeling rings
965,35,"say,  how they smile!  they're happy now, poor things,"
966,36,i dreamed kind jesus fouled the big-gun gears;
967,36,and caused a permanent stoppage in all bolts;
968,36,and buckled with a smile mausers and colts;
969,36,"and rusted every bayonet with his tears,"
970,36,
971,36,"and there were no more bombs, of ours or theirs,"
972,36,"not even an old flint-lock, not even a pikel,"
973,36,"but god was vexed, and gave all power to michael;"
974,36,"and when i woke he'd seen to our repairs,"
975,37,sing me at morn but only with your laugh;
976,37,even as spring that laugheth into leaf;
977,37,"even as love that laugheth after life,"
978,37,
979,37,"sing me but only with your speech all day,"
980,37,as voluble leaflets do; let viols die;
981,37,the least word of your lips is melody!
982,37,
983,37,sing me at eve but only your sigh!
984,37,"like lifting seas it solaceth; breathe so,"
985,37,"slowly and low, the sense that no songs say,"
986,37,
987,37,sing me at midnight with your murmurous heart!
988,37,let youth's immortal-moaning chord be heard
989,37,"throbbing through you, and sobbing, unsubdued,"
990,38,if ever i had dreamed of my dead name
991,38,"high in the heart of london, unsurpassed"
992,38,"by time for ever, and the fugitive, fame,"
993,38,"there seeking a long sanctuary at last, -"
994,38,
995,38,"or if i onetime hoped to hide its shame,"
996,38,"- shame of success, and sorrow of defeats, -"
997,38,"under those holy cypresses, the same"
998,38,"that shade always the quiet place of keats,"
999,38,
1000,38,now rather thank i god there is no risk
1001,38,"of gravers scoring it with florid screed,"
1002,38,"let my inscription be this soldier's disc,"
1003,38,"wear it, sweet friend, inscribe no date nor deed,"
1004,38,"but may thy heart-beat kiss it, night and day,"
1005,38,"until the name grow blurred and fade away,"
1006,39,"be slowly lifted up, thou long black arm,"
1007,39,"great gun towering towards heaven, about to curse;"
1008,39,"sway steep against them, and for years rehearse"
1009,39,huge imprecations like a blasting charm!
1010,39,"reach at that arrogance which needs thy harm,"
1011,39,"and beat it down before its sins grow worse,"
1012,39,"spend our resentment, cannon, -- yea, disburse"
1013,39,"our gold in shapes of flame, our breaths in storm,"
1014,39,
1015,39,"yet, for men's sakes whom thy vast malison"
1016,39,"must wither innocent of enmity,"
1017,39,"be not withdrawn, dark arm, thy spoilure done,"
1018,39,"safe to the bosom of our prosperity,"
1019,39,"but when thy spell be cast complete and whole,"
1020,39,"may god curse thee, and cut thee from our soul!"
1021,40,"a vague pearl, a wan pearl"
1022,40,you showed me once; i peered through far-gone winters
1023,40,"until my mind was fog-bound in that gem,"
1024,40,
1025,40,"blue diamonds, cold diamonds"
1026,40,"you shook before me, so that out of them"
1027,40,"glittered and glowed vast diamond dawns of spring,"
1028,40,
1029,40,"tiger-eyed rubies, wrathful rubies"
1030,40,"you rolled, i watched their hot hearts fling"
1031,40,"flames from each glaring summer of my life,"
1032,40,
1033,40,"quiet amber, mellow amber"
1034,40,you lifted; and behold the whole air rife
1035,40,"with evening, and the auburn autumn cloud,"
1036,40,
1037,40,"but pale skin, your pearl skin"
1038,40,"show this to me, and i shall have surprise"
1039,40,"of every snow-lit dawn before it break,"
1040,40,
1041,40,"but clear eyes, your fresh eyes"
1042,40,"open; that i may laugh, and lightly take"
1043,40,"all air of early april in one hour,"
1044,40,
1045,40,"but brown curls, o shadow me with curls,"
1046,40,"full of september mist, half-gleam, half-glower,"
1047,40,"and i shall roam warm nights in lands far south,"
1048,41,"halted against the shade of a last hill,"
1049,41,"they fed, and lying easy, were at ease"
1050,41,"and, finding comfortable chests and knees,"
1051,41,"carelessly slept, but many there stood still"
1052,41,"to face the stark blank sky beyond the ridge,"
1053,41,"knowing their feet had come to the end of the world,"
1054,41,
1055,41,"marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled"
1056,41,"by the may breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,"
1057,41,for though the summer oozed into their veins
1058,41,"like an injected drug for their bodies' pains,"
1059,41,"sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,"
1060,41,"fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass,"
1061,41,
1062,41,"hour after hour they ponder the warm field, -"
1063,41,"and the far valley behind, where the buttercup"
1064,41,"had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,"
1065,41,where even the little brambles would not yield
1066,41,"but clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands,"
1067,41,"[          ] they breathe like trees unstirred,"
1068,41,
1069,41,till like a cold gust thrills the little word
1070,41,at which each body and its soul begird
1071,41,"and tighten them for battle, no alarms"
1072,41,"of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste, -"
1073,41,only a lift and flare of eyes that faced
1074,41,"the sun, like a friend with whom their love is done,"
1075,41,"o larger shone that smile against the sun, -"
1076,41,"mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned,"
1077,41,
1078,41,"so, soon they topped the hill, and raced together"
1079,41,over an open stretch of herb and heather
1080,41,"exposed, and instantly the whole sky burned"
1081,41,with fury against them; earth set sudden cups
1082,41,in thousands for their blood; and the green slope
1083,41,"chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space,"
1084,41,
1085,41,of them who running on that last high place
1086,41,"leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up"
1087,41,"on the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,"
1088,41,"or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,"
1089,41,"some say god caught them even before they fell,"
1090,41,
1091,41,but what say such as from existence' brink
1092,41,"ventured but drave too swift to sink,"
1093,41,"the few who rushed in the body to enter hell,"
1094,41,and there out-fiending all its fiends and flames
1095,41,"with superhuman inhumanities,"
1096,41,"long-famous glories, immemorial shames -"
1097,41,"and crawling slowly back, have by degrees"
1098,41,regained cool peaceful air in wonder -
1099,41,why speak not they of comrades that went under?
1100,42,his face was charged with beauty as a cloud
1101,42,"      with glimmering lightning, when it shadowed me"
1102,42,"      i shook, and was uneasy as a tree"
1103,42,"that draws the brilliant danger, tremulous, bowed,"
1104,42,
1105,42,"so must i tempt that face to loose its lightning,"
1106,42,"      great gods, whose beauty is death, will laugh above,"
1107,42,"      who made his beauty lovelier than love,"
1108,42,"i shall be bright with their unearthly brightening,"
1109,42,
1110,42,and happier were it if my sap consume;
1111,42,glorious will shine the opening of my heart;
1112,42,the land shall freshen that was under gloom;
1113,42,"what matter if all men cry aloud and start,"
1114,42,"and women hide bleak faces in their shawl,"
1115,42,at those hilarious thunders of my fall?
1116,43,it seemed that out of the battle i escaped
1117,43,"down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped"
1118,43,"through granites which titanic wars had groined,"
1119,43,"yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,"
1120,43,"too fast in thought or death to be bestirred,"
1121,43,"then, as i probed them, one sprang up, and stared"
1122,43,"with piteous recognition in fixed eyes,"
1123,43,"lifting distressful hands as if to bless,"
1124,43,"and by his smile, i knew that sullen hall;"
1125,43,"and by his dead smile i knew we stood in hell,"
1126,43, with a thousand fears that vision's face was grained;
1127,43," yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,"
1128,43," and no guns thumped, or down the fluies made moan,"
1129,43," strange, friend, i said, here is no cause to mourn,"
1130,43," none, said the other, save the undone years,"
1131,43," the hopelessness, whatever hope is yours,"
1132,43, was my life also; i went hunting wild
1133,43," after the wildest beauty in the world,"
1134,43," which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,"
1135,43," but mocks the steady running of the hour,"
1136,43," and if it grieves, grieves richlier than here,"
1137,43," for by my glee might many men have laughed,"
1138,43," and of my weeping something has been left,"
1139,43," which must die now, i mean the truth untold,"
1140,43," the pity of war, the pity war distilled,"
1141,43," now men will go content with what we spoiled,"
1142,43," or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled,"
1143,43," they will be swift with swiftness of the tigress,"
1144,43," none will break ranks, though nations trek from progress,"
1145,43," courage was mine, and i had mystery;"
1146,43," wisdom was mine, and i had mastery;"
1147,43, to miss the march of this retreating world
1148,43," into vain citadels that are not walled,"
1149,43," then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels"
1150,43," i would go up and wash them from sweet wells,"
1151,43," even with truths that lie too deep for taint,"
1152,43, i would have poured my spirit without stint
1153,43," but not through wounds; not on the cess of war,"
1154,43," foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were,"
1155,43," i am the enemy you killed, my friend,"
1156,43, i knew you in this dark; for so you frowned
1157,43," yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed,"
1158,43," i parried; but my hands were loath and cold,"
1159,43," let us sleep now ,"
1160,44,"a dismal fog-hoarse siren howls at dawn,"
1161,44,"i watch the man it calls for, pushed and drawn"
1162,44,"backwards and forwards, helpless as a pawn,"
1163,44,"but i'm lazy, and his work's crazy,"
1164,44,
1165,44,"quick treble bells begin at nine o'clock,"
1166,44,"scuttling the schoolboy pulling up his sock,"
1167,44,"scaring the late girl in the inky frock,"
1168,44,"i must be crazy; i learn from the daisy,"
1169,44,
1170,44,"stern bells annoy the rooks and doves at ten,"
1171,44,"i watch the verger close the doors, and when"
1172,44,"i hear the organ moan the first amen,"
1173,44,"sing my religion's-same as pigeons',"
1174,44,
1175,44,"a blatant bugle tears my afternoons,"
1176,44,"out clump the clumsy tommies by platoons,"
1177,44,"trying to keep in step with rag-time tunes,"
1178,44,"but i sit still; i've done my drill,"
1179,44,
1180,44,"gongs hum and buzz like saucepan-lids at dusk,"
1181,44,i see a food-hog whet his gold-filled tusk
1182,44,"to eat less bread, and more luxurious rusk,"
1183,44,
1184,44,then sometimes late at night my window bumps
1185,44,"from gunnery-practice, till my small heart thumps"
1186,44,"and listens for the shell-shrieks and the crumps,"
1187,44,"but that's not all,"
1188,44,
1189,44,for leaning out last midnight on my sill
1190,44,"i heard the sighs of men, that have no skill"
1191,44,"to speak of their distress, no, nor the will!"
1192,44,"a voice i know, and this time i must go,"
1193,45,i mind as 'ow the night afore that show
1194,45,"us five got talking, -- we was in the know,"
1195,45,"over the top to-morrer; boys, we're for it,"
1196,45,"first wave we are, first ruddy wave; that's tore it,"
1197,45,"ah well, says jimmy, -- an' 'e's seen some scrappin' --"
1198,45,there ain't more nor five things as can 'appen;
1199,45,ye get knocked out; else wounded -- bad or cushy;
1200,45,"scuppered; or nowt except yer feeling mushy,"
1201,45,
1202,45,"one of us got the knock-out, blown to chops,"
1203,45,"t'other was hurt, like, losin' both 'is props,"
1204,45,"an' one, to use the word of 'ypocrites,"
1205,45,"'ad the misfortoon to be took by fritz,"
1206,45,"now me, i wasn't scratched, praise god almighty"
1207,45,"though next time please i'll thank 'im for a blighty,"
1208,45,"but poor young jim, 'e's livin' an' 'e's not;"
1209,45,"'e reckoned 'e'd five chances, an' 'e's 'ad;"
1210,45,"'e's wounded, killed, and pris'ner, all the lot --"
1211,45,"the ruddy lot all rolled in one, jim's mad,"
1212,46,"he dropped, - more sullenly than wearily,"
1213,46,"lay stupid like a cod, heavy like meat,"
1214,46,and none of us could kick him to his feet;
1215,46,"- just blinked at my revolver, blearily;"
1216,46,"- didn't appear to know a war was on,"
1217,46,"or see the blasted trench at which he stared,"
1218,46,"'i'll do 'em in,' he whined, 'if this hand's spared,"
1219,46,"i'll murder them, i will,'"
1220,46,
1221,46,"a low voice said,"
1222,46,"'it's blighty, p'raps, he sees; his pluck's all gone,"
1223,46,"dreaming of all the valiant, that aren't dead,"
1224,46,"bold uncles, smiling ministerially;"
1225,46,"maybe his brave young wife, getting her fun"
1226,46,"in some new home, improved materially,"
1227,46,"it's not these stiffs have crazed him; nor the hun,'"
1228,46,
1229,46,"we sent him down at last, out of the way,"
1230,46,"unwounded; - stout lad, too, before that strafe,"
1231,46,"malingering? stretcher-bearers winked, 'not half!'"
1232,46,
1233,46,"next day i heard the doc,'s well-whiskied laugh,"
1234,46,"'that scum you sent last night soon died, hooray!'"
1235,47,"after the blast of lightning from the east,"
1236,47,"the flourish of loud clouds, the chariot throne,"
1237,47,after the drums of time have rolled and ceased
1238,47,"and from the bronze west long retreat is blown,"
1239,47,
1240,47,shall life renew these bodies? of a truth
1241,47,"all death will he annul, all tears assuage?"
1242,47,or fill these void veins full again with youth
1243,47,and wash with an immortal water age?
1244,47,
1245,47,"when i do ask white age, he saith not so, --"
1246,47,"my head hangs weighed with snow,"
1247,47,and when i hearken to the earth she saith
1248,47,"my fiery heart sinks aching,  it is death,"
1249,47,mine ancient scars shall not be glorified
1250,47,"nor my titanic tears the seas be dried,"
1251,48,"she sleeps on soft, last breaths; but no ghost looms"
1252,48,"out of the stillness of her palace wall,"
1253,48,"her wall of boys on boys and dooms on dooms,"
1254,48,
1255,48,"she dreams of golden gardens and sweet glooms,"
1256,48,not marvelling why her roses never fall
1257,48,"nor what red mouths were torn to make their blooms,"
1258,48,
1259,48,"the shades keep down which well might roam her hall,"
1260,48,quiet their blood lies in her crimson rooms
1261,48,"and she is not afraid of their footfall,"
1262,48,
1263,48,"they move not from her tapestries, their pall,"
1264,48,"nor pace her terraces, their hecatombs,"
1265,48,"lest aught she be disturbed, or grieved at all,"
1266,49,"'oh! jesus christ! i'm hit,' he said; and died,"
1267,49,"whether he vainly cursed or prayed indeed,"
1268,49,"the bullets chirped-in vain, vain, vain!"
1269,49,"machine-guns chuckled,-tut-tut! tut-tut!"
1270,49,"and the big gun guffawed,"
1271,49,
1272,49,"another sighed,-'o mother, -mother, - dad!'"
1273,49,"then smiled at nothing, childlike, being dead,"
1274,49,and the lofty shrapnel-cloud
1275,49,"leisurely gestured,-fool!"
1276,49,"and the splinters spat, and tittered,"
1277,49,
1278,49,"'my love!' one moaned, love-languid seemed his mood,"
1279,49,"till slowly lowered, his whole faced kissed the mud,"
1280,49,and the bayonets' long teeth grinned;
1281,49,rabbles of shells hooted and groaned;
1282,49,"and the gas hissed,"
1283,50,"with b,e,f, jun 10, dear wife,"
1284,50,"oh blast this pencil, 'ere, bill, lend's a knife,"
1285,50,"i'm in the pink at present, dear,"

1296,50,"we're out in the rest now, never fear,"
1297,50,"vrach! by crumbs, but that was near,"

1308,51,
1309,51,"out there, we've walked quite friendly up to death,-"
1310,51,"sat down and eaten with him, cool and bland,-"
1311,51,"pardoned his spilling mess-tins in our hand,"
1312,51,"we've sniffed the green thick odour of his breath,-"
1313,51,"our eyes wept, but our courage didn't writhe,"
1314,51,he's spat at us with bullets and he's coughed
1315,51,"shrapnel, we chorussed when he sang aloft,"
1316,51,"we whistled while he shaved us with his scythe,"
1317,51,
1318,51,"oh, death was never enemy of ours!"
1319,51,"we laughed at him, we leagued with him, old chum,"
1320,51,"no soldier's paid to kick against his powers,"
1321,51,"we laughed, -knowing that better men would come,"
1322,51,"and greater wars, when each proud fighter brags"
1323,51,"he wars on death, for lives; not men, for flags,"
1324,52,"so abram rose, and clave the wood, and went,"
1325,52,"and took the fire with him, and a knife,"
1326,52,"and as they sojourned both of them together,"
1327,52,"isaac the first-born spake and said, my father,"
1328,52,"behold the preparations, fire and iron,"
1329,52,but where the lamb for this burnt-offering?
1330,52,"then abram bound the youth with belts and straps,"
1331,52,"and builded parapets and trenches there,"
1332,52,"and stretchèd forth the knife to slay his son,"
1333,52,"when lo! an angel called him out of heaven,"
1334,52,"saying, lay not thy hand upon the lad,"
1335,52,"neither do anything to him, thy son,"
1336,52,"behold! caught in a thicket by its horns,"
1337,52,"a ram, offer the ram of pride instead,"
1338,52,
1339,52,"but the old man would not so, but slew his son,"
1340,52,"and half the seed of europe, one by one,"
1341,53,"the roads also have their wistful rest,"
1342,53,"when the weathercocks perch still and roost,"
1343,53,and the looks of men turn kind to clocks
1344,53,"and the trams go empty to their drome,"
1345,53,"the streets also dream their dream,"
1346,53,
1347,53,the old houses muse of the old days
1348,53,"and their fond trees leaning on them doze,"
1349,53,on their steps chatter and clatter stops
1350,53,for the cries of other times hold men
1351,53,"and they hear the unknown moan,"
1352,53,
1353,53,they remember alien ardours and far futures
1354,53,"and the smiles not seen in happy features,"
1355,53,their begetters call them from the gutters;
1356,53,"in the gardens unborn child-souls wail,"
1357,53,"and the dead scribble on walls,"
1358,53,
1359,53,"though their own child cry for them in tears,"
1360,53,"women weep but hear no sound upstairs,"
1361,53,they believe in love they had not lived
1362,53,and passion past the reach of stairs
1363,53,"to the world's towers or stars,"
1364,54,"down the close, darkening lanes they sang their way"
1365,54,"to the siding-shed,"
1366,54,"and lined the train with faces grimly gay,"
1367,54,
1368,54,their breasts were stuck all white with wreath and spray
1369,54,"as men's are, dead,"
1370,54,
1371,54,"dull porters watched them, and a casual tramp"
1372,54,"stood staring hard,"
1373,54,"sorry to miss them from the upland camp,"
1374,54,"then, unmoved, signals nodded, and a lamp"
1375,54,"winked to the guard,"
1376,54,
1377,54,"so secretly, like wrongs hushed-up, they went,"
1378,54,"they were not ours,"
1379,54,"we never heard to which front these were sent,"
1380,54,
1381,54,nor there if they yet mock what women meant
1382,54,"who gave them flowers,"
1383,54,
1384,54,shall they return to beatings of great bells
1385,54,in wild trainloads?
1386,54,"a few, a few, too few for drums and yells,"
1387,54,"may creep back, silent, to still village wells"
1388,54,"up half-known roads,"
1389,55,"we'd found an old boche dug-out, and he knew,"
1390,55,"and gave us hell, for shell on frantic shell"
1391,55,"hammered on top, but never quite burst through,"
1392,55,"rain, guttering down in waterfalls of slime,"
1393,55,"kept slush waist-high and rising hour by hour,"
1394,55,"and choked the steps too thick with clay to climb,"
1395,55,"what murk of air remained stank old, and sour"
1396,55,"with fumes of whizz-bangs, and the smell of men"
1397,55,"who'd lived there years, and left their curse in the den,"
1398,55,"if not their corpses,"
1399,55,
1400,55,there we herded from the blast
1401,55,"of whizz-bangs, but one found our door at last,"
1402,55,"buffeting eyes and breath, snuffing the candles,"
1403,55,and thud! flump! thud! down the steep steps came thumping
1404,55,"and sploshing in the flood, deluging muck -"
1405,55,"the sentry's body; then his rifle, handles"
1406,55,"of old boche bombs, and mud in ruck on ruck,"
1407,55,"we dredged him up, for killed, until he whined"
1408,55,"'o sir, my eyes - i'm blind, - i'm blind, i'm blind!'"
1409,55,"coaxing, i held a flame against his lids"
1410,55,and said if he could see the least blurred light
1411,55,"he was not blind; in time he'd get all right,"
1412,55,"'i can't' he sobbed, eyeballs, huge-bulged like squids',"
1413,55,watch my dreams still; but i forgot him there
1414,55,"in posting next for duty, and sending a scout"
1415,55,"to beg a stretcher somewhere, and flound'ring about"
1416,55,"to other posts under the shrieking air,"
1417,55,
1418,55,"those other wretches, how they bled and spewed,"
1419,55,"and one who would have drowned himself for good, -"
1420,55,"i try not to remember these things now,"
1421,55,"let dread hark back for one word only, how"
1422,55,"half-listening to that sentry's moans and jumps,"
1423,55,"and the wild chattering of his broken teeth,"
1424,55,renewed most horribly whenever crumps
1425,55,"pummelled the roof and slogged the air beneath, -"
1426,55,"through the dense din, i say, we heard him shout"
1427,55,"'i see your lights!' but ours had long died out,"
1428,56,"my soul looked down from a vague height with death,"
1429,56,"as unremembering how i rose or why,"
1430,56,"and saw a sad land, weak with sweats of dearth,"
1431,56,"gray, cratered like the moon with hollow woe,"
1432,56,"and fitted with great pocks and scabs of plaques,"
1433,56,
1434,56,"across its beard, that horror of harsh wire,"
1435,56,"there moved thin caterpillars, slowly uncoiled,"
1436,56,it seemed they pushed themselves to be as plugs
1437,56,"of ditches, where they writhed and shrivelled, killed,"
1438,56,
1439,56,by them had slimy paths been trailed and scraped
1440,56,"round myriad warts that might be little hills,"
1441,56,
1442,56,"from gloom's last dregs these long-strung creatures crept,"
1443,56,"and vanished out of dawn down hidden holes,"
1444,56,
1445,56,and smell came up from those foul openings
1446,56,"as out of mouths, or deep wounds deepening,"
1447,56,
1448,56,"on dithering feet upgathered, more and more,"
1449,56,"brown strings towards strings of gray, with bristling spines,"
1450,56,"all migrants from green fields, intent on mire,"
1451,56,
1452,56,"those that were gray, of more abundant spawns,"
1453,56,"ramped on the rest and ate them and were eaten,"
1454,56,
1455,56,"i saw their bitten backs curve, loop, and straighten,"
1456,56,"i watched those agonies curl, lift, and flatten,"
1457,56,
1458,56,"whereat, in terror what that sight might mean,"
1459,56,"i reeled and shivered earthward like a feather,"
1460,56,
1461,56,"and death fell with me, like a deepening moan,"
1462,56,"and he, picking a manner of worm, which half had hid"
1463,56,"its bruises in the earth, but crawled no further,"
1464,56,"showed me its feet, the feet of many men,"
1465,56,"and the fresh-severed head of it, my head,"
1466,57,suddenly night crushed out the day and hurled
1467,57,"her remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled,"
1468,57,then fell a stillness such as harks appalled
1469,57,"when far-gone dead return upon the world,"
1470,57,
1471,57,"there watched i for the dead; but no ghost woke,"
1472,57,"each one whom life exiled i named and called,"
1473,57,"but they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,"
1474,57,"and never one fared back to me or spoke,"
1475,57,
1476,57,then peered the indefinite unshapen dawn
1477,57,"with vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,"
1478,57,"the weak-limned hour when sick men's sighs are drained,"
1479,57,"and while i wondered on their being withdrawn,"
1480,57,"gagged by the smothering wing which none unbinds,"
1481,57,"i dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained,"
1482,58,so neck to neck and obstinate knee to knee
1483,58,wrestled those two; and peerless heracles
1484,58,could not prevail nor catch at any vantage;
1485,58,but those huge hands which small had strangled snakes
1486,58,let slip the writhing of antaeas' wrists;
1487,58,those clubs of hands that wrenched the necks of bulls
1488,58,now fumbled round the slim antaeas' limbs
1489,58,"baffled, then anger swelled in heracles,"
1490,58,"and terribly he grappled broader arms,"
1491,58,"and yet more firmly fixed his grasping feet,"
1492,58,and up his back the muscles bulged and shone
1493,58,"like climbing banks and domes of towering cloud,"
1494,58,"many who watched that wrestling say he laughed,-"
1495,58,"but not so loud as on eurystheus of old,"
1496,58,"but that his pantings, seldom loosed, long pent,"
1497,58,"were like the sighs of lions at their meat,"
1498,58,"men say their fettered fury tightened hour by hour,"
1499,58,until the veins rose tubrous on their brows
1500,58,"and froth flew thickly-shivered from both beards,"
1501,58,"as pythons shudder, bridling-in their spite,"
1502,58,"so trembled that antaeas with held strength,"
1503,58,"while heracles, - the thews and cordage of his thighs"
1504,58,straitened and strained beyond the utmost stretch
1505,58,from quivering heel to haunch like sweating hawsers -
1506,58,"but only staggered backward, then his throat"
1507,58,"growled, like a great beast when his meat is touched,"
1508,58,"as if he smelt some guile behind antaeas,"
1509,58,and knew the buttressed bulking of his shoulders
1510,58,"bore not the mass to move it one thumb's length,"
1511,58,"but what it was so helped the man none guessed,"
1512,58,"save hylas, whom the fawns had once made wise"
1513,58,"how earth herself empowered him by her touch,"
1514,58,"gave him the grip and stringency of winter,"
1515,58,and all the ardour of the invincible spring;
1516,58,how all the blood of june glutted his heart;
1517,58,and the wild glow of huge autumnal storms
1518,58,"stirred on his face, and flickered from his eyes;"
1519,58,"how too, poseidon blessed him fatherly"
1520,58,"with wafts of vigour from the keen sea waves,"
1521,58,and with the subtle coil of currents -
1522,58,"strange underflows, that maddened heracles,"
1523,58,"and towards the night they sundered, neither thrown,"
1524,58,whereat came hylas running to his friend
1525,58,"with fans, and sponges in a laving-bowl,"
1526,58,"and brimmed his lord the beakerful he loved,"
1527,58,"which heracles took roughly, even from him,"
1528,58,"then spake that other from the place he stood,"
1529,58,"'o heracles, i know thy fights and labours,"
1530,58,"what man thou wert, and what thou art become,"
1531,58,"the lord of strength, queller of perilous monsters,"
1532,58,"hero of heroes, worthy immortal worship,"
1533,58,"but me thou canst not quell, for i, i come"
1534,58,"of earth, and to my father poseidon,"
1535,58,"whose strength ye know, and whose displeasure ye know,"
1536,58,"therefore be wise, and try me not again,"
1537,58,"but say thou findst me peer, and more than peer,'"
1538,58,"but heracles, of utter weariness,"
1539,58,"was loath to answer, either yea or nay,"
1540,58,"and a cruel murmur rankled through the crowd,"
1541,58,"now he whose knees propped up the head of him,"
1542,58,"over his lord's ear swiftly whispered thus,"
1543,58,"'if thou could'st lift the man in air - enough,"
1544,58,"his feet suck secret virtue of the earth,"
1545,58,"lift him, and buckle him to thy breast, and win,'"
1546,58,up sprang the son of perseus deeply laughing
1547,58,and ere the crimson of his last long clutch
1548,58,"had faded from that insolent's throat, again"
1549,58,"they closed, then he, the argonaut,"
1550,58,"remembering how he tore the oaks in argos,"
1551,58,bound both his arms about the other's loins
1552,58,"and with a sudden tugging, easily"
1553,58,"rooted him up; and crushed his inmost bones,"
1554,58,"forth to the town he strode, and through the streets,"
1555,58,"bearing the body light as leopard-skins,"
1556,58,and glorious ran the shouting as he strode -
1557,58,some say his footfalls made an earthquake there
1558,58,"so that he dropped antaeas, some say not,"
1559,58,but that he cast him down by gea's altar
1560,58,"and gea sent that earthquake for her son,"
1561,58,"to rouse him out of death, and lo! he rose,"
1562,58,"alive, and came to heracles"
1563,58,"who feasted with the people and their king,"
1564,58,and fain would all make place for him
1565,58,"but he would not consent, and heracles,"
1566,58,"knowing the hate of hylas for his deeds,"
1567,58,"feasted and slept; and so forgot the man,"
1568,58,and early on the morrow passed with hylas
1569,58,"down to the argo, for the wind was fair,"
1570,59,it is not death
1571,59,without hereafter
1572,59,to one in dearth
1573,59,"of life and its laughter,"
1574,59,
1575,59,nor the sweet murder
1576,59,dealt slow and even
1577,59,unto the martyr
1578,59,"smiling at heaven,"
1579,59,
1580,59,it is the smile
1581,59,"faint as a waning myth,"
1582,59,"faint, and exceeding small"
1583,59,"on a boy's murdered mouth,"
1584,60,not this week nor this month dare i lie down
1585,60,"in languour under lime trees or smooth smile,"
1586,60,"love must not kiss my face pale that is brown,"
1587,60,
1588,60,"my lips, parting, shall drink space, mile by mile;"
1589,60,strong meats be all my hunger; my renown
1590,60,"be the clean beauty of speed and pride of style,"
1591,60,
1592,60,cold winds encountered on the racing down
1593,60,shall thrill my heated bareness; but awhile
1594,60,"none else may meet me till i wear my crown,"
1595,61,it lieth low near merry england's heart
1596,61,like a long-buried sin; and englishmen
1597,61,"forget that in its death their sires had part,"
1598,61,"and, like a sin, time lays it bare again"
1599,61,"to tell of races wronged,"
1600,61,"and ancient glories suddenly overcast,"
1601,61,"and treasures flung to fire and rabble wrath,"
1602,61,if thou hast ever longed
1603,61,"to lift the gloomy curtain of time past,"
1604,61,"and spy the secret things that hades hath,"
1605,61,"here through this riven ground take such a view,"
1606,61,"the dust, that fell unnoted as a dew,"
1607,61,"wrapped the dead city's face like mummy-cloth,"
1608,61,"all is as was, except for worm and moth,"
1609,61,
1610,61,since jove was worshipped under wrekin's shade
1611,61,"or latin phrase was writ in shropshire stone,"
1612,61,since druid chaunts desponded in this glade
1613,61,"or tuscan general called that field his own,"
1614,61,how long ago? how long?
1615,61,how long since wanderers in the stretton hills
1616,61,"met men of shaggy hair and savage jaw,"
1617,61,"with flint and copper prong,"
1618,61,aiming behind their dikes and thorny grilles?
1619,61,"ah! those were days before the axe and saw,"
1620,61,then were the nights when this mid-forest town
1621,61,"held breath to hear the wolves come yelping down,"
1622,61,"and ponderous bears 'long severn lifted paw,"
1623,61,"and nuzzling boars ran grunting through the shaw,"
1624,61,
1625,61,ah me! full fifteen hundred times the wheat
1626,61,"hath risen, and bowed, and fallen to human hunger"
1627,61,"since those imperial days were made complete,"
1628,61,the weary moon hath waxen old and younger
1629,61,these eighteen thousand times
1630,61,"without a shrine to greet her gentle ray,"
1631,61,"and other temples rose; to power and pelf,"
1632,61,and chimed centurial chimes
1633,61,"until their very bells are worn away,"
1634,61,while king by king lay cold on vaulted shelf
1635,61,"and wars closed wars, and many a marmion fell,"
1636,61,and dearths and plagues holp sire and son to hell;
1637,61,and old age stiffened many a lively elf
1638,61,"and many a poet's heart outdrained itself,"
1639,61,
1640,61,i had forgot that so remote an age
1641,61,"beyond the horizon of our little sight,"
1642,61,is far from us by no more spanless gauge
1643,61,"than day and night, succeeding day and night,"
1644,61,"until i looked on thee,"
1645,61,"thou ghost of a dead city, or its husk!"
1646,61,but even as we could walk by field and hedge
1647,61,hence to the distant sea
1648,61,"so, by the rote of common dawn and dusk,"
1649,61,"we travel back to history's utmost edge,"
1650,61,"yea, when through thy old streets i took my way,"
1651,61,"and recked a thousand years as yesterday,"
1652,61,methought sage fancy wrought a sacrilege
1653,61,to steal for me such godly privilege!
1654,61,
1655,61,for here lie remnants from a banquet table -
1656,61,"oysters and marrow-bones, and seeds of grape -"
1657,61,the statement of whose age must sound a fable;
1658,61,"and samian jars, whose sheen and flawless shape"
1659,61,"look fresh from potter's mould,"
1660,61,plasters with roman finger-marks impressed;
1661,61,bracelets that from the warm italian arm
1662,61,might seem to be scarce cold;
1663,61,and spears - the same that pushed the cymry west-
1664,61,unblunted yet; with tools of forge and farm
1665,61,"abandoned, as a man in sudden fear"
1666,61,"drops what he holds to help his swift career,"
1667,61,"for sudden was rome's flight, and wild the alarm,"
1668,61,"the saxon shock was like vesuvius' qualm,"
1669,61,
1670,61,"o ye who prate of modern art and craft ,"
1671,61,"mark well that gaulish brooch, and test that screw!"
1672,61,"art's fairest buds on antique stem are graft,"
1673,61,under the sun is nothing wholly new!
1674,61,at viricon today
1675,61,the village anvil rests on roman base
1676,61,"and in a garden, may be seen a bower"
1677,61,with pillars for its stay
1678,61,"that anciently in basilic had place,"
1679,61,"the church's font is but a pagan dower,"
1680,61,"a temple's column, hollowed into this,"
1681,61,"so is the glory of our artifice,"
1682,61,"our pleasure and our worship, but the flower"
1683,61,"of roman custom and of roman power,"
1684,61,
1685,61,"o ye who laugh and, living as if time"
1686,61,"meant but the twelve hours ticking round your dial,"
1687,61,"find it too short for thee, watch the sublime,"
1688,61,"slow, epochal time-registers awhile,"
1689,61,"which are antiquities,"
1690,61,o ye who weep and call all your life too long
1691,61,"and moan, was ever sorrow like to mine?"
1692,61,muse on the memories
1693,61,"that sad sepulchral stones and ruins prolong,"
1694,61,here might men drink of wonder like strong wine
1695,61,"and feel ephemeral troubles soothed and curbed,"
1696,61,"yet farmers, wroth to have their laws disturbed,"
1697,61,are sooner roused for little loss to pine
1698,61,"than we are moved by mighty woes long syne,"
1699,61,
1700,61,"above this reverend ground, what traveller checks?"
1701,61,yet cities such as these one time would breed
1702,61,"apocalyptic visions of world-wrecks,"
1703,61,"let saxon men return to them, and heed!"
1704,61,"they slew and burnt,"
1705,61,"but after, prized what rome had given away"
1706,61,"out of her strength and her prosperity,"
1707,61,have they yet learnt
1708,61,the precious truth distilled from rome's decay?
1709,61,ruins! on england's heart press heavily!
1710,61,for rome hath left us more than walls and words
1711,61,and better yet shall leave; and more than herds
1712,61,or land or gold gave the celts to us in fee;
1713,61,"e'en blood, which makes poets sing and prophets see,"
1714,62,to siegfried sassoon
1715,62,
1716,62,my arms have mutinied against me -- brutes!
1717,62,"my fingers fidget like ten idle brats,"
1718,62,"my back's been stiff for hours, damned hours,"
1719,62,"death never gives his squad a stand-at-ease,"
1720,62,"i can't read,  there,  it's no use,  take your book,"
1721,62,"a short life and a merry one, my buck!"
1722,62,"we said we'd hate to grow dead old,  but now,"
1723,62,"not to live old seems awful,  not to renew"
1724,62,"my boyhood with my boys, and teach 'em hitting,"
1725,62,"shooting and hunting, -- all the arts of hurting!"
1726,62,"-- well, that's what i learnt,  that, and making money,"
1727,62,your fifty years in store seem none too many;
1728,62,"but i've five minutes,  god!  for just two years"
1729,62,to help myself to this good air of yours!
1730,62,one spring!  is one too hard to spare?  too long?
1731,62,"spring air would find its own way to my lung,"
1732,62,"and grow me legs as quick as lilac-shoots,"
1733,62,
1734,62,"yes, there's the orderly,  he'll change the sheets"
1735,62,"when i'm lugged out, oh, couldn't i do that?"
1736,62,"here in this coffin of a bed, i've thought"
1737,62,"i'd like to kneel and sweep his floors for ever, --"
1738,62,"and ask no nights off when the bustle's over,"
1739,62,for i'd enjoy the dirt; who's prejudiced
1740,62,"against a grimed hand when his own's quite dust, --"
1741,62,less live than specks that in the sun-shafts turn?
1742,62,"dear dust, -- in rooms, on roads, on faces' tan!"
1743,62,"i'd love to be a sweep's boy, black as town;"
1744,62,"yes, or a muckman,  must i be his load?"
1745,62,"a flea would do,  if one chap wasn't bloody,"
1746,62,"or went stone-cold, i'd find another body,"
1747,62,
1748,62,"which i shan't manage now,  unless it's yours,"
1749,62,"i shall stay in you, friend, for some few hours,"
1750,62,"you'll feel my heavy spirit chill your chest,"
1751,62,"and climb your throat on sobs, until it's chased"
1752,62,"on sighs, and wiped from off your lips by wind,"
1753,62,
1754,62,"i think on your rich breathing, brother, i'll be weaned"
1755,62,"to do without what blood remained me from my wound,"
1756,63,"the browns, the olives, and the yellows died,"
1757,63,and were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
1758,63,"each dawn and set of sun till christmastide,"
1759,63,"and when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,"
1760,63,"fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed,"
1761,63,
1762,63,"from off your face, into the winds of winter,"
1763,63,the sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
1764,63,"but they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,"
1765,63,"when paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,"
1766,63,"and through those snows my looks shall be soft-going,"
1767,64,not one corner of a foreign field
1768,64,but a span as wide as europe;
1769,64,"an appearance of a titan's grave,"
1770,64,"and the length thereof a thousand miles,"
1771,64,"it crossed all europe like a mystic road,"
1772,64,"or as the spirits' pathway lieth on the night,"
1773,64,and i heard a voice crying
1774,64,"this is the path of glory,"
1775,65,"so neck to stubborn neck, and obstinate knee to knee,"
1776,65,wrestled those two; and peerless heracles
1777,65,"could not prevail, nor get at any vantage,"
1778,65,"so those huge hands that, small, had snapped great snakes,"
1779,65,"let slip the writhing of antaeus' wrists,"
1780,65,"those hero's hands that wrenched the necks of bulls,"
1781,65,"now fumbled round the slim antaeus' limbs,"
1782,65,"baffled, then anger swelled in heracles,"
1783,65,"and terribly he grappled broader arms,"
1784,65,"and yet more firmly fixed his grasped feet,"
1785,65,and up his back the muscles bulged and shone
1786,65,"like climbing banks and domes of towering cloud,"
1787,65,"and they who watched that wrestling say he laughed,"
1788,65,"but no so loud as on eurystheus of old,"
1789,66,as bronze may be much beautified
1790,66,"by lying in the dark damp soil,"
1791,66,so men who fade in dust of warfare fade
1792,66,"fairer, and sorrow blooms their soul,"
1793,66,
1794,66,like pearls which noble women wear
1795,66,"and, tarnishing, awhile confide"
1796,66,"unto the old salt sea to feed,"
1797,66,"many return more lustrous than they were,"
1798,66,
1799,66,"but what of them buried profound,"
1800,66,"buried where we cqn no more find,"
1801,66,who [                                                   ]
1802,66,lie dark for ever under abysmal war?
1803,67,"cramped in that funnelled hole, they watched the dawn"
1804,67,open a jagged rim around; a yawn
1805,67,"of death's jaws, which had all but swallowed them"
1806,67,"stuck in the bottom of his throat of phlegm,"
1807,67,
1808,67,they were in one of many mouths of hell
1809,67,not seen of seers in visions; only felt
1810,67,as teeth of traps; when bones and the dead are smelt
1811,67,under the mud where long ago they fell
1812,67,"mixed with the sour sharp odour of the shell,"
1813,68,"all sounds have been as music to my listening,"
1814,68,"pacific lamentations of slow bells,"
1815,68,"the crunch of boots on blue snow rosy-glistening,"
1816,68,"shuffle of autumn leaves; and all farewells,"
1817,68,
1818,68,"bugles that sadden all the evening air,"
1819,68,and country bells clamouring their last appeals
1820,68,before [the] music of the evening prayer;
1821,68,"bridges, sonorous under carriage wheels,"
1822,68,
1823,68,"gurgle of sluicing surge through hollow rocks,"
1824,68,"the gluttonous lapping of the waves on weeds,"
1825,68,"whisper of grass; the myriad-tinkling flocks,"
1826,68,"the warbling drawl of flutes and shepherds' reeds,"
1827,68,
1828,68,the orchestral noises of october nights
1829,68,blowing   symphonetic storms
1830,68,of startled clarions  
1831,68,"drums, rumbling and rolling thunderous and  ,"
1832,68,
1833,68,"thrilling of throstles in the keen blue dawn,"
1834,68,"bees fumbling and fuming over sainfoin-fields,"
1835,69,"[i saw his round mouth's crimson deepen as it fell],"
1836,69,"like a sun, in his last deep hour;"
1837,69,"watched the magnificent recession of farewell,"
1838,69,"clouding, half gleam, half glower,"
1839,69,"and a last splendour burn the heavens of his cheek,"
1840,69,and in his eyes
1841,69,"the cold stars lighting, very old and bleak,"
1842,69,"in different skies,"
1843,70,"o world of many worlds, o life of lives,"
1844,70,      what centre hast thou? where am i?
1845,70,o whither is it thy fierce onrush drives?
1846,70,"      fight i, or drift; or stand; or fly?"
1847,70,
1848,70,"the loud machinery spins, points work in touch;"
1849,70,"      wheels whirl in systems, zone in zone,"
1850,70,"myself having sometime moved with such,"
1851,70,"      would strike a centre of mine own,"
1852,70,
1853,70,"lend hand, o fate, for i am down, am lost!"
1854,70,"      fainting by violence of the dance,"
1855,70,"ah thanks, i stand - the floor is crossed,"
1856,70,"      and i am where but few advance,"
1857,70,
1858,70,"i see men far below me where they swarm,"
1859,70,      haply above me - be it so!
1860,70,"does space to compass-points conform,"
1861,70,      and can we say a star stands high or low?
1862,70,
1863,70,not more complex the millions of the stars
1864,70,      than are the hearts of mortal brothers;
1865,70,as far remote as neptune from small mars
1866,70,"      is one man's nature from another's,"
1867,70,
1868,70,but all hold course unalterably fixed;
1869,70,"      they follow destinies foreplanned,"
1870,70,"i envy not these lives in their faith unmixed,"
1871,70,"      i would not step with such a band,"
1872,70,
1873,70,"to be a meteor, fast, eccentric, lone,"
1874,70,"      lawless; in passage through all spheres,"
1875,70,warning the earth of wider ways unknown
1876,70,"      and rousing men with heavenly fears,"
1877,70,
1878,70,this is the track reserved for my endeavour;
1879,70,"      spanless the erring way i wend,"
1880,70,blackness of darkness is my meed for ever?
1881,70,      and barren plunging without end?
1882,70,
1883,70,o glorious fear! those other wandering souls
1884,70,      high burning through that outer bourne
1885,70,"are lights unto themselves, fair aureoles"
1886,70,"      self-radiated these are worn,"
1887,70,
1888,70,and when in after times those stars return
1889,70,"      and strike once more earth's horizon,"
1890,70,"they gather many satellites astern,"
1891,70,"      for they are greater than this system's sun,"
