433,10,

458,11,"what is the song the children sing,"
459,11,"when doorway lilacs bloom in spring,"

851,21,we are the little folk--we!
852,21,"  too little to love or to hate,"
853,21,leave us alone and you'll see
854,21,  how we can drag down the state!
855,21,we are the worm in the wood!
856,21, we are the rot at the root!
857,21,we are the taint in the blood!
858,21,  we are the thorn in the foot!
859,21,
860,21,mistletoe  killing  an  oak--
861,21, rats gnawing cables in two--
862,21,moths making holes in a cloak--
863,21, how they must love what they do!
864,21,"yes--and we little folk too,"
865,21, we are busy as they--
866,21,working our works out of view--
867,21," watch, and you'll see it some day!"
868,21,
869,21,"no indeed! we are not strong,"
870,21," but we know peoples that are,"
871,21,"yes, and we'll guide them along"
872,21, to smash and destroy you in war!
873,21,we shall be slaves just the same?
874,21," yes, we have always been slaves,"
875,21,"but you--you will die of the shame,"
876,21, and then we shall dance on your graves!
877,21,
878,21,"we are the little folk, we, etc,"
879,22,"i do not look for holy saints to guide me on my way,"
880,22,"or male and female devilkins to lead my feet astray,"
881,22,"if these are added, i rejoice---if not, i shall not mind,"
882,22,"so long as i have leave and choice to meet my fellow-kind,"
883,22,for as we come and as we go and deadly-soon go we!
884,22,"the people, lord, thy people, are good enough for me!"
885,22,
886,22,thus i will honour pious men whose virtue shines so bright
887,22,"though none are more amazed than i when i by chance do right,"
888,22,and i will pity foolish men for woe their sins have bred
889,22,"though ninety-nine per cent, of mine i brought on my own head,"
890,22,"and, amorite or eremite, or general averagee,"
891,22,"the people, lord, thy people, are good enough for me!"
892,22,
893,22,"and when they bore me overmuch, i will not shake mine ears,"
894,22,"recalling many thousand such whom i have bored to tears,"
895,22,"and when they labour to impress, i will not doubt nor scoff;"
896,22,"since i myself have done no less and---sometimes pulled it off,"
897,22,"yea, as we are and we are not, and we pretend to be,"
898,22,"the people, lord, thy people, are good enough for me!"
899,22,
900,22,"and when they work me random wrong, as oftentimes hath been,"
901,22,"i will not cherish hate too long my hands are none too clean,"
902,22,"and when they do me random good i will not feign surprise,"
903,22,"no more than those whom i have cheered with wayside charities,"
904,22,"but, as we give and as we take---whate'er our takings be---"
905,22,"the people, lord, thy people, are good enough for me!"
906,22,
907,22,but when i meet with frantic folk who sinfully declare
908,22,"there is no pardon for their sin, the same i will not spare"
909,22,till i have proved that heaven and hell which in our hearts we have
910,22,"show nothing irredeemable on either side of the grave,"
911,22,for as we live and as we die---if utter death there be---
912,22,"the people, lord, thy people, are good enough for me!"
913,22,
914,22,"deliver me from every pride---the middle, high, and low---"
915,22,"that bars me from a brother's side, whatever pride he show,"
916,22,and purge me from all heresies of thought and speech and pen
917,22,"that bid me judge him otherwise than i am judged, amen!"
918,22,"that i may sing of crowd or king or road-borne company,"
919,22,"that i may labour in my day, vocation and degree,"
920,22,"to prove the same in deed and name, and hold unshakenly"
921,22,"where'er i go, whate'er i know, whoe'er my neighbor be"
922,22,"this single faith in life and death and to eternity,"
923,22,"``the people, lord, thy people, are good enough for me!''"
924,23,to all to whom this little book may come--
925,23,  health for yourselves and those you hold most dear!
926,23,"content abroad, and happiness at home,"
927,23,"  and--one grand secret in your private ear, --"
928,23,"nations have passed away and left no traces,"
929,23,and history gives the naked cause of it--
930,23,"  one single, simple reason in all cases;"
931,23,"they fell because their peoples were not fit,"
932,23,
933,23,"now, though your body be mis-shapen, blind,"
934,23," lame, feverish, lacking substance, power or skill,"
935,23,certain it is that men can school the mind
936,23," to school the sickliest body, to her will--"
937,23," as many have done, whose glory blazes still"
938,23,"like mighty flames in meanest lanterns lit,"
939,23," wherefore, we pray the crippled, weak and ill--"
940,23,be fit--be fit! in mind at first be fit!
941,23,
942,23,"and, though your spirit seem uncouth or small,"
943,23," stubborn as clay or shifting as the sand,"
944,23,"strengthen the body, and the body shall"
945,23, strengthen the spirit till she take command;
946,23, as a bold rider brings his horse in hand
947,23,"at the tall fence, with voice and heel and bit,"
948,23," and leaps while all the field are at a stand,"
949,23,be fit--be fit! in body next be fit!
950,23,
951,23," nothing on earth--no arts, no gifts, no graces--"
952,23,"      no fame, no wealth--outweighs the wont of it,"
953,23,    this is the law which every law embraces--
954,23,      be fit--be fit! in mind and body be fit!
955,23,
956,23,the even heart that seldom slurs its beat--
957,23, the cool head weighing what that heart desires--
958,23,the measuring eye that guides the hands and feet--
959,23, the soul unbroken when the body tires--
960,23, these are the things our weary world requires
961,23,far more than superfluities of wit;
962,23," wherefore we pray you, sons of generous sires,"
963,23,"be fit--be fit! for honour's sake be fit,"
964,23,
965,23, there is one lesson at all times and places--
966,23,"      one changeless truth on all things changing writ,"
967,23,"    for boys and girls, men, women, nations, races--"
968,23,"      be fit -- be fit! and once again, be fit!"
969,24,what boots it on the gods to call?
970,24," since, answered or unheard,"
971,24,we perish with the gods and all
972,24," things made--except the word,"
973,24,
974,24,ere certain fate had touched a heart
975,24," by fifty years made cold,"
976,24,"i judged thee, lyde, and thy art"
977,24," o'erblown and over-bold,"
978,24,
979,24,"but he--but he, of whom bereft"
980,24, i suffer vacant days--
981,24,he on his shield not meanly left
982,24," he cherished all thy lays,"
983,24,
984,24,witness the magic coffer stocked
985,24, with convoluted runes
986,24,wherein thy very voice was locked
987,24,"  and linked to circling tunes,"
988,24,
989,24,"witness thy portrait, smoke-defiled,"
990,24," that decked his shelter-place,"
991,24,"life seemed more present, wrote the child,"
992,24," beneath thy well-known face,"
993,24,
994,24,and when the grudging days restored
995,24," him for a breath to home,"
996,24,"he, with fresh crowds of youth, adored"
997,24," thee making mirth in rome,"
998,24,
999,24,"therefore, i humble, join the hosts,"
1000,24," loyal and loud, who bow"
1001,24,"to thee as queen of song--and ghosts,"
1002,24, for i remember how
1003,24,
1004,24,never more rampant rose the hall
1005,24, at thy audacious line
1006,24,than when the news came in from gaul
1007,24," thy son had--followed mine,"
1008,24,
1009,24,but thou didst hide it in thy breast
1010,24," and, capering, took the brunt"
1011,24,"of blaze and blare, and launched the jest"
1012,24," that swept next week the front,"
1013,24,
1014,24,singer to children!   ours possessed
1015,24," sleep before noon--but thee,"
1016,24,"wakeful each midnight for the rest,"
1017,24, no holocaust shall free!
1018,24,
1019,24,"yet they who use the word assigned,"
1020,24," to hearten and make whole,"
1021,24,"not less than gods have served mankind,"
1022,24," though vultures rend their soul,"
1023,25,"the, gods that are wiser than learning"
1024,25, but kinder than life have made sure
1025,25,no mortal may boast in the morning
1026,25," that even will find him secure,"
1027,25,"with naught for fresh faith or new trial,"
1028,25," with little unsoiled or unsold,"
1029,25,"can the shadow go back on the dial,"
1030,25, or a new world be given for the old?
1031,25,"     but he knows not that time shall awaken,"
1032,25,"       as he knows not what tide shall lay bare,"
1033,25,     the heart of a man to be taken --
1034,25,"      taken and changed unaware,"
1035,25,
1036,25,he shall see as he tenders his vows
1037,25,"  the far, guarded city arise --"
1038,25,the power of the north 'twixt her brows --
1039,25,  the steel of the north in her eyes;
1040,25,the sheer hosts of heaven above --
1041,25,  the grey warlock ocean beside;
1042,25,and shall feel the full centuries move
1043,25,"  to her purpose and pride,"
1044,25,
1045,25,"though a stranger shall he understand,"
1046,25," as though it were old in his blood,"
1047,25,the lives that caught fire 'neath her hand --
1048,25," the fires that were tamed to her mood,"
1049,25,"and the roar of the wind shall refashion,"
1050,25," and the wind-driven torches recall,"
1051,25,the passing of time and the passion
1052,25, of youth over all!
1053,25,"     and, by virtue of magic unspoken"
1054,25,       what need she should utter her power?
1055,25,     the frost at his heart shall be broken
1056,25,       and his spirit be changed in that hour --
1057,25,    changed and renewed in that hour!
1058,26,once red ripple came to land
1059,26,    in the golden sunset burning--
1060,26,"  lapped against a maiden's hand,"
1061,26,"    by the ford returning,"
1062,26,
1063,26,  dainty foot and gentle breast--
1064,26,"  here, across, be glad and rest,"
1065,26,"  maiden, wait, the ripple saith;"
1066,26,"  wait awhile, for i am death!"
1067,26,
1068,26,  where my lover calls i go--
1069,26,    shame it were to treat him coldly--
1070,26,"  'twas a fish that circled so,"
1071,26,"    turning over boldly,"
1072,26,
1073,26,"  dainty foot and tender heart,"
1074,26,"  wait the loaded ferry-raft,"
1075,26,"  wait, ah, wait! the ripple saith;"
1076,26,"  maiden, wait, for i am death!"
1077,26,
1078,26,  when my lover calls i haste--
1079,26,    dame disdain was never wedded!
1080,26,"  ripple-ripple round her waist,"
1081,26,"    clear the current eddied,"
1082,26,
1083,26,"  foolish heart and faithful hand,"
1084,26,"  little feet that touched no land,"
1085,26,"  far away the ripple sped,"
1086,26,  ripple-ripple running red!
1087,27,let us now praise famous men--
1088,27,    men of little showing--
1089,27,"for their work continueth,"
1090,27,"and their work continueth,  "
1091,27,"broad and deep continues,"
1092,27,   greater then their knowing!
1093,27,
1094,27,western wind and open surge
1095,27,   took us from our mothers--
1096,27,flung us on a naked shore
1097,27,"twelve bleak houses by the shore,"
1098,27,seven summers by the shore! 
1099,27,"   'mid two hundred brothers,"
1100,27,
1101,27,there we met with famous men
1102,27,   set in office o'er us;
1103,27,and they beat on us with rods--
1104,27,faithfully with many rods--
1105,27,"daily beat us on with rods,"
1106,27,    for the love they bore us!
1107,27,
1108,27,out of egypt unto troy--
1109,27,   over himalaya--
1110,27,far and sure our bands have gone--
1111,27,"hy-brazil or babylon,"
1112,27,"islands of the southern run,"
1113,27,  and cities of cathaia!
1114,27,
1115,27,and we all praise famous men--
1116,27,   ancients of the college;
1117,27,for they taught us common sense--
1118,27,tried to teach us common sense--
1119,27,"truth and god's own common sense,"
1120,27,   which is more than knowledge!
1121,27,
1122,27,each degree of latitude
1123,27,   strung about creation
1124,27,seeth one or more of us
1125,27,"of one muster each of us,"
1126,27,"diligent in that he does,"
1127,27,"   keen in his vocation,"
1128,27,
1129,27,"this we learned from famous men,"
1130,27,"    knowing not its uses,"
1131,27,"when they showed, in daily work--"
1132,27,man must finish off his work--
1133,27,"right or wrong, his daily work--"
1134,27,"   and without excuses,"
1135,27,
1136,27,"servant of the staff and chain,"
1137,27, mine and fuse and grapnel--
1138,27,"some, before the face of kings,"
1139,27,stand before the face of kings;
1140,27,bearing gifts to divers kings--
1141,27," gifts of case and shrapnel,"
1142,27,
1143,27,this we learned from famous men
1144,27," teaching in our borders,"
1145,27,"who declared it was best,"
1146,27,"safest,  easiest,  and best--"
1147,27,"expeditious, wise, and best--"
1148,27," to obey your orders,"
1149,27,
1150,27,some beneath the further stars
1151,27," bear the greater burden,"
1152,27,"set to serve the lands they rule,"
1153,27,"save he serve no man may rule,"
1154,27,serve and love the lands they rule;
1155,27," seeking praise nor guerdon,"
1156,27,
1157,27,"this we learned from famous men,"
1158,27," knowing not we learned it,"
1159,27,"only, as the years went by--"
1160,27,"lonely, as the years went by--"
1161,27,"far from help as years went by,"
1162,27," plainer we discerned it,"
1163,27,
1164,27,wherefore praise we famous men
1165,27, from whose bays we borrow--
1166,27,they that put aside to-day--
1167,27,all the joys of their to-day--
1168,27,and with toil of their to-day
1169,27, bought for us to-morrow!
1170,27,
1171,27,bless and praise we famous men--
1172,27, men of little showing--
1173,27,"for their work continueth,"
1174,27,"and their work continueth,"
1175,27,"broad and deep continueth,"
1176,27,  great beyond their knowing!
1177,28,three things make earth unquiet
1178,28,and four she cannot brook
1179,28,the godly agur counted them
1180,28,and put them in a book --
1181,28,those four tremendous curses
1182,28,with which mankind is cursed;
1183,28,but a servant when he reigneth
1184,28,"old agur entered first,"
1185,28,an handmaid that is mistress
1186,28,"we need not call upon,"
1187,28,a fool when he is full of meat
1188,28,"will fall asleep anon,"
1189,28,an odious woman married
1190,28,may bear a babe and mend;
1191,28,but a servant when he reigneth
1192,28,"is confusion to the end,"
1193,28,
1194,28,"his feet are swift to tumult,"
1195,28,"his hands are slow to toil,"
1196,28,"his ears are deaf to reason,"
1197,28,"his lips are loud in broil,"
1198,28,he knows no use for power
1199,28,"except to show his might,"
1200,28,he gives no heed to judgment
1201,28,"unless it prove him right,"
1202,28,
1203,28,because he served a master
1204,28,"before his kingship came,"
1205,28,and hid in all disaster
1206,28,"behind his master's name,"
1207,28,"so, when his folly opens"
1208,28,"the unnecessary hells,"
1209,28,a servant when he reigneth
1210,28,"throws the blame on some one else,"
1211,28,
1212,28,"his vows are lightly spoken,"
1213,28,"his faith is hard to bind,"
1214,28,"his trust is easy broken,"
1215,28,"he fears his fellow-kind,"
1216,28,the nearest mob will move him
1217,28,to break the pledge he gave --
1218,28,"oh, a servant when he reigneth"
1219,28,is more than ever slave!

1360,32,      through the naked words and mean
1361,32,      may ye see the truth between
1362,32,    as the singer knew and touched it in the ends of all the earth!
1363,33,"there's a pasture in a valley where the hanging woods divide,"
1364,33,and a herd lies down and ruminates in peace;
1365,33,"where the pheasant rules the nooning, and the owl the twilight tide,"
1366,33,"and the war-cries of our world die out and cease,"
1367,33,here i cast aside the burden that each weary week-day brings
1368,33,"and, delivered from the shadows i pursue,"

1370,33,such as sussex cattle feeding in the dew!
1371,33,"at the gate beside the river where the trouty shallows brawl,"
1372,33,"i know the pride that lobengula felt,"
1373,33,"when he bade the bars be lowered of the royal cattle kraal,"
1374,33,"and fifteen miles of oxen took the veldt,"
1375,33,from the walls of bulawayo in unbroken file they came
1376,33,"to where the mount of council cuts the blue , , ,"
1377,33,"i have only six and twenty, but the principle's the same"
1378,33,with my sussex cattle feeding in the dew!
1379,33,
1380,33,"to a luscious sound of tearing, where the clovered herbage rips,"
1381,33,"level-backed and level-bellied watch 'em move,"
1382,33,"see those shoulders, guess that heart-girth, praise those loins, admire those hips,"

1385,33,"and, where yon heifer lifts her head at call,"
1386,33,"mark the bosom's just abundance 'neath the gay and cleancut chin,"
1387,33,"and those eyes of juno, overlooking all!"
1388,33,

1393,33,"he shall mate with block-square virgins - kings shall seek his like in vain,"
1394,33,"while i multiply his stock a thousandfold,"
1395,33,"till an hungry world extol me, builder of a lofty strain"
1396,33,"that turns one standard ton at two years old,"
1397,33,

1402,33,now the footpaths fade and vanish; now the ferny clumps deceive;
1403,33,now the hedgerow-folk possess their fields anew;
1404,33,"now the herd is lost in darkness, and i bless them as i leave,"

1424,34,from labrador to guadeloupe;
1425,34,"till, elbowed out by sloven friends,"

1429,34,"or panic-blinded stabs and slays,"
1430,34,"blatant he bids the world bow down,"
1431,34,or cringing begs a crust of praise;
1432,34,
1433,34,"or, sombre-drunk, at mine and mart,"
1434,34,"he dubs his dreary brethren kings,"

1452,34,
1453,34,"inopportune, shrill-accented,"

1457,34,
1458,34,"how shall he clear himself, how reach"

1460,34,a brother hedged with alien speech
1461,34,"and lacking all interpreter,"
1462,34,

1466,34,"home, to the instant need of things,"
1467,34,
1468,34,"enslaved, illogical, elate,"
1469,34,"he greets th' embarrassed gods, nor fears"

1552,36,
1553,36,the lords of their hands assembled; from the east and the west they drew --

1557,36,
1558,36,"and the young king said, -- i have found it, the road to the rest ye seek,"

2555,58,"no, not combatants-only"
2556,58," details guarding the line,"
2557,58,
2558,58,we slip through the broken panel
2559,58, of fence by the ganger's shed;
2560,58,we drop to the waterless channel
2561,58, and the lean track overhead;
2562,58,
2563,58,"we stumble on refuse of rations,"
2564,58, the beef and the biscuit-tins;
2565,58,"we take our appointed stations,"
2566,58," and the endless night begins,"
2567,58,
2568,58,we hear the hottentot herders
2569,58, as the sheep click past to the fold --
2570,58,and the click of the restless girders
2571,58, as the steel contracts in the cold --
2572,58,
2573,58,voices of jackals calling
2574,58," and, loud in the hush between,"
2575,58,a morsel of dry earth falling
2576,58," from the flanks of the scarred ravine,"
2577,58,
2578,58,"and the solemn firmament marches,"
2579,58, and the hosts of heaven rise
2580,58,framed through the iron arches --
2581,58," banded and barred by the ties,"
2582,58,
2583,58,"till we feel the far track humming,"
2584,58," and we see her headlight plain,"
2585,58,and we gather and wait her coming --
2586,58," the wonderful north-bound train,"
2587,58,
2588,58,"few, forgotten and lonely,"
2589,58, where the white car-windows shine --
2590,58,"no, not combatants-only"
2591,58," details guarding the line,"
2592,58,
2593,58,"quick, ere the gift escape us!"
2594,58, out of the darkness we reach
2595,58,for a handful of week-old papers
2596,58," and a mouthful of human speech,"
2597,58,
2598,58,"and the monstrous heaven rejoices,"
2599,58," and the earth allows again,"
2600,58,"meetings, greetings, and voices"
2601,58," of women talking with men,"
2602,58,
2603,58,"so we return to our places,"
2604,58, as out on the bridge she rolls;
2605,58,"and the darkness covers our faces,"
2606,58," and the darkness re-enters our souls,"
2607,58,
2608,58,more than a little lonely
2609,58," where the lessening tail-lights shine,"
2610,58,no - not combatants - only
2611,58, details guarding the line!
2612,59,"i was very well pleased with what i knowed,"
2613,59,i reckoned myself no fool --
2614,59,"till i met with a maid on the brookland road,"
2615,59,"that turned me back to school,              "
2616,59,
2617,59,low down-low down!
2618,59,where the liddle green lanterns shine --
2619,59,"o maids, i've done with 'ee all but one,"
2620,59,and she can never be mine!
2621,59,
2622,59,"'twas right in the middest of a hot june night,"
2623,59,"with thunder duntin' round,"
2624,59,and i see her face by the fairy-light
2625,59,"that beats from off the ground,"
2626,59,
2627,59,"she only smiled and she never spoke,"
2628,59,she smiled and went away;
2629,59,but when she'd gone my heart was broke
2630,59,"and my wits was clean astray,"
2631,59,
2632,59,"o, stop your ringing and let me be --"
2633,59,"let be, o brookland bells!"
2634,59,"you'll ring old goodman out of the sea,"
2635,59,before i wed one else!
2636,59,
2637,59,"old goodman's farm is rank sea-sand,"
2638,59,and was this thousand year;
2639,59,but it shall turn to rich plough-land
2640,59,"before i change my dear,"
2641,59,
2642,59,"o, fairfield church is water-bound"
2643,59,from autumn to the spring;
2644,59,but it shall turn to high hill-ground
2645,59,"before my bells do ring,"
2646,59,
2647,59,"o, leave me walk on brookland road,"
2648,59,in the thunder and warm rain --
2649,59,"o, leave me look where my love goed,"
2650,59,and p'raps i'll see her again!
2651,59,
2652,59,low down -- low down!
2653,59,where the liddle green lanterns shine --
2654,59,"o maids, i've done with 'ee all but one,"
2655,59,and she can never be mine!
2656,60,"in the days of lace-ruffles, perukes and brocade"
2657,60, brown bess was a partner whom none could despise--
2658,60,"an out-spoken, flinty-lipped, brazen-faced jade,"
2659,60, with a habit of looking men straight in the eyes--
2660,60,at blenheim and ramillies fops would confess
2661,60,"they were pierced to the heart by the charms of brown bess,"
2662,60,
2663,60,"though her sight was not long and her weight was not small,"
2664,60," yet her actions were winning, her language was clear;"
2665,60,and everyone bowed as she opened the ball
2666,60," on the arm of some high-gaitered, grim grenadier,"
2667,60,half europe admitted the striking success
2668,60,"of the dances and routs that were given by brown bess,"
2669,60,
2670,60,"when ruffles were turned into stiff leather stocks,"
2671,60,"  and people wore pigtails instead of perukes,"
2672,60,"brown bess never altered her iron-grey locks,"
2673,60," she knew she was valued for more than her looks,"
2674,60,"oh, powder and patches was always my dress,"
2675,60,"and i think am killing enough, said brown bess,"
2676,60,
2677,60,"so she followed her red-coats, whatever they did,"
2678,60," from the heights of quebec to the plains of assaye,"
2679,60,"from gibraltar to acre, cape town and madrid,"
2680,60, and nothing about her was changed on the way;
2681,60,but most of the empire which now we possess
2682,60,"was won through those years by old-fashioned brown bess,"
2683,60,
2684,60,"in stubborn retreat or in stately advance,"
2685,60," from the portugal coast to the cork-woods of spain,"
2686,60,she had puzzled some excellent marshals of france
2687,60," till none of them wanted to meet her again,"
2688,60,"but later, near brussels, napoleon--no less--"
2689,60,"arranged for a waterloo ball with brown bess,"
2690,60,
2691,60,she had danced till the dawn of that terrible day--
2692,60,"  she danced till the dusk of more terrible night,"
2693,60,"and before her linked squares his battalions gave way,"
2694,60,"  and her long fierce quadrilles put his lancers to flight,"
2695,60,"and when his gilt carriage drove off in the press,  "
2696,60,"i have danced my last dance for the world! said brown bess,"
2697,60,
2698,60,if you go to museums--there's one in whitehall--
2699,60," where old weapons are shown with their names writ beneath,"
2700,60,"you will find her, upstanding, her back to the wall,"
2701,60," as stiff as a ramrod, the flint in her teeth,"
2702,60,and if ever we english had reason to bless
2703,60,"any arm save our mothers', that arm is brown bess!"
2704,61,one who treated the narrow way
2705,61,"by tophet-flare to judgment day,"
2706,61,be gentle when the heathen pray
2707,61, to buddha at kamakura!
2708,61,
2709,61,"to him the way, the law, apart,"
2710,61,"whom maya held beneath her heart,"
2711,61,"ananda's lord, the bodhisat,"
2712,61," the buddha of kamakura,"
2713,61,
2714,61,"for though he neither burns nor sees,"
2715,61,"nor hears ye thank your deities,"
2716,61,"ye have not sinned with such as these,"
2717,61," his children at kamakura,"
2718,61,
2719,61,yet spare us still the western joke
2720,61,when joss-sticks turn to scented smoke
2721,61,the little sins of little folk
2722,61, that worship at kamakura --
2723,61,
2724,61,"the grey-robed, gay-sashed butterflies"
2725,61,"that flit beneath the master's eyes,"
2726,61,he is beyond the mysteries
2727,61," but loves them at kamakura,"
2728,61,
2729,61,"and whoso will, from pride released,"
2730,61,"contemning neither creed nor priest,"
2731,61,may feel the soul of all the east
2732,61," about him at kamakura,"
2733,61,
2734,61,"yea, every tale ananda heard,"
2735,61,"of birth as fish or beast or bird,"
2736,61,"while yet in lives the master stirred,"
2737,61," the warm wind brings kamakura,"
2738,61,
2739,61,till drowsy eyelids seem to see
2740,61,a-flower 'neath her golden htee
2741,61,the shwe-dagon flare easterly
2742,61," from burmah to kamakura,"
2743,61,
2744,61,and down the loaded air there comes
2745,61,"the thunder of thibetan drums,"
2746,61,and droned -- om mane padme hums --
2747,61," a world's-width from kamakura,"
2748,61,
2749,61,"yet brahmans rule benares still,"
2750,61,"buddh-gaya's ruins pit the hill,"
2751,61,and beef-fed zealots threaten ill
2752,61," to buddha and kamakura,"
2753,61,
2754,61,"a tourist-show, a legend told,"
2755,61,"a rusting bulk of bronze and gold,"
2756,61,"s o much, and scarce so much, ye hold"
2757,61, the meaning of kamakura?
2758,61,
2759,61,"but when the morning prayer is prayed,"
2760,61,"think, ere ye pass to strife and trade,"
2761,61,is god in human image made
2762,61," no nearer than kamakura,"
2763,62,"eyes aloft, over dangerous places,"
2764,62,"the children follow the butterflies,"
2765,62,"and, in the sweat of their upturned faces,"
2766,62,"slash with a net at the empty skies,"
2767,62,
2768,62,"so it goes they fall amid brambles,"
2769,62,"and sting their toes on the nettle-tops,"
2770,62,"till, after a thousand scratches and scrambles,"
2771,62,"they wipe their brows and the hunting stops,"
2772,62,
2773,62,then to quiet them comes their father
2774,62,"and stills the riot of pain and grief,"
2775,62,"saying,  little ones,  go and gather"
2776,62,"out of my garden a cabbage-leaf,"
2777,62,
2778,62,you will find on it whorls and clots of
2779,62,"dull grey eggs that, properly fed,"
2780,62,"turn, by way of the worm, to lots of"
2781,62,"glorious butterflies raised from the dead,  ,  ,  ,"
2782,62,
2783,62,"heaven is beautiful, earth is ugly,"
2784,62,the three-dimensioned preacher saith;
2785,62,so we must not look where the snail and the slug lie
2786,62,"for psyche's birth,  ,  ,  ,  and that is our death!"
2787,63,by the hoof of the wild goat uptossed
2788,63,   from the cliff where she lay in the sun
2789,63,   fell the stone
2790,63,"   to the tarn where the daylight is lost,"

2805,63,   the sin of the stone that was hurled
2806,63,"   by the goat from the light of the sun,"
2807,63,"   as she sinks in the mire of the tarn,"

3192,71,me!
3193,71,
3194,71,i will arise an' get 'ence --
3195,71,i will trek south and make sure
3196,71,if it's only my fancy or not
3197,71,"that the sunshine of england is pale,"
3198,71,"and the breezes of england are stale,"
3199,71,"an' there's something' gone small with the lot,"
3200,71,"for i know of a sun an' a wind,"
3201,71,"an' some plains and a mountain be'ind,"
3202,71,"an' some graves by a barb-wire fence,"
3203,71,an' a dutchman i've fought 'oo might give
3204,71,me a job where i ever inclined
3205,71,to look in an' offsaddle an' live
3206,71,where there's neither a road nor a tree --
3207,71,"but only my maker an' me,"
3208,71,"an i think it will kill me or cure,"
3209,71,"so i think i will go there an' see,"
3210,72,we've got the cholerer in camp -- it's worse than forty fights;
3211,72,we're dyin' in the wilderness the same as isrulites;
3212,72,"it's before us, an' be'ind us, an' we cannot get away,"
3213,72,an' the doctor's just reported we've ten more to-day!
3214,72,
3215,72,"    oh, strike your camp an' go, the bugle's callin',"
3216,72,        the rains are fallin' --
3217,72,    the dead are bushed an' stoned to keep 'em safe below;
3218,72,    the band's a-doin' all she knows to cheer us;
3219,72,    the chaplain's gone and prayed to gawd to 'ear us --
3220,72,        to 'ear us --
3221,72,"    o lord, for it's a-killin' of us so!"
3222,72,
3223,72,"since august, when it started, it's been stickin' to our tail,"
3224,72,though they've 'ad us out by marches an' they've 'ad us back by rail;
3225,72,"but it runs as fast as troop-trains, and we cannot get away;"
3226,72,"an' the sick-list to the colonel makes ten more to-day,"
3227,72,
3228,72,there ain't no fun in women nor there ain't no bite to drink;
3229,72,"it's much too wet for shootin', we can only march and think;"
3230,72,"an' at evenin', down the ~nullahs~, we can 'ear the jackals say,"
3231,72,"get up, you rotten beggars, you've ten more to-day!"
3232,72,
3233,72,'twould make a monkey cough to see our way o' doin' things --
3234,72,"lieutenants takin' companies an' captains takin' wings,"
3235,72,an' lances actin' sergeants -- eight file to obey --
3236,72,for we've lots o' quick promotion on ten deaths a day!
3237,72,
3238,72,"our colonel's white an' twitterly -- 'e gets no sleep nor food,"
3239,72,"but mucks about in 'orspital where nothing does no good,"
3240,72,"'e sends us 'eaps o' comforts, all bought from 'is pay --"
3241,72,"but there aren't much comfort 'andy on ten deaths a day,"
3242,72,
3243,72,"our chaplain's got a banjo, an' a skinny mule 'e rides,"
3244,72,"an' the stuff 'e says an' sings us, lord, it makes us split our sides!"
3245,72,with 'is black coat-tails a-bobbin' to ~ta-ra-ra boom-der-ay!~
3246,72,"'e's the proper kind o' ~padre~ for ten deaths a day,"
3247,72,
3248,72,an' father victor 'elps 'im with our roman catholicks --
3249,72,he knows an 'eap of irish songs an' rummy conjurin' tricks;
3250,72,an' the two they works together when it comes to play or pray;
3251,72,"so we keep the ball a-rollin' on ten deaths a day,"
3252,72,
3253,72,we've got the cholerer in camp -- we've got it 'ot an' sweet;
3254,72,"it ain't no christmas dinner, but it's 'elped an' we must eat,"
3255,72,"we've gone beyond the funkin', 'cause we've found it doesn't pay,"
3256,72,an' we're rockin' round the districk on ten deaths a day!
3257,72,
3258,72,"    then strike your camp an' go, the rains are fallin',"
3259,72,        the bugle's callin'!
3260,72,    the dead are bushed an' stoned to keep 'em safe below!
3261,72,"    an' them that do not like it they can lump it,"
3262,72,    an' them that cannot stand it they can jump it;
3263,72,    we've got to die somewhere -- some way -- some'ow --
3264,72,    we might as well begin to do it now!
3265,72,"    then, number one, let down the tent-pole slow,"
3266,72,    knock out the pegs an' 'old the corners -- so!
3267,72,"    fold in the flies, furl up the ropes, an' stow!"
3268,72,"    oh, strike -- oh, strike your camp an' go!"
3269,72,        gawd 'elp us!
3270,73,dim dawn behind the tamerisks -- the sky is saffron-yellow --
3271,73," as the women in the village grind the corn,"
3272,73,"and the parrots seek the riverside, each calling to his fellow"
3273,73," that the day, the staring easter day is born,"
3274,73,   oh the white dust on the highway! oh the stenches in the byway!
3275,73,     oh the clammy fog that hovers
3276,73,   and at home they're making merry 'neath the white and scarlet berry --
3277,73,     what part have india's exiles in their mirth?
3278,73,
3279,73,full day begind the tamarisks -- the sky is blue and staring --
3280,73," as the cattle crawl afield beneath the yoke,"
3281,73,"and they bear one o'er the field-path, who is past all hope or caring,"
3282,73," to the ghat below the curling wreaths of smoke,"
3283,73,"   call on rama, going slowly, as ye bear a brother lowly --"
3284,73,"     call on rama -- he may hear, perhaps, your voice!"
3285,73,"   with our hymn-books and our psalters we appeal to other altars,"
3286,73,     and to-day we bid good christian men rejoice!
3287,73,
3288,73,high noon behind the tamarisks -- the sun is hot above us --
3289,73," as at home the christmas day is breaking wan,"
3290,73,"they will drink our healths at dinner -- those who tell us how they love us,"
3291,73, and forget us till another year be gone!
3292,73,"   oh the toil that knows no breaking! oh the heimweh, ceaseless, aching!"
3293,73,     oh the black dividing sea and alien plain!
3294,73,"   youth was cheap -- wherefore we sold it,"
3295,73,"     gold was good -- we hoped to hold it,"
3296,73,"   and to-day we know the foulness of our gain,"
3297,73,
3298,73,grey dusk behind the tamarisks -- the parrots fly together --
3299,73, as the sun is sinking slowly over home;
3300,73,"and his last ray seems to mock us shackled in a lifelong tether,"
3301,73," that drags us back how'er so far we roam,"
3302,73,"   hard her service, poor her payment -- she is ancient, tattered raiment --"
3303,73,"     india, she the grim stepmother of our kind,"
3304,73,"   if a year of life be lent her, if her temple's shrine we enter,"
3305,73,"     the door is hut -- we may not look behind,"
3306,73,
3307,73,black night behind the tamarisks -- the owls begin their chorus --
3308,73," as the conches from the temple scream and bray,"
3309,73,"with the fruitless years behind us, and the hopeless years before us,"
3310,73," let us honor, o my brother, christmas day!"
3311,73,"   call a truce, then, to our labors -- let us feast with friends and neighbors,"
3312,73,     and be merry as the custom of our caste;
3313,73,"   for if faint and forced the laughter, and if sadness follow after,"
3314,73,"     we are richer by one mocking christmas past,"
3315,74,"cities and thrones and powers,"
3316,74,"            stand  in time's eye,"
3317,74,"        almost as long as flowers,"
3318,74,"          which daily die,"
3319,74,"        but, as new buds put forth"
3320,74,"          to glad new men,"
3321,74,"        out of the spent and unconsidered earth,"
3322,74,"            the cities rise again,"
3323,74,
3324,74,"         this season's daffodil,"
3325,74,"            she never hears,"
3326,74,"         what change, what chance, what chill,"
3327,74,            cut down last year's;
3328,74,"         but with bold countenance,"
3329,74,"            and  knowledge small,"
3330,74,"         esteems her seven days' continuance,"
3331,74,"             to be perpetual,"
3332,74,
3333,74,"           so time that is o'er -kind,"
3334,74,"              to all that be,"
3335,74,"            ordains us e'en as blind,"
3336,74,"             as bold as she,"
3337,74,"           that in our very death,"
3338,74,"             and  burial sure,"
3339,74,"           shadow to shadow, well persuaded, saith,"
3340,74,               see how our works endure!
3341,75,"help for a patriot distressed, a spotless spirit hurt,"
3342,75,help for an honourable clan sore trampled in the dirt!
3343,75,"from queenstown bay to donegal, o listen to my song,"
3344,75,"the honourable gentlemen have suffered grievous wrong,"
3345,75,
3346,75,their noble names were mentioned -- o the burning black disgrace! --
3347,75,by a brutal saxon paper in an irish shooting-case;
3348,75,"they sat upon it for a year, then steeled their heart to brave it,"
3349,75,"and coruscating innocence the learned judges gave it,"
3350,75,
3351,75,"bear witness, heaven, of that grim crime beneath the surgeon's knife,"
3352,75,the honourable gentlemen deplored the loss of life!
3353,75,"bear witness of those chanting choirs that burk and shirk and snigger,"
3354,75,no man laid hand upon the knife or finger to the trigger!
3355,75,
3356,75,"cleared in the face of all mankind beneath the winking skies,"
3357,75,like ph]oenixes from ph]oenix park and what lay there they rise!
3358,75,"go shout it to the emerald seas -- give word to erin now,"
3359,75,"her honourable gentlemen are cleared -- and this is how, --"
3360,75,
3361,75,"they only paid the moonlighter his cattle-hocking price,"
3362,75,"they only helped the murderer with counsel's best advice,"
3363,75,but -- sure it keeps their honour white -- the learned court believes
3364,75,"they never gave a piece of plate to murderers and thieves,"
3365,75,
3366,75,"they never told the ramping crowd to card a woman's hide,"
3367,75,they never marked a man for death -- what fault of theirs he died? --
3368,75,"they only said intimidate, and talked and went away --"
3369,75,"by god, the boys that did the work were braver men than they!"
3370,75,
3371,75,their sin it was that fed the fire -- small blame to them that heard --
3372,75,"the bhoys get drunk on rhetoric, and madden at a word --"
3373,75,"they knew whom they were talking at, if they were irish too,"
3374,75,"the gentlemen that lied in court, they knew, and well they knew,"
3375,75,
3376,75,"they only took the judas-gold from fenians out of jail,"
3377,75,"they only fawned for dollars on the blood-dyed clanna-gael,"
3378,75,"if black is black or white is white, in black and white it's down,"
3379,75,"they're only traitors to the queen and rebels to the crown,"
3380,75,
3381,75,"cleared, honourable gentlemen!  be thankful it's no more, --"
3382,75,"the widow's curse is on your house, the dead are at your door,"
3383,75,"on you the shame of open shame, on you from north to south"
3384,75,"the hand of every honest man flat-heeled across your mouth,"
3385,75,
3386,75,"less black than we were painted? -- faith, no word of black was said;"
3387,75,"the lightest touch was human blood, and that, you know, runs red,"
3388,75,"it's sticking to your fist to-day for all your sneer and scoff,"
3389,75,"and by the judge's well-weighed word you cannot wipe it off,"
3390,75,
3391,75,"hold up those hands of innocence -- go, scare your sheep together,"
3392,75,"the blundering, tripping tups that bleat behind the old bell-wether;"
3393,75,"and if they snuff the taint and break to find another pen,"
3394,75,"tell them it's tar that glistens so, and daub them yours again!"
3395,75,
3396,75,the charge is old? -- as old as cain -- as fresh as yesterday;
3397,75,old as the ten commandments -- have ye talked those laws away?
3398,75,"if words are words, or death is death, or powder sends the ball,"
3399,75,"you spoke the words that sped the shot -- the curse be on you all,"
3400,75,
3401,75,our friends believe? -- of course they do -- as sheltered women may;
3402,75,but have they seen the shrieking soul ripped from the quivering clay?
3403,75,"they! -- if their own front door is shut,"
3404,75, they'll swear the whole world's warm;
3405,75,what do they know of dread of death or hanging fear of harm?
3406,75,
3407,75,"the secret half a county keeps, the whisper in the lane,"
3408,75,"the shriek that tells the shot went home behind the broken pane,"
3409,75,"the dry blood crisping in the sun that scares the honest bees,"
3410,75,and shows the bhoys have heard your talk -- what do they know of these?
3411,75,
3412,75,"but you -- you know -- ay, ten times more; the secrets of the dead,"
3413,75,"black terror on the country-side by word and whisper bred,"
3414,75,"the mangled stallion's scream at night, the tail-cropped heifer's low,"
3415,75,"who set the whisper going first?  you know, and well you know!"
3416,75,
3417,75,"my soul!  i'd sooner lie in jail for murder plain and straight,"
3418,75,"pure crime i'd done with my own hand for money, lust, or hate,"
3419,75,"than take a seat in parliament by fellow-felons cheered,"
3420,75,"while one of those not provens proved me cleared as you are cleared,"
3421,75,
3422,75,"cleared -- you that lost the league accounts -- go, guard our honour still,"
3423,75,"go, help to make our country's laws that broke god's law at will --"
3424,75,"one hand stuck out behind the back, to signal strike again;"
3425,75,"the other on your dress-shirt-front to show your heart is clane,"
3426,75,
3427,75,"if black is black or white is white, in black and white it's down,"
3428,75,"you're only traitors to the queen and rebels to the crown,"
3429,75,"if print is print or words are words, the learned court perpends, --"
3430,75,"we are not ruled by murderers, but only -- by their friends,"
3431,76,gold is for the mistress -- silver for the maid --
3432,76,"copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade,"
3433,76,"good! said the baron, sitting in his hall,"
3434,76,"but iron -- cold iron -- is master of them all,"
3435,76,
3436,76,"so he made rebellion 'gainst the king his liege,"
3437,76,"camped before his citadel and summoned it to siege,"
3438,76,"nay! said the cannoneer on the castle wall,"
3439,76,but iron -- cold iron -- shall be master of you all!
3440,76,
3441,76,"woe for the baron and his knights so strong,"
3442,76,when the cruel cannon-balls laid 'em all along;
3443,76,"he was taken prisoner, he was cast in thrall,"
3444,76,and iron -- cold iron -- was master of it all!
3445,76,
3446,76,"yet his king spake kindly ah, how kind a lord!"
3447,76,what if i release thee now and give thee back thy sword?
3448,76,"nay! said the baron, mock not at my fall,"
3449,76,"for iron -- cold iron -- is master of men all,"
3450,76,
3451,76,"tears are for the craven, prayers are for the clown --"
3452,76,"halters for the silly neck that cannot keep a crown,"
3453,76,"as my loss is grievous, so my hope is small,"
3454,76,for iron -- cold iron -- must be master of men all!
3455,76,
3456,76,yet his king made answer few such kings there be!
3457,76,"here is bread and here is wine -- sit and sup with me,"
3458,76,"eat and drink in mary's name, the whiles i do recall"
3459,76,how iron -- cold iron -- can be master of men all!
3460,76,
3461,76,"he took the wine and blessed it, he blessed and brake the bread,"
3462,76,"with his own hands he served them, and presently he said,"
3463,76,"see! these hands they pierced with nails, outside my city wall,"
3464,76,"show iron -- cold iron -- to be master of men all,"
3465,76,
3466,76,"wounds are for the desperate, blows are for the strong,"
3467,76,"balm and oil for weary hearts all cut and bruised with wrong,"
3468,76,i forgive thy treason -- i redeem thy fall --
3469,76,for iron -- cold iron -- must be master of men all!

3472,76,"thrones and powers for mighty men who dare to take and hold,"
3473,76,"nay! said the baron, kneeling in his hall,"
3474,76,but iron -- cold iron -- is master of men all!
3475,76,iron out of calvary is master of men all!

3598,79,
3599,79,"for this is our office, to spy and make room,"

3919,89," but, when the pang was o'er,"
3920,89,sat down to wait her master's tread
3921,89," upon the golden floor,"
3922,89,
3923,89,with ears full-cock and anxious eye
3924,89, impatiently resigned;
3925,89,but ignorant that paradise
3926,89," did not admit her kind,"
3927,89,
3928,89,"persons with haloes, harps, and wings"
3929,89, assembled and reproved;
3930,89,"or talked to her of heavenly things,"
3931,89," but dinah never moved,"
3932,89,
3933,89,there was one step along the stair
3934,89, that led to heaven's gate;
3935,89,"and, till she heard it, her affair"
3936,89," was--she explained--to wait,"
3937,89,
3938,89,"and she explained with flattened ear,"
3939,89, bared lip and milky tooth--
3940,89,storming against ithuriel's spear
3941,89, that only proved her truth!
3942,89,
3943,89,sudden--far down the bridge of ghosts
3944,89, that anxious spirits clomb--
3945,89,"she caught that step in all the hosts,"
3946,89," and knew that he had come,"
3947,89,
3948,89,"she left them wondering what to do,"
3949,89," but not a doubt had she,"
3950,89,swifter than her own squeal she flew
3951,89, across the glassy sea;
3952,89,
3953,89,"flushing the cherubs every where,"
3954,89," and skidding as she ran,"
3955,89,she refuged under peter's chair
3956,89," and waited for her man,"

3959,89,
3960,89,"there spoke a spirit out of the press,"
3961,89," 'said,--have you any here"
3962,89,"that saved a fool from drunkenness,"
3963,89, and a coward from his fear?
3964,89,
3965,89,that turned a soul from dark to day
3966,89, when other help was vain;
3967,89,that snatched it from wanhope and made
3968,89, a cur a man again?
3969,89,
3970,89,"enter and look, said peter then,"
3971,89," and set the gate ajar,"
3972,89,if  know aught of women and men
3973,89," i trow she is not far,"
3974,89,
3975,89,"neither by virtue, speech nor art"
3976,89, nor hope of grace to win;
3977,89,but godless innocence of heart
3978,89," that never heard of sin,"
3979,89,
3980,89,neither by beauty nor belief
3981,89," nor white example shown,"
3982,89,something a wanton--more a thief--
3983,89," but--most of all--mine own,"
3984,89,
3985,89,"enter and look, said peter then,"
3986,89, and send you well to speed;
3987,89,"but, for all that i know of women and men"
3988,89," your riddle is hard to read,"
3989,89,
3990,89,"then flew dinah from under the chair,"
3991,89, into his arms she flew--
3992,89,and licked his face from chin to hair
3993,89, and peter passed them through!
3994,90,"it was an artless bandar, and he danced upon a pine,"
3995,90,"and much i wondered how he lived, and where the beast might dine,"
3996,90,"and many, many other things, till, o'er my morning smoke,"
3997,90,"i slept the sleep of idleness and dreamt that bandar spoke,"
3998,90,
3999,90,"he said, o man of many clothes! sad crawler on the hills!"
4000,90,"observe, i know not ranken's shop, nor ranken's monthly bills;"
4001,90,i take no heed to trousers or the coats that you call dress;
4002,90,"nor am i plagued with little cards for little drinks at mess,"
4003,90,
4004,90,"i steal the bunnia's grain at morn, at noon and eventide,"
4005,90,"for he is fat and i am spare, i roam the mountain side,"
4006,90,"i follow no man's carriage, and no, never in my life"
4007,90,"have i flirted at peliti's with another bandar's wife,"
4008,90,
4009,90,o man of futile fopperies -- unnecessary wraps;
4010,90,"i own no ponies in the hills, i drive no tall-wheeled traps;"
4011,90,"i buy me not twelve-button gloves, 'short-sixes' eke, or rings,"
4012,90,"nor do i waste at hamilton's my wealth on 'pretty things,'"
4013,90,
4014,90,"i quarrel with my wife at home, we never fight abroad;"
4015,90,"but mrs, b, has grasped the fact i am her only lord,"
4016,90,i never heard of fever -- dumps nor debts depress my soul;
4017,90,"and i pity and despise you! here he pouched my breakfast-roll,"
4018,90,
4019,90,"his hide was very mangy, and his face was very red,"
4020,90,"and ever and anon he scratched with energy his head,"
4021,90,"his manners were not always nice, but how my spirit cried"
4022,90,to be an artless bandar loose upon the mountain side!
4023,90,
4024,90,"so i answered, gentle bandar, and inscrutable decree"
4025,90,"makes thee a gleesome fleasome thou, and me a wretched me,"
4026,90,"go! depart in peace, my brother, to thy home amid the pine;"
4027,90,"yet forget not once a mortal wished to change his lot for thine,"
4028,91,"man dies too soon, beside his works half-planned,"
4029,91," his days are counted and reprieve is vain,"

4032,91,
4033,91,"send here the bold, the seekers of the way--"
4034,91," the passionless, the unshakable of soul,"
4035,91,"who serve the inmost mysteries of man's clay,"

4037,92,"eddi, priest of st, wilfrid"

4041,92,
4042,92,"but the saxons were keeping christmas,"
4043,92," and the night was stormy as well,"
4044,92,"nobody came to service,"
4045,92," though eddi rang the bell,"
4046,92,
4047,92,"'wicked weather for walking,"

4051,92,
4052,92,"the altar-lamps were lighted, --"
4053,92," an old marsh-donkey came,"
4054,92,"bold as a guest invited,"
4055,92," and stared at the guttering flame,"
4056,92,
4057,92,"the storm beat on at the windows,"
4058,92," the water splashed on the floor,"
4059,92,"and a wet, yoke-weary bullock"
4060,92," pushed in through the open door,"
4061,92,
4062,92,"how do i know what is greatest,"
4063,92, how do i know what is least?
4064,92,"that is my father's business,"
4065,92," said eddi, wilfrid's priest,"
4066,92,
4067,92,but -- three are gathered together --
4068,92," listen to me and attend,"
4069,92,"i bring good news, my brethren!"
4070,92," said eddi of manhood end,"
4071,92,
4072,92,and he told the ox of a manger
4073,92," and a stall in bethlehem,"
4074,92,"and he spoke to the ass of a rider,"
4075,92," that rode to jerusalem,"
4076,92,
4077,92,"they steamed and dripped in the chancel,"
4078,92," they listened and never stirred,"
4079,92,"while, just as though they were bishops,"
4080,92," eddi preached them the world,"
4081,92,
4082,92,till the gale blew off on the marshes
4083,92," and the windows showed the day,"
4084,92,and the ox and the ass together
4085,92," wheeled and clattered away,"
4086,92,
4087,92,"and when the saxons mocked him,"
4088,92," said eddi of manhood end,"
4089,92,i dare not shut his chapel
4090,92," on such as care to attend,"
4091,93,naked and grey the cotswolds stand
4092,93,"beneath the summer sun,"
4093,93,and the stubble fields on either hand
4094,93,"where sour and avon run,"
4095,93,there is no change in the patient land
4096,93,"that has bred us every one,"
4097,93,
4098,93,she should have passed in cloud and fire
4099,93,and saved us from this sin
4100,93,"of war--red war--'twixt child and sire,"
4101,93,"household and kith and kin,"
4102,93,"in the heart of a sleepy midland shire,"
4103,93,"with the harvest scarcely in,"
4104,93,
4105,93,but there is no change as we meet at last
4106,93,"on the brow-head or the plain,"
4107,93,and the raw astonished ranks stand fast
4108,93,to slay or to be slain
4109,93,by the men they knew in the kindly past
4110,93,that shall never come again--
4111,93,

4118,93,
4119,93,more bitter than death this day must prove
4120,93,"whichever way it go,"
4121,93,for the brothers of the maids we love
4122,93,make ready to lay low
4123,93,"their sisters' sweethearts, as we move"
4124,93,"against our dearest foe,"

4129,93,"no matter which they say,"
4130,93,the first dry rattle of new-drawn steel

4132,94,the road to en-dor is easy to tread
4133,94,"   for mother or yearning wife,"
4134,94," there, it is sure, we shall meet our dead"
4135,94,"  as they were even in life,"

4137,94,"for desolate hearts on the road to en-dor,"
4138,94,
4139,94,whispers shall comfort us out of the dark--
4140,94,  hands--ah god!--that we knew!
4141,94,"visions ,and voices --look and hark!--"
4142,94,"  shall prove that the tale is true,"

4144,94,"may' be hailed--at a price--on the road to en-dor,"
4145,94,
4146,94,but they are so deep in their new eclipse
4147,94," nothing they say can reach,"
4148,94,unless it be uttered by alien lips
4149,94," and i framed in a stranger's speech,"
4150,94,"the son must send word to the mother that bore,"
4151,94,"'through an hireling's mouth,   'tis the rule of en-dor,"
4152,94,
4153,94,and not for nothing these gifts are shown
4154,94," by such as delight our dead,"
4155,94,they must twitch and stiffen and slaver and groan
4156,94," ere the eyes are set in the head,"
4157,94,"and the voice from the belly begins,   therefore,"
4158,94,"we pay them a wage where they ply at en-dor,"
4159,94,
4160,94,"even so, we have need of faith"
4161,94," and patience to follow the clue,"
4162,94,"often, at first, what the dear one saith"
4163,94," is babble, or jest, or untrue,"
4164,94,lying spirits perplex us sore
4165,94,till  our  loves--and  their  lives--are  well-known at
4166,94,"       en-dor,   ,   ,   ,"
4167,94,
4168,94,oh the road to en-dor is the oldest road
4169,94,and the craziest road of all!
4170,94,"straight it runs to the witch's abode,"
4171,94,"as it did in the days of  saul,"
4172,94,and nothing has changed of the sorrow in store

4916,115,"turned three parts mussulman and one hindu,"
4917,115,"and lived among the gauri villagers,"
4918,115,"who gave him shelter and a wife or twain,"
4919,115,"and boasted that a thorough, full-blood sahib"
4920,115,"had come among them, thus he spent his time,"
4921,115,deeply indebted to the village shroff
4922,115,"who never asked for payment, always drunk,"
4923,115,"unclean, abominable, out-at-heels;"
4924,115,"forgetting that he was an englishman,"
4925,115,
4926,115,"you know they dammed the gauri with a dam,"
4927,115,and all the good contractors scamped their work

4929,115,"was used to dam the gauri -- which was cheap,"
4930,115,"and, therefore, proper, then the gauri burst,"
4931,115,and several hundred thousand cubic tons
4932,115,"of water dropped into the valley, flop,"
4933,115,"and drowned some five-and-twenty villagers,"
4934,115,and did a lakh or two of detriment
4935,115,"to crops and cattle, when the flood went down"
4936,115,"we found him dead, beneath an old dead horse,"
4937,115,"full six miles down the valley, so we said"
4938,115,"he was a victim to the demon drink,"

4943,115,"beneath the shadow of the big new dam,"

4945,115,accounting for the little loss of life
4946,115,only those five-and-twenty villagers
4947,115,"in this wise, -- on the evening of the flood,"
4948,115,"they heard the groaning of the rotten dam,"
4949,115,"and voices of the mountain devils, then"
4950,115,"and incarnation of the local god,"
4951,115,"mounted upon a monster-neighing horse,"
4952,115,"and flourishing a flail-like whip, came down,"
4953,115,"breathing ambrosia, to the villages,"
4954,115,and fell upon the simple villagers
4955,115,"with yells beyond the power of mortal throat,"
4956,115,"and blows beyond the power of mortal hand,"
4957,115,"and smote them with his flail-like whip, and drove"
4958,115,"them clamorous with terror up the hill,"
4959,115,"and scattered, with the monster-neighing steed,"
4960,115,"their crazy cottages about their ears,"
4961,115,"and generally cleared those villages,"
4962,115,"then came the water, and the local god,"
4963,115,"breathing ambrosia, flourishing his whip,"
4964,115,"and mounted on his monster-neighing steed,"
4965,115,went down the valley with the flying trees
4966,115,"and residue of homesteads, while they watched"
4967,115,"safe on the mountain-side these wondrous things,"
4968,115,"and knew that they were much beloved of heaven,"
4969,115,
4970,115,"wherefore, and when the dam was newly built,"
4971,115,"they raised a temple to the local god,"
4972,115,and burnt all manner of unsavoury things
4973,115,"upon his altar, and created priests,"
4974,115,"and blew into a conch and banged a bell,"
4975,115,and told the story of the gauri flood
4976,115,"with circumstance and much embroidery, , , ,"
4977,115,"so hi, the whiskified objectionable,"
4978,115,"unclean, abominable, out-at-heels,"
4979,115,became the tutelary deity
4980,115,"of all the gauri valley villages,"
4981,115,"and may in time become a solar myth,"
4982,116,unless you come of the gypsy stock

4984,116,lock your heart with a double lock

4988,116,and keep your eyes on your lawful own

4999,116,"plough and harrow and roll your land,"

5003,116,   then you can thrive on your boughten food
5004,116,"     as the gypsy vans come through,"
5005,116,   for it isn't nature the giorgio blood
5006,116,"     should love as the romany do,"
5007,116,
5008,116,unless you carry the gypsy eyes

5014,116,but don't run out in the midnight rain
5015,116," nor home in the morning dews,"
5016,116,   then you can buddle and shut your eyes
5017,116,"     as the gypsy vans come through,"
5018,116,   for it isn't fitting the giorgio ryes
5019,116,"     should walk as the romany do,"
5020,116,
5021,116,unless you come of the gypsy race

5023,116,be you careful of time and place
5024,116," and judgment and good name,"
5025,116,lose your life for to live your life

5027,116,"and when you are finished, your god and your wife"
5028,116, and the gipsies'll laugh at you!

5030,116,"           as the gypsy vans come through,"
5031,116,        for it isn't reason the giorgio race
5032,116,"          should die as the romany do,"
5033,117,"because i sought it far from men,"
5034,117,"     in deserts and alone,"

5774,142, and whispered round the nebulae
5775,142,    who loved jane?
5776,142,
5777,142,in a private limbo
5778,142," where none had thought to look,"
5779,142,sat a hampshire gentleman
5780,142," reading of a book,"
5781,142,it was called persuasion
5782,142, and it told the plain
5783,142,story of the love between
5784,142," him and jane,"
5785,142,
5786,142,"he heard the question,"
5787,142, circle heaven through--
5788,142,"closed the book and answered,"
5789,142, i did -- and do!
5790,142,quietly but speedily
5791,142, as captain wentworth moved
5792,142,entered into paradise
5793,142, the man jane loved!
5794,142,
5795,142,"jane lies in winchester, blessed be her shade!"
5796,142,"praise the lord for making her, and her for all she made,"
5797,142,"and while the stones of winchester--or milson street--remain,"
5798,142,"glory, love, and honour unto england's jane!"
5799,143,jubal sang of the wrath of god
5800,143,   and the curse of thistle and thorn--
5801,143,"but tubal got him a pointed rod,"
5802,143,"   and scrabbled the earth for corn,"
5803,143,"   old--old as that early mould,"
5804,143,        young as the sprouting grain--      
5805,143,   yearly green is the strife between
5806,143,        jubal and tubal cain!
5807,143,
5808,143,"jubal sang of the new-found sea,"
5809,143,  and the love that its waves divide--
5810,143,but tubal hollowed a fallen tree
5811,143,"   and passed to the further side,"
5812,143,"   black-black as the hurricane-wrack,"
5813,143,       salt as the under-main-
5814,143,   bitter and cold is the hate they hold--
5815,143,   jubal and tubal cain!
5816,143,
5817,143,jubal sang of the golden years
5818,143,   uhen wars and wounds shall cease--
5819,143,but tubal fashioned the hand-flung spears
5820,143,    and showed his neighbours peace
5821,143,    new--new as nine-point-two
5822,143,         older than lamech's slain--
5823,143,    roaring and loud is the feud avowed
5824,143,         twix'' jubal and tubal cain!
5825,143,
5826,143,jubal sang of the cliffs that bar
5827,143,   and the peaks that none may crown--
5828,143,but tubal clambered by jut and scar
5829,143,"   and there he builded a town,"
5830,143,"   high-high as the snowsheds lie,"
5831,143,        low as the culverts drain--
5832,143,   wherever they be they can never agree--
5833,143,         jubal and tubal cain!
5834,144,across a world where all men grieve
5835,144," and grieving strive the more,"
5836,144,the great days range like tides and leave
5837,144," our dead on every shore,"
5838,144,"heavy the load we undergo,"
5839,144," and our own hands prepare,"
5840,144,"if we have parley with the foe,"
5841,144," the load our sons must bear,"
5842,144,
5843,144,before we loose the word
5844,144," that bids new worlds to birth,"
5845,144,needs must we loosen first the sword
5846,144, of justice upon earth;
5847,144,or else all else is vain
5848,144," since life on earth began,"
5849,144,and the spent world sinks back again
5850,144," hopeless of god and man,"
5851,144,
5852,144,a people and their king
5853,144," through ancient sin grown strong,"
5854,144,because they feared no reckoning
5855,144, would set no bound to wrong;
5856,144,"but now their hour is past,"
5857,144, and we who bore it find
5858,144,evil incarnate hell at last
5859,144," to answer to mankind,"
5860,144,
5861,144,for agony and spoil
5862,144," of nations beat to dust,"
5863,144,for poisoned air and tortured soil
5864,144," and cold, commanded lust,"
5865,144,and every secret woe
5866,144," the shuddering waters saw,"
5867,144,"willed and fulfilled by high and low,"
5868,144," let them relearn the low,"
5869,144,
5870,144,"that when the dooms are read,"
5871,144," not high nor low shall say,--"
5872,144, my haughty or my humble head
5873,144," was saved me in this day,"
5874,144,"that, till the end of time,"
5875,144, their remnant shall recall
5876,144,"their fathers old, confederate crime"
5877,144," availed them not at all,"
5878,144,
5879,144,"that neither schools nor priests,"
5880,144, nor kings may build again
5881,144,a people with the heart of beasts
5882,144," made wise concerning men,"
5883,144,whereby our dead shall sleep
5884,144," in honour, unbetrayed,"
5885,144,and we in faith and honour keep
5886,144," that peace for which they paid,"
5887,145,"unto whose use the pregnant suns are poised,"
5888,145,with idiot moons and stars retracting stars?
5889,145,"creep thou between -- thy coming's all unnoised,"
5890,145,"heaven hath her high, as earth her baser, wars,"
5891,145,"heir to these tumults, this affright, that fray"
5892,145,"by adam's, fathers', own, sin bound alway;"
5893,145,"peer up, draw out thy horoscope and say"
5894,145,"which planet mends thy threadbare fate, or mars,"
5895,146,"oh hubshee, carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast!"
5896,146,"this is the message of kitchener who did not break you in jest,"
5897,146,it was permitted to him to fulfil the long-appointed years;
5898,146,"reaching the end ordained of old over your dead emirs,"
5899,146,
5900,146,"he stamped only before your walls, and the tomb ye knew was dust,"
5901,146,"he gathered up under his armpits all the swords of your trust,"
5902,146,"he set a guard on your granaries, securing the weak from the strong,"
5903,146,"he said, -- go work the waterwheels that were abolished so long,"
5904,146,
5905,146,"he said, -- go safely, being abased, i have accomplished my vow,"
5906,146,"that was the mercy of kitchener, cometh his madness now!"
5907,146,"he does not desire as ye desire, nor devise as ye devise,"
5908,146,"he is preparing a second host -- an army to make you wise,"
5909,146,
5910,146,"not at the mouth of his clean-lipped guns shall ye learn his name again,"
5911,146,"but letter by letter, from kaf to kaf, at the mouths of his chosen men,"
5912,146,"he has gone back to his own city, not seeking presents or bribes,"
5913,146,"but openly asking the english for money to buy you hakims and scribes,"
5914,146,
5915,146,"knowing that ye are forfeit by battle and have no right to live,"
5916,146,"he begs for money to bring you learning -- and all the english give,"
5917,146,"it is their treasure -- it is their pleasure -- thus are their hearts inclined,"
5918,146,for allah created the english mad -- the maddest of all mankind!
5919,146,
5920,146,"they do not consider the meaning ofthings; they consult not creed nor clan,"
5921,146,"behold, they clap the slave on the back, and behold, he ariseth a man!"
5922,146,"they terribly carpet the earth with dead, and before their cannon cool,"
5923,146,"they walk unarmed by twos and threes to call the living to school,"
5924,146,
5925,146,"how is this reason which is their reason to judge a scholar's worth,"
5926,146,by casting a ball at three straight sticks and defending the same with a fourth?
5927,146,"but this they do which is doubtless a spell and other matters more strange,"
5928,146,"until, by the operation of years, the hearts of their scholars change,"
5929,146,
5930,146,till these make come and go great boats or engines upon the rail
5931,146,but always the english watch near by to prop them when they fail;
5932,146,till these make laws of their own choice and judges of their
5933,146,"and all the mad english obey the judges and say that that law is good,"
5934,146,
5935,146,"certainly they were mad from of old; but i think one new thing,"
5936,146,that the magic whereby they work their magic -- wherefrom their fortunes spring --
5937,146,"may be that they show all peoples their magic and ask no price in return,"
5938,146,"wherefore, since ye are bond to that magic, o hubshee, make haste and learn!"
5939,146,
5940,146,"certainly also is kitchener mad, but one sure thing i know --"
5941,146,"if he who broke you be minded to teach you, to his madrissa go!"
5942,146,"go, and carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast,"
5943,146,"for he who did not slay you in sport, he will not teach you in jest,"
5944,147,"there's a whisper down the field where the year has shot her yield,"
5945,147,"and the ricks stand gray to the sun,"
5946,147,"singing, -- over then, come over, for the bee has quit the clover,"
5947,147,"and your english summer's done,"
5948,147,"   you have heard the beat of the off-shore wind,"
5949,147,   and the thresh of the deep-sea rain;
5950,147,   you have heard the song -- how long! how long?
5951,147,   pull out on the trail again!
5952,147,
5953,147,"  ha' done with the tents of shem, dear lass,"
5954,147,"  we've seen the seasons through,"
5955,147,"  and it's time to turn on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
5956,147,"  pull out, pull out, on the long trail -- the trail that is always new,"
5957,147,
5958,147,"it's north you may run to the rime-ringed sun,"
5959,147,or south to the blind horn's hate;
5960,147,"or east all the way into mississippi bay,"
5961,147,or west to the golden gate;
5962,147,"   where the blindest bluffs hold good, dear lass,"
5963,147,"   and the wildest tales are true,"
5964,147,"   and the men bulk big on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
5965,147,"   and life runs large on the long trail -- the trail that is always new,"
5966,147,
5967,147,"the days are sick and cold, and the skies are gray and old,"
5968,147,and the twice-breathed airs blow damp;
5969,147,and i'd sell my tired soul for the bucking beam-sea roll
5970,147,of a black bilbao tramp;
5971,147,"   with her load-line over her hatch, dear lass,"
5972,147,"   and a drunken dago crew,"
5973,147,"   and her nose held down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail"
5974,147,"   from cadiz bar on the long trail -- the trail that is always new,"
5975,147,
5976,147,"there be triple ways to take, of the eagle or the snake,"
5977,147,or the way of a man with a maid;
5978,147,but the fairest way to me is a ship's upon the sea
5979,147,"in the heel of the north-east trade,"
5980,147,"   can you hear the crash on her bows, dear lass,"
5981,147,"   and the drum of the racing screw,"
5982,147,"   as she ships it green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
5983,147,   as she lifts and 'scends on the long trail --
5984,147,     the trail that is always new?
5985,147,
5986,147,"see the shaking funnels roar, with the peter at the fore,"
5987,147,"and the fenders grind and heave,"
5988,147,"and the derricks clack and grate, as the tackle hooks the crate,"
5989,147,and the fall-rope whines through the sheave;
5990,147,"   it's gang-plank up and in, dear lass,"
5991,147,   it's hawsers warp her through!
5992,147,"   and it's all clear aft on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
5993,147,"   we're backing down on the long trail -- the trail that is always new,"
5994,147,
5995,147,"o the mutter overside, when the port-fog holds us tied,"
5996,147,and the sirens hoot their dread!
5997,147,when foot by foot we creep o'er the hueless viewless deep
5998,147,to the sob of the questing lead!
5999,147,"   it's down by the lower hope, dear lass,"
6000,147,"   with the gunfleet sands in view,"
6001,147,"   till the mouse swings green on the old trail,"
6002,147,"     our own trail, the out trail,"
6003,147,   and the gull light lifts on the long trail --
6004,147,"     the trail that is always new,"
6005,147,
6006,147,"o the blazing tropic night, when the wake's a welt of light"
6007,147,"that holds the hot sky tame,"
6008,147,and the steady fore-foot snores through the planet-powdered floors
6009,147,where the scared whale flukes in flame!
6010,147,"   her plates are scarred by the sun, dear lass,"
6011,147,"   and her ropes are taut with the dew,"
6012,147,"   for we're booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
6013,147,"   we're sagging south on the long trail -- the trail that is always new,"
6014,147,
6015,147,"then home, get her home, where the drunken rollers comb,"
6016,147,"and the shouting seas drive by,"
6017,147,"and the engines stamp and ring, and the wet bows reel and swing,"
6018,147,and the southern cross rides high!
6019,147,"   yes, the old lost stars wheel back, dear lass,"
6020,147,"   that blaze in the velvet blue,"
6021,147,"   they're all old friends on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
6022,147,   they're god's own guides on the long trail --
6023,147,"     the trail that is always new,"
6024,147,
6025,147,"fly forward, o my heart, from the foreland to the start --"
6026,147,"we're steaming all-too slow,"
6027,147,and it's twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle
6028,147,where the trumpet-orchids blow!
6029,147,"   you have heard the call of the off-shore wind,"
6030,147,   and the voice of the deep-sea rain;
6031,147,   you have heard the song -- how long! how long?
6032,147,   pull out on the trail again!
6033,147,
6034,147,"  the lord knows what we may find, dear lass,"
6035,147,  and the deuce knows what we may do --
6036,147,"  but we're back once more on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
6037,147,"  we're down, hull down on the long trail -- the trail that is always new,"
6038,148,my new-cut ashlar takes the light
6039,148,where crimson-blank the windows flare;
6040,148,"by my own work, before the night,"
6041,148,"great overseer i make my prayer,"
6042,148,
6043,148,"if there be good in that i wrought,"
6044,148,"thy hand compelled it, master, thine;"
6045,148,where i have failed to meet thy thought
6046,148,"i know, through thee, the blame is mine,"
6047,148,
6048,148,one instant's toil to thee denied
6049,148,"stands all eternity's offence,"
6050,148,of that i did with thee to guide
6051,148,"to thee, through thee, be excellence,"
6052,148,
6053,148,"who, lest all thought of eden fade,"
6054,148,"bring'st eden to the craftsman's brain,"
6055,148,godlike to muse o'er his own trade
6056,148,"and manlike stand with god again,"
6057,148,
6058,148,"the depth and dream of my desire,"
6059,148,"the bitter paths wherein i stray,"
6060,148,"thou knowest who hast made the fire,"
6061,148,thou knowest who hast made the clay!
6062,148,
6063,148,one stone the more swings to her place
6064,148,in that dread temple of thy worth --
6065,148,it is enough that through thy grace
6066,148,"i saw naught common on thy earth,"
6067,148,
6068,148,take not that vision from my ken;
6069,148,"oh whatsoe'er may spoil or speed,"
6070,148,help me to need no aid from men
6071,148,that i may help such men as need!
6072,149,a much-discerning public hold
6073,149,   the singer generally sings
6074,149," and prints and sells his past for gold,"
6075,149,
6076,149," whatever i may here disclaim,"
6077,149,   the very clever folk i sing to
6078,149,   will most indubitably cling to
6079,149," their pet delusion, just the same,"
6080,149,
6081,149,"i had seen, as the dawn was breaking"
6082,149," and i staggered to my rest,"
6083,149,tari devi softly shaking
6084,149," from the cart road to the crest,"
6085,149,i had seen the spurs of jakko
6086,149," heave and quiver, swell and sink,"
6087,149,"was it earthquake or tobacco,"
6088,149," day of doom, or night of drink?"
6089,149,
6090,149,"in the full, fresh fragrant morning"
6091,149," i observed a camel crawl,"
6092,149,"laws of gravitation scorning,"
6093,149, on the ceiling and the wall;
6094,149,"then i watched a fender walking,"
6095,149," and i heard grey leeches sing,"
6096,149,and a red-hot monkey talking
6097,149," did not seem the proper thing,"
6098,149,
6099,149,"then a creature, skinned and crimson,"
6100,149," ran about the floor and cried,"
6101,149,"and they said that i had the jims on,"
6102,149," and they dosed me with bromide,"
6103,149,and they locked me in my bedroom --
6104,149, me and one wee blood red mouse --
6105,149,"though i said, to give my head room"
6106,149," you had best unroof the house,"
6107,149,
6108,149,"but my words were all unheeded,"
6109,149," though i told the grave m,d,"
6110,149,that the treatment really needed
6111,149, was a dip in open sea
6112,149,"that was lapping just below me,"
6113,149," smooth as silver, white as snow,"
6114,149,and it took three men to throw me
6115,149," when i found i could not go,"
6116,149,
6117,149,half the night i watched the heavens
6118,149, fizz like '81 champagne --
6119,149,"fly to sixes and to sevens,"
6120,149, wheel and thunder back again;
6121,149,and when all was peace and order
6122,149," save one planet nailed askew,"
6123,149,much i wept because my warder
6124,149," would not let me sit it true,"
6125,149,
6126,149,"after frenzied hours of wating,"
6127,149," when the earth and skies were dumb,"
6128,149,pealed an awful voice dictating
6129,149," an interminable sum,"
6130,149,changing to a tangle story --
6131,149, what she said you said i said --
6132,149,"till the moon arose in glory,"
6133,149," and i found her , , , in my head;"
6134,149,
6135,149,"then a face came, blind and weeping,"
6136,149," and it couldn't wipe its eyes,"
6137,149,and it muttered i was keeping
6138,149, back the moonlight from the skies;
6139,149,"so i patted it for pity,"
6140,149," but it whistled shrill with wrath,"
6141,149,and a huge black devil city
6142,149," poured its peoples on my path,"
6143,149,
6144,149,so i fled with steps uncertain
6145,149," on a thousand-year long race,"
6146,149,but the bellying of the curtain
6147,149, kept me always in one place;
6148,149,while the tumult rose and maddened
6149,149," to the roar of earth on fire,"
6150,149,ere it ebbed and sank and saddened
6151,149," to a whisper tense as wire,"
6152,149,
6153,149,in tolerable stillness
6154,149," rose one little, little star,"
6155,149,"and it chuckled at my illness,"
6156,149, and it mocked me from afar;
6157,149,"and its breathren came and eyed me,"
6158,149," called the universe to aid,"
6159,149,"till i lay, with naught to hide me,"
6160,149," 'neath' the scorn of all things made,"
6161,149,
6162,149,"dun and saffron, robed and splendid,"
6163,149," broke the solemn, pitying day,"
6164,149,"and i knew my pains were ended,"
6165,149, and i turned and tried to pray;
6166,149,"but my speech was shattered wholly,"
6167,149," and i wept as children weep,"
6168,149,"till the dawn-wind, softly, slowly,"
6169,149," brought to burning eyelids sleep,"
6170,150,i turned -- heaven knows we women turn too much
6171,150,"to broken reeds, mistaken so for pine"
6172,150,that shame forbids confession -- a handle i turned
6173,150,"the wrong one, said the agent afterwards"
6174,150,and so flung clean across your english street
6175,150,"through the shrill-tinkling glass of the shop-front-paused,"
6176,150,"artemis mazed 'mid gauds to catch a man,"
6177,150,"and piteous baby-caps and christening-gowns,"
6178,150,"the worse for being worn on the radiator,"
6179,150,
6180,150,"my cousin romney judged me from the bench,"
6181,150,propounding one sleek forty-shillinged law
6182,150,"that takes no count of the woman's oversoul,"
6183,150,"i should have entered, purred he, by the door --"
6184,150,the man's retort -- the open obvious door --
6185,150,"and since i chose not, he -- not he -- could change"
6186,150,"the man's rule, not the woman's, for the case,"
6187,150,"ten pounds or seven days, just that, i paid!"
6188,151,"late came the god, having sent his forerunners who were"
6189,151,     not regarded--
6190,151," late, but in wrath;"
6191,151,"saying, the wrong shall be paid, the contempt be rewarded"
6192,151," on all that she hath,"
6193,151,"he poisoned the blade and struck home, the full bosom receiving"
6194,151,"the wound and the venom in one, past cure or relieving,"
6195,151,he made treaty with time to stand still that the grief might
6196,151,    be fresh--
6197,151,daily renewed and nightly pursued through her soul to her
6198,151,    flesh--
6199,151,"mornings of memory, noontides of agony, midnights unslaked"
6200,151,"    for her,"
6201,151,till the stones of the streets of her hells and her paradise ached
6202,151,"    for her,"
6203,151,
6204,151,"so she lived while her body corrupted upon her,"
6205,151," and she called on the night for a sign, and a sign was allowed,"
6206,151,and she builded an altar and served by the light of her vision--
6207,151," alone, without hope of regard or reward, but uncowed,"
6208,151,"resolute, selfless, divine,"
6209,151," these things she did in love's honour,"
6210,151,what is a god beside woman? dust and derision!
6211,152,"veil them, cover them, wall them round--"
6212,152,"       blossom, and creeper, and weed--"
6213,152,"   let us forget the sight and the sound,"
6214,152,       the smell and the touch of the breed!
6215,152,"   fat black ash by the altar-stone,"
6216,152,       here is the white-foot rain
6217,152,"   and the does bring forth in the fields unsown,"
6218,152,       and none shall affright them again;
6219,152,"   and the blind walls crumble, unknown, o'erthrown,"
6220,152,       and none shall inhabit again!
6221,153,smells are surer than sounds or sights
6222,153, to make your heart-strings crack--
6223,153,they start those awful voices o' nights
6224,153," that whisper,   old man, come back! "
6225,153,that must be why the big things pass
6226,153," and the little things remain,"
6227,153,"like the smell of the wattle by lichtenberg,"
6228,153,"  riding in, in the rain,"
6229,153,
6230,153,  there was some silly fire on the flank
6231,153,     and the small wet drizzling down--
6232,153,  there were the sold-out shops and the bank
6233,153,"     and the wet, wide-open town;"
6234,153,   and we were doing escort-duty
6235,153,"     to somebody's baggage-train,"
6236,153,   and i smelt wattle by lichtenberg--
6237,153,"      riding in, in the rain,"
6238,153,
6239,153,   it was all australia to me--
6240,153,"      all i had found or missed,"
6241,153,"    every face i was crazy to see,"
6242,153,"     and every woman i'd kissed,"
6243,153,"   all that i should n't ha' done, god knows!"
6244,153,"      as he knows i'll do it again,"
6245,153,"   that smell of the wattle round lichtenberg,"
6246,153,"      riding in, in the rain!"
6247,153,
6248,153,"   and i saw sydney the same as ever,"
6249,153,      the picnics and brass-bands;
6250,153,    and my little homestead on hunter river
6251,153,"      and my new vines joining hands,"
6252,153,    it all came over me in one act
6253,153,       quick as a shot through the brain--
6254,153,"     with the smell of the wattle round lichtenberg,"
6255,153,"        riding in, in the rain,"
6256,153,
6257,153,"      i have forgotten a hundred fights,"
6258,153,        but one i shall not forget--
6259,153,      with the raindrops bunging up my sights
6260,153,       and my eyes bunged up with wet;
6261,153,      and through the crack and the stink of the cordite
6262,153,         ah christ!   my country again!
6263,153,"      the smell of the wattle by lichtenberg,"
6264,153,"         riding in, in the rain!"
6265,154,"look, you have cast out love!  what gods are these"
6266,154,you bid me please?
6267,154,"the three in one, the one in three? not so!"
6268,154,"to my own gods i go,"
6269,154,it may be they shall give me greater ease

6347,156,
6348,156,he had touched their sword-hilts and greeted
6349,156,  with the old sure word of praise;
6350,156,and there was virtue in touch and speech
6351,156," as it had been in old days,"
6352,156,
6353,156,"so he dismissed them and took his rest,"
6354,156, and the steadfast spirit went forth

6372,157,"i met my mates in the morning and oh, but i am old!"
6373,157,where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;
6374,157,i heard them lift the chorus that dropped the breakers' song --
6375,157,the beaches of lukannon -- two million voices strong!
6376,157,
6377,157,"the song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,"
6378,157,"the song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,"
6379,157,the song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame --
6380,157,the beaches of lukannon -- before the sealers came!
6381,157,
6382,157,i met my mates in the morning i'll never meet them more!;

6385,157,"we hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach,"
6386,157,
6387,157,the beaches of lukannon -- the winter-wheat so tall --
6388,157,"the dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!"
6389,157,"the platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!"

6393,157,men shoot us in the water and club us on the land;

6785,164,and bears from shere would come and look
6786,164," for taffimai where shamley stands,"
6787,164,
6788,164,"the wey, that taffy called wagai,"
6789,164, was more than six times bigger then;
6790,164,and all the tribe of tegumai
6791,164, they cut a noble figure then!
6792,164,
6793,164,                    ii
6794,164,
6795,164,of all the tribe of tegumai
6796,164," who cut that figure, none remain,--"
6797,164,on merrow down the cuckoos cry--
6798,164," the silence and the sun remain,"
6799,164,
6800,164,but as the faithful years return
6801,164," and hearts unwounded sing again,"
6802,164,comes taffy dancing through the fern
6803,164,"  to lead the surrey spring again,"
6804,164,
6805,164,"her brows are bound with bracken-fronds,"
6806,164,  and golden elf-locks fly above;
6807,164,her eyes are bright as diamonds
6808,164,"  and bluer than the sky above,"
6809,164,
6810,164,"in moccasins and deer-skin cloak,"
6811,164,"   unfearing, free and fair she flits,"
6812,164,and lights her little damp-wood smoke
6813,164,"  to show her daddy where she flits,"
6814,164,
6815,164," for far--oh, very far behind,"
6816,164,"    so far she cannot call to him,"
6817,164, comes tegumai alone to find
6818,164,    the daughter that was all to him!
6819,165,"they shall not return to us, the resolute, the young,"
6820,165," the eager and whole-hearted whom we gave,"
6821,165,"but the men who left them thriftily to die in their own dung,"
6822,165, shall they come with years and honour to the grave?
6823,165,
6824,165,they shall not return to us; the strong men coldly slain
6825,165," in sight of help denied from day to day,"
6826,165,"but the men who edged their agonies and chid them in their pain,"
6827,165, are they too strong and wise to put away?
6828,165,
6829,165,our dead shall not return to us while day and night divide--
6830,165," never while the bars of sunset hold,"
6831,165,"but the idle-minded overlings who quibbled while they died,"
6832,165, shall they thrust for high employments as of old?
6833,165,
6834,165,"shall we only threaten and be angry for an hour,"
6835,165, when the storm is ended shall we find
6836,165,how softly but how swiftly they have sidled back to power
6837,165, by the favour and contrivance of their kind?
6838,165,
6839,165,"even while they soothe us, while they promise large amends,"
6840,165," even while they make a show of fear,"
6841,165,"do they call upon their debtors,  and  take  counsel  with  their"
6842,165,"    friends,"
6843,165, to conform and re-establish each career?
6844,165,
6845,165,their lives cannot repay us--their death could not undo--
6846,165," the shame that they have laid upon our race,"
6847,165,"but the slothfulness that wasted and the arrogance that slew,"
6848,165, shell we leave it unabated in its place?
6849,166,dawn off the foreland -- the young flood making
6850,166,jumbled and short and steep --
6851,166,black in the hollows and bright where it's breaking --
6852,166,"awkward water to sweep,"
6853,166,"mines reported in the fairway,"
6854,166,"warn all traffic and detain,"
6855,166,"sent up unity, claribel, assyrian, stormcock, and golden gain,"

6857,166,noon off the foreland -- the first ebb making
6858,166,"lumpy and strong in the bight,"
6859,166,"boom after boom, and the golf-hut shaking"
6860,166,"and the jackdaws wild with fright,"
6861,166,"mines located in the fairway,"
6862,166,"boats now working up the chain,"
6863,166,"sweepers -- unity, claribel, assyrian, stormcock, and golden gain,"
6864,166,
6865,166,dusk off the foreland -- the last light going
6866,166,"and the traffic crowding through,"
6867,166,and five damned trawlers with their syreens blowing
6868,166,heading the whole review!
6869,166,"sweep completed in the fairway,"
6870,166,"no more mines remain,"
6871,166,"sent back unity, claribel, assyrian, stormcock, and golden gain,"
6872,167,"if i were hanged on the highest hill,"
6873,167,"mother o' mine, o mother o' mine!"
6874,167,"i know whose love would follow me still,"

6893,169,"the song of mowgli -- i, mowgli, am singing, let"
6894,169,"     the jungle listen to the things i have done,"
6895,169,shere khan said he would kill -- would kill! at the
6896,169,"     gates in the twilight he would kill mowgli, the"
6897,169,     frog!
6898,169,"he ate and he drank, drink deep, shere khan, for"
6899,169,     when wilt thou drink again? sleep and dream
6900,169,"     of the kill,"
6901,169,"i am alone on the grazing-grounds, gray brother,"
6902,169,"     come to me! come to me, lone wolf, for there"
6903,169,"     is big game afoot,"
6904,169,"bring up the great bull-buffaloes, the blue-skinned"
6905,169,"     herd-bulls with the angry eyes, drive them to"
6906,169,"     and fro as i order,"
6907,169,"sleepest thou still, shere khan? wake, o wake!"
6908,169,"     here come i, and the bulls are behind,"
6909,169,"rama, the king of the buffaloes, stamped with his"
6910,169,"     foot, waters of the waingunga, whither went"
6911,169,     shere khan?
6912,169,"he is not ikki to dig holes, nor mao, the peacock, that"
6913,169,"     he should fly, he is not mang, the bat, to hang"
6914,169,"     in the branches, little bamboos that creak to-"
6915,169,"     gether, tell me where he ran?"
6916,169,"ow! he is there, ahoo! he is there, under the"
6917,169,"     feet of rama lies the lame one! up, shere"
6918,169,     khan! up and kill! here is meat; break the
6919,169,     necks of the bulls!
6920,169,"hsh! he is asleep, we will not wake him, for his"
6921,169,"     strength is very great, the kites have come down"
6922,169,"     to see it, the black ants have come up to know"
6923,169,"     it, there is a great assembly in his honour,"
6924,169,"alala! i have no cloth to wrap me, the kites will"
6925,169,"     see that i am naked, i am ashamed to meet all"
6926,169,"     these people,"
6927,169,"lend me thy coat, shere khan, lend me thy gay"
6928,169,"     striped coat that i may go to the council rock,"
6929,169,by the bull that bought me i have made a promise --
6930,169,"     a little promise, only thy coat is lacking before i"
6931,169,"     keep my word,"
6932,169,with the knife -- with the knife that men use -- with
6933,169,"     the knife of the hunter, the man, i will stoop down"
6934,169,"     for my gift,"
6935,169,"waters of the waingunga, bear witness that shere"
6936,169,     khan gives me his coat for the love that he bears
6937,169,"     me, pull, gray brother! pull, akela! heavy is"
6938,169,"     the hide of shere khan,"
6939,169,"the man pack are angry, they throw stones and talk"
6940,169,"     child's talk, my mouth is bleeding, let us run"
6941,169,"     away,"
6942,169,"through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly"
6943,169,"     with me, my brothers, we will leave the lights"
6944,169,"     of the village and go to the low moon,"
6945,169,"waters of the waingunga, the man pack have cast me"
6946,169,"     out, i did them no harm, but they were afraid of"
6947,169,"     me, why?"
6948,169,"wolf pack, ye have cast me out too, the jungle is"
6949,169,"     shut to me and the village gates are shut, why?"
6950,169,as mang flies between the beasts and the birds so fly
6951,169,"     i between the village and the jungle, why?"
6952,169,"i dance on the hide of shere khan, but my heart is"
6953,169,"     very heavy, my mouth is cut and wounded with"
6954,169,"     the stones from the village, but my heart is very"
6955,169,"     light because i have come back to the jungle,"
6956,169,     why?
6957,169,these two things fight together in me as the snakes
6958,169,"     fight in the spring, the water comes out of my"
6959,169,"     eyes; yet i laugh while it falls, why?"
6960,169,"i am two mowglis, but the hide of shere khan is under"
6961,169,"     my feet,"
6962,169,"all the jungle knows that i have killed shere khan,"
6963,169,"     look -- look well, o wolves!"
6964,169,ahae! my heart is heavy with the things that i do
6965,169,"     not understand,"
6966,169,
6967,169,"oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,"
6968,169,"     and black are the waters that sparkled so green,"
6969,169,"the moon, o'er the combers, looks downward to find us"
6970,169,"     at rest in the hollows that rustle between,"
6971,169,"where billow meets billow, there soft be thy pillow;"
6972,169,"     ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!"
6973,169,"the storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,"
6974,169,"     asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas,"
6975,170,i will let loose against you the fleet-footed vines--
6976,170,i will call in the jungle to stamp out your lines!
6977,170,"    the roofs shall fade before it,"
6978,170,      the house-beams shall  fall;
6979,170,"    and the karela, the bitter karela,"
6980,170,      shall cover it all!
6981,170,
6982,170,"in the gates of these your councils my people shall sing,"
6983,170,in the doors of these your garners the bat-folk shall cling;
6984,170,"    and the snake shall be your watchman,"
6985,170,      by a hearthstone unswept;
6986,170,"    for the karela, the bitter karela,"
6987,170,      shall fruit where ye slept!
6988,170,
6989,170,"ye shall not see my strikers; ye shall hear them and guess,"
6990,170,"by night, before the moon-rise, i will send for my cess,"
6991,170,    and the wolf shall be your herdsman
6992,170,      by a landmark removed;
6993,170,"    for the karela, the bitter karela,"
6994,170,      shall seed where ye loved!
6995,170,
6996,170,"i will reap your fields before you at the hands of a host,"
6997,170,ye shall glean behind my reapers for the bread that is lost;
6998,170,    and the deer shall be your oxen
6999,170,      on a headland untilled;
7000,170,"    for the karela, the bitter karela,"
7001,170,      shall leaf where ye build!
7002,170,
7003,170,i have untied against you the club-footed vines--
7004,170,i have sent in the jungle to swamp out your lines!
7005,170,    the trees--the trees are on you!
7006,170,      the house-beams shall fall;
7007,170,"    and the karela, the bitter karela,"
7008,170,      shall cover you all!
7009,171,"the fear was on the cattle, for the gale was on the sea,"
7010,171,an' the pens broke up on the lower deck an' let the creatures free --
7011,171,"an' the lights went out on the lower deck, an' no one near but me,"
7012,171,
7013,171,"i had been singin' to them to keep 'em quiet there,"
7014,171,"for the lower deck is the dangerousest, requirin' constant care,"
7015,171,"an' give to me as the strongest man, though used to drink and swear,"
7016,171,
7017,171,"i see my chance was certain of bein' horned or trod,"
7018,171,"for the lower deck was packed with steers thicker'n peas in a pod,"
7019,171,"an' more pens broke at every roll -- so i made a contract with god,"
7020,171,
7021,171,"an' by the terms of the contract, as i have read the same,"
7022,171,"if he got me to port alive i would exalt his name,"
7023,171,"an' praise his holy majesty till further orders came,"
7024,171,
7025,171,"he saved me from the cattle an' he saved me from the sea,"
7026,171,for they found me 'tween two drownded ones where the roll had landed me --
7027,171,"an' a four-inch crack on top of my head, as crazy as could be,"
7028,171,
7029,171,"but that were done by a stanchion, an' not by a bullock at all,"
7030,171,"an' i lay still for seven weeks convalessing of the fall,"
7031,171,"an' readin' the shiny scripture texts in the seaman's hospital,"
7032,171,
7033,171,"an' i spoke to god of our contract, an' he says to my prayer,"
7034,171,"i never puts on my ministers no more than they can bear,"
7035,171,"so back you go to the cattle-boats an' preach my gospel there,"
7036,171,
7037,171,"for human life is chancy at any kind of trade,"
7038,171,"but most of all, as well you know, when the steers are mad-afraid;"
7039,171,"so you go back to the cattle-boats an' preach 'em as i've said,"
7040,171,
7041,171,"they must quit drinkin' an' swearin', they mustn't knife on a blow,"
7042,171,"they must quit gamblin' their wages, and you must preach it so;"
7043,171,"for now those boats are more like hell than anything else i know,"
7044,171,
7045,171,"i didn't want to do it, for i knew what i should get,"
7046,171,"an' i wanted to preach religion, handsome an' out of the wet,"
7047,171,"but the word of the lord were lain on me, an' i done what i was set,"
7048,171,
7049,171,"i have been smit an' bruis]ed, as warned would be the case,"
7050,171,an' turned my cheek to the smiter exactly as scripture says;
7051,171,"but following that, i knocked him down an' led him up to grace,"
7052,171,
7053,171,"an' we have preaching on sundays whenever the sea is calm,"
7054,171,"an' i use no knife or pistol an' i never take no harm,"
7055,171,"for the lord abideth back of me to guide my fighting arm,"
7056,171,
7057,171,"an' i sign for four-pound-ten a month and save the money clear,"
7058,171,"an' i am in charge of the lower deck, an' i never lose a steer;"
7059,171,"an' i believe in almighty god an' preach his gospel here,"
7060,171,
7061,171,"the skippers say i'm crazy, but i can prove 'em wrong,"
7062,171,for i am in charge of the lower deck with all that doth belong --

7064,172,why is my district death-rate low?
7065,172," said binks of hezabad,"
7066,172,"well, drains, and sewage-outfalls are"
7067,172," my own peculiar fad,"
7068,172,"i learnt a lesson once, it ran"
7069,172,"thus, quoth that most veracious man, --"
7070,172,
7071,172,"it was an august evening and, in snowy garments clad,"
7072,172,i paid a round of visits in the lines of hezabad;
7073,172,"when, presently, my waler saw, and did not like at all,"
7074,172,"a commissariat elephant careering down the mall,"
7075,172,
7076,172,"i couldn't see he driver, and across my mind it rushed"
7077,172,"that that commissariat elephant had suddenly gone musth,"
7078,172,"i didn't care to meet him, and i couldn't well get down,"
7079,172,"so i let the waler have it, and we headed for the town,"
7080,172,
7081,172,"the buggy was a new one and, praise dykes, it stood the strain,"
7082,172,till he waler jumped a bullock just above the city drain;
7083,172,"and the next that i remember was a hurricane of squeals,"
7084,172,"and the creature making toothpicks of my five-foot patent wheels,"
7085,172,
7086,172,"he seemed to want the owner, so i fled, distraught with fear,"
7087,172,to the main drain sewage-outfall while he snorted in my ear --
7088,172,"reached the four-foot drain-head safely and, in darkness and despair,"
7089,172,"felt the brute's proboscis fingering my terror-stiffened hair,"
7090,172,
7091,172,heard it trumpet on my shoulder -- tried to crawl a little higher --
7092,172,"found the main drain sewage outfall blocked, some eight feet up, with mire;"
7093,172,"and, for twenty reeking minutes, sir, my very marrow froze,"
7094,172,while the trunk was feeling blindly for a purchase on my toes!
7095,172,
7096,172,"it missed me by a fraction, but my hair was turning grey"
7097,172,"before they called the drivers up and dragged the brute away,"
7098,172,"then i sought the city elders, and my words were very plain,"
7099,172,they flushed that four-foot drain-head and -- it never choked again!
7100,172,
7101,172,"you may hold with surface-drainage, and the sun-for-garbage cure,"
7102,172,"till you've been a periwinkle shrinking coyly up a sewer,"
7103,172,"i believe in well-flushed culverts, , , ,"
7104,172,                                 this is why the death-rate's small;
7105,172,"and, if you don't believe me, get shikarred yourself, that's all,"
7106,173,'have you news of my boy jack?'
7107,173,"not this tide,"
7108,173,'when d'you think that he'll come back?'
7109,173,"not with this wind blowing, and this tide,"
7110,173,'has anyone else had word of him?'
7111,173,"not this tide,"
7112,173,"for what is sunk will hardly swim,"
7113,173,"not with this wind blowing and this tide,"
7114,173,"'oh, dear, what comfort can i find?'"
7115,173,"none this tide,"
7116,173,"nor any tide,"
7117,173,except he did not shame his kind-
7118,173,"not even with that wind blowing, and that tide,"
7119,173,"then hold your head up all the more,"
7120,173,"this tide,"
7121,173,and every tide;
7122,173,"because he was the son you bore,"
7123,173,and gave to that wind blowing and that tide!
7124,174,there are four good legs to my father's chair--

7482,182,"white-haired, red-faced, who sat the plunging horse"
7483,182,"out in the garden, he's your right-hand man,"
7484,182,"and dreams of tilting w-ls-y from the throne,"
7485,182,but while he dreams gives work we cannot buy;
7486,182,he has his reputation -- wants the lords
7487,182,"by way of frontier roads, meantime, i think,"
7488,182,he values very much the hand that falls
7489,182,upon his shoulder at the council table --
7490,182,"hates cats and knows his business; which is yours,"
7491,182," your business! twice a hundred million souls,"
7492,182,your business! i could tell you what i did
7493,182,"some nights of eighty-five, at simla, worth"
7494,182,"a kingdom's ransom, when a big ship drives,"
7495,182,god knows to what new reef the man at the whee!
7496,182,"prays with the passengers, they lose their lives,"
7497,182,or rescued go their way; but he's no man
7498,182,to take his trick at the wheel again -- that's worse
7499,182,"than drowning, well, a galled mashobra mule"
7500,182,"you'll see mashobra passed me on the mall,"
7501,182,and i was -- some fool's wife and ducked and bowed
7502,182,"to show the others i would stop and speak,"
7503,182,"then the mule fell -- three galls, a hund-breadth each,"
7504,182,"behind the withers, mrs, whatsisname"
7505,182,"leers at the mule and me by turns, thweet thoul!"
7506,182,how could they make him carry such a load!
7507,182,i saw -- it isn't often i dream dreams --
7508,182,more than the mule that minute -- smoke and flame
7509,182,"from simla to the haze below, that's weak,"
7510,182,"you're younger, you'll dream dreams before you've done,"
7511,182,"you've youth, that's one -- good workmen -- that means two"
7512,182,"fair chances in your favor, fate's the third,"
7513,182,"i know what i did, do you ask me, preach?"
7514,182,i answer by my past or else go back
7515,182,to platitudes of rule -- or take you thus
7516,182,"in confidence and say, you know the trick,"
7517,182,"you've governed canada, you know, you know!"
7518,182,and all the while commend you to fate's hand
7519,182,"here at the top on loses sight o' god,"
7520,182,"commend you, then, to something more than you --"
7521,182,the other people's blunders and
7522,182," , , , that's all,"
7523,182,"i'd agonize to serve you if i could,"
7524,182,"it's incommunicable, like the cast"
7525,182,"that drops the tackle with the gut adry,"
7526,182,too much -- too little -- there's your salmon lost!
7527,182,"and so i tell you nothing --with you luck,"
7528,182,and wonder -- how i wonder! -- for your sake
7529,182,"and triumph for my own, you're young, you're young,"
7530,182,"you hold to half a hundred shibboleths,"
7531,182,"i'm old, i followed power to the last,"
7532,182,"gave her my best, and power followed me,"
7533,182,"it's worth it -- on my soul i'm speaking plain,"
7534,182,"here by the claret glasses! -- worth it all,"
7535,182,"i gave -- no matter what i gave -- i win,"
7536,182,"i know i win, mine's work, good work that lives!"
7537,182,a country twice the size of france -- the north
7538,182,"safeguarded, that's my record, sink the rest"
7539,182,"and better if you can, the rains may serve,"
7540,182,rupees may rise -- three pence will give you fame --
7541,182,it's rash to hope for sixpence -- if they rise
7542,182,"get guns, more guns, and lift the salt-tax,"
7543,182,oh!
7544,182,i told you what the congress meant or thought?
7545,182,"i'll answer nothing, half a year will prove"
7546,182,the full extent of time and thought you'll spare
7547,182,"to congress, ask a lady doctor once"
7548,182,how little begums see the light -- deduce
7549,182,"thence how the true reformer's child is born,"
7550,182,"it's interesting, curious , , , and vile,"
7551,182,"i told the turk he was a gentlman,"
7552,182,i told the russian that his tartar veins
7553,182,"bled pure parisian ichor; and he purred,"
7554,182,"the congress doesn't purr, i think it swears,"
7555,182,"you're young -- you'll swear to ere you've reached the end,"
7556,182,"the end! god help you, if there be a god,"
7557,182,there must be one to startle gl-dst-ne's soul
7558,182,"in that new land where all the wires are cut,"
7559,182,"and cr-ss snores anthems on the asphodel,"
7560,182,"god help you! and i'd help you if i could,"
7561,182,"but that's beyond me, yes, your speech was crude,"
7562,182,sound claret after olives -- yours and mine;
7563,182,"but medoc slips into vin ordinaire,"
7564,182,"i'll drink my first at genoa to your health,"
7565,182,"raise it to hock, you'll never catch my style,"
7566,182,"and, after all, the middle-classes grip"
7567,182,"the middle-class -- for brompton talk earl's court,"
7568,182,"perhaps you're right, i'll see you in the times --"
7569,182,"a quarter-column of eye-searing print,"
7570,182,a leader once a quarter -- then a war;
7571,182,"the strand abellow through the fog, defeat!"
7572,182,'orrible slaughter! while you lie awake
7573,182,"and wonder, oh, you'll wonder ere you're free!"
7574,182,"i wonder now, the four years slide away"
7575,182,"so fast, so fast, and leave me here alone,"
7576,182,"r-y, c-lv-n, l-l, r-b-rts, b-ck, the rest,"

7593,182,"more trains, more troops, more dust, and then all's done,"
7594,182,"four years, and i forget, if i forget"
7595,182,how will they bear me in their minds? the north
7596,182,"safeguarded -- nearly r-b-rts knows the rest,"
7597,182,"a country twice the size of france annexed,"

7599,182,"your heritage -- and i can teach you nought,"
7600,182,"high trust, vast honor, interests twice as vast,"

7947,189,"said england unto pharaoh, i must make a man of you,"
7948,189, that will stand upon his feet and play the game;
7949,189,"that will maxim his oppressor as a christian ought to do,"
7950,189," and she sent old pharaoh sergeant whatisname,"
7951,189,"   it was not a duke nor earl, nor yet a viscount --"
7952,189,     it was not a big brass general that came;
7953,189,"   but a man in khaki kit who could handle men a bit,"
7954,189,"     with his bedding labelled sergeant whatisname,"
7955,189,
7956,189,"said england unto pharaoh,  though at present singing small,"
7957,189," you shall hum a proper tune before it ends,"
7958,189,"and she introduced old pharaoh to the sergeant once for all,"
7959,189," and left 'em in the desert making friends,"
7960,189,   it was not a crystal palace nor cathedral;
7961,189,     it was not a public-house of common fame;
7962,189,"   but a piece of red-hot sand, with a palm on either hand,"
7963,189,"     and a little hut for sergeant whatisname,"
7964,189,
7965,189,"said england unto pharaoh, you 've had miracles before,"
7966,189, when aaron struck your rivers into blood;
7967,189,"but if you watch the sergeant he can show you something more,                                   '"
7968,189," he's a charm for making riflemen from mud,"
7969,189,"   it was neither hindustani, french, nor coptics;"
7970,189,"     it was odds and ends and leavings of the same,"
7971,189,"   translated by a stick which is really half the trick,"
7972,189,"     and pharaoh harked to sergeant whatisname,"
7973,189,
7974,189,there were y ears that no one talked of; there were times of horrid doubt --
7975,189, there was faith and hope and whacking and despair --
7976,189,"while the sergeant gave the cautions and he combed old pharaoh out,"
7977,189," and england didn't seem to know nor care,"
7978,189,   that is england's awful way o' doing business --
7979,189,     she would serve her god or gordon just the same --
7980,189,"   for she thinks her empire still is the strand and hol born hill,"
7981,189,"     and she didn't think of sergeant whatisname,"
7982,189,
7983,189,"said england to the sergeant, you can let my people go!"
7984,189,"  england used 'em cheap and nasty from the start,"
7985,189,and they entered 'em in battle on a most astonished foe --
7986,189,  but the sergeant he had hardened pharaoh's heart
7987,189,"    which was broke, along of all the plagues of egypt,"
7988,189,      three thousand years before the sergeant came
7989,189,"    and he mended it again in a little more than ten,"
7990,189,"      till pharaoh fought like sergeant whatisname,"
7991,189,
7992,189,"it was wicked bad campaigning cheap and nasty from the first,"
7993,189," there was heat and dust and coolie-work and sun,"
7994,189,"there were vipers; flies, and sandstorms, there was cholera and thirst,"
7995,189," but pharaoh done the best he ever done,"
7996,189,"   down the desert, down the railway, down the river,"
7997,189,"     like israelites from bondage so he came,"
7998,189,"   'tween the clouds o' dust and fire to the land of his desire,"
7999,189,"     and his moses, it was sergeant whatisname!"
8000,189,
8001,189,"we are eating dirt in handfuls for to save our daily bread,"
8002,189," which we have to buy from those that hate us most,"
8003,189,"and we must not raise the money where the sergeant raised the dead,"
8004,189," and it's wrong and bad and dangerous to boast,"
8005,189,"   but he did it on the cheap and on the quiet,"
8006,189,   and he's not allowed to forward any claim --
8007,189," though he drilled a black man white, though he made a mummy fight,"
8008,189,   he will still continue sergeant whatisname --
8009,189," private, corporal, colour-sergeant, and instructor --"
8010,189,   but the everlasting miracle's the same!

8012,190," you mustn't take my stories for a guide,"
8013,190,"there's little left, indeed, of the city you will read of,"

8108,193,
8109,193,"that is to say, in a casual way,"
8110,193, i slipped my arm around her;

8113,193,
8114,193,she turned her head and the name she said

8178,194,with half the king's navy
8179,194,blockading french ports against poor honest men!

8182,194,which is our salvation 
8183,194,so swiftly we stand to the nor'ard again;
8184,194,and finding the tail of
8185,194,"a homeward-bound convoy,    "
8186,194,"we slip past the scillies like poor honest men,"
8187,194,

8201,194,
8202,194,to be drowned or be shot

8676,210,but when his brother leaped the wall
8677,210," and mocked its height and make,"
8678,210,he guessed the future of it all
8679,210," and slew him for its sake,"
8680,210,
8681,210,swift was the blow--swift as the thought

9245,224,       will you never let us go?
9246,224,the solt made the oar-hands like shark-skin; our knees were
9247,224,    cut to the bone with salt-cracks; our hair was stuck to
9248,224,"    our foreheads; and our lips were cut to the gums, and you"
9249,224,"    whipped us because we could not row,"
9250,224,       will you never let us go?
9251,224,"but, in a little time, we shall run out of the port-holes as the water"
9252,224,"    runs along the oar-blade,  and though you tell the others"
9253,224,    to row after us you will never catch us till you catch the
9254,224,"    oar-thresh and tie up the winds in the belly of the sail,"
9255,224,    aho!
9256,224,       will you never let us go?
9257,225,i closed and drew for my love's sake
9258,225,"that now is false to me,"
9259,225,and i slew the reiver of tarrant moss
9260,225,"and set dumeny free,"
9261,225,
9262,225,"they have gone down, they have gone down,"
9263,225,they are standing all arow -
9264,225,"twenty knights in the peat-water,"
9265,225,that never struck a blow!
9266,225,
9267,225,"their armour shall not dull nor rust,"
9268,225,"their flesh shall not decay,"
9269,225,"for tarrant moss holds them in trust,"
9270,225,"until the judgment day,"
9271,225,
9272,225,"their soul went from them in their youth,"
9273,225,"ah god, that mine had gone,"
9274,225,whenas i leaned on my love's truth
9275,225,and not on my sword alone!
9276,225,
9277,225,whenas i leaned on lad's belief
9278,225,and not on my naked blade -
9279,225,"and i slew a thief, and an honest thief,"
9280,225,"for the sake of a worthless maid,"
9281,225,
9282,225,"they have laid the reiver low in his place,"
9283,225,"they have set me up on high,"
9284,225,but the twenty knights in the peat-water
9285,225,are luckier than i!
9286,225,
9287,225,and ever they give me gold and praise
9288,225,and ever i mourn my loss -
9289,225,for i struck the blow for my false love's sake
9290,225,and not for the men of the moss!
9291,226,it got beyond all orders an' it got beyond all 'ope;
9292,226,"it got to shammin' wounded an' retirin' from the 'alt,"
9293,226,'ole companies was lookin' for the nearest road to slope;
9294,226,it were just a bloomin' knock-out -- an' our fault!
9295,226,
9296,226,"    now there ain't no chorus 'ere to give,"
9297,226,      nor there ain't no band to play;
9298,226,"    an' i wish i was dead 'fore i done what i did,"
9299,226,      or seen what i seed that day!
9300,226,
9301,226,"we was sick o' bein' punished, an' we let 'em know it, too;"
9302,226,"an' a company-commander up an' 'it us with a sword,"
9303,226,"an' some one shouted 'ook it! an' it come to ~sove-ki-poo~,"
9304,226,an' we chucked our rifles from us -- o my gawd!
9305,226,
9306,226,there was thirty dead an' wounded on the ground we wouldn't keep --
9307,226,"no, there wasn't more than twenty when the front begun to go;"
9308,226,"but, christ! along the line o' flight they cut us up like sheep,"
9309,226,"an' that was all we gained by doin' so,"
9310,226,
9311,226,"i 'eard the knives be'ind me, but i dursn't face my man,"
9312,226,"nor i don't know where i went to, 'cause i didn't 'alt to see,"
9313,226,"till i 'eard a beggar squealin' out for quarter as 'e ran,"
9314,226,an' i thought i knew the voice an' -- it was me!
9315,226,
9316,226,we was 'idin' under bedsteads more than 'arf a march away;
9317,226,we was lyin' up like rabbits all about the countryside;
9318,226,"an' the major cursed 'is maker 'cause 'e lived to see that day,"
9319,226,"an' the colonel broke 'is sword acrost, an' cried,"
9320,226,
9321,226,we was rotten 'fore we started -- we was never disci~plined~;
9322,226,we made it out a favour if an order was obeyed;
9323,226,"yes, every little drummer 'ad 'is rights an' wrongs to mind,"
9324,226,so we had to pay for teachin' -- an' we paid!
9325,226,
9326,226,"the papers 'id it 'andsome, but you know the army knows;"
9327,226,"we was put to groomin' camels till the regiments withdrew,"
9328,226,"an' they gave us each a medal for subduin' england's foes,"
9329,226,an' i 'ope you like my song -- because it's true!
9330,226,
9331,226,"    an' there ain't no chorus 'ere to give,"
9332,226,      nor there ain't no band to play;
9333,226,"    but i wish i was dead 'fore i done what i did,"
9334,226,      or seen what i seed that day!
9335,227,i've paid for your sickest fancies; i've humoured your crackedest whim --
9336,227,"dick, it's your daddy, dying; you've got to listen to him!"
9337,227,"good for a fortnight, am i?  the doctor told you?  he lied,"
9338,227,"i shall go under by morning, and --  put that nurse outside,"
9339,227,"'never seen death yet, dickie?  well, now is your time to learn,"
9340,227,"and you'll wish you held my record before it comes to your turn,"
9341,227,"not counting the line and the foundry, the yards and the village, too,"
9342,227,"i've made myself and a million; but i'm damned if i made you,"
9343,227,"master at two-and-twenty, and married at twenty-three --"
9344,227,"ten thousand men on the pay-roll, and forty freighters at sea!"
9345,227,"fifty years between 'em, and every year of it fight,"
9346,227,"and now i'm sir anthony gloster, dying, a baronite,"
9347,227,for i lunched with his royal 'ighness -- what was it the papers a-had?
9348,227,"not least of our merchant-princes,  dickie, that's me, your dad!"
9349,227,"~i~ didn't begin with askings,  ~i~ took my job and i stuck;"
9350,227,"and i took the chances they wouldn't, an' now they're calling it luck,"
9351,227,"lord, what boats i've handled -- rotten and leaky and old!"
9352,227,"ran 'em, or -- opened the bilge-cock, precisely as i was told,"
9353,227,"grub that 'ud bind you crazy, and crews that 'ud turn you grey,"
9354,227,"and a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way,"
9355,227,the others they dursn't do it; they said they valued their life
9356,227,"they've served me since as skippers,  ~i~ went, and i took my wife,"
9357,227,"over the world i drove 'em, married at twenty-three,"
9358,227,"and your mother saving the money and making a man of me,"
9359,227,"~i~ was content to be master, but she said there was better behind;"
9360,227,"she took the chances i wouldn't, and i followed your mother blind,"
9361,227,"she egged me to borrow the money, an' she helped me to clear the loan,"
9362,227,"when we bought half shares in a cheap 'un and hoisted a flag of our own,"
9363,227,"patching and coaling on credit, and living the lord knew how,"
9364,227,"we started the red ox freighters -- we've eight-and-thirty now,"
9365,227,"and those were the days of clippers, and the freights were clipper-freights,"
9366,227,"and we knew we were making our fortune, but she died in macassar straits --"
9367,227,"by the little paternosters, as you come to the union bank --"
9368,227,"and we dropped her in fourteen fathom; i pricked it off where she sank,"
9369,227,"owners we were, full owners, and the boat was christened for her,"
9370,227,"and she died in the ~mary gloster~,  my heart, how young we were!"
9371,227,"so i went on a spree round java and well-nigh ran her ashore,"
9372,227,"but your mother came and warned me and i wouldn't liquor no more,"
9373,227,"strict i stuck to my business, afraid to stop or i'd think,"
9374,227,"saving the money she warned me, and letting the other men drink,"
9375,227,"and i met m'cullough in london i'd turned five 'undred then,"
9376,227,"and 'tween us we started the foundry -- three forges and twenty men,"
9377,227,"cheap repairs for the cheap 'uns,  it paid, and the business grew,"
9378,227,"for i bought me a steam-lathe patent, and that was a gold mine too,"
9379,227,"cheaper to build 'em than buy 'em, ~i~ said, but m'cullough he shied,"
9380,227,"and we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the clyde,"
9381,227,"and the lines were all beginning, and we all of us started fair,"
9382,227,"building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square,"
9383,227,"but m'cullough 'e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all,"
9384,227,"and brussels an' utrecht velvet, and baths and a social hall,"
9385,227,"and pipes for closets all over, and cutting the frames too light,"
9386,227,"but m'cullough he died in the sixties, and --  well, i'm dying to-night, , , ,"
9387,227,"i knew -- ~i~ knew what was coming, when we bid on the ~byfleet~'s keel --"
9388,227,"they piddled and piffled with iron,  i'd given my orders for steel!"
9389,227,"steel and the first expansions,  it paid, i tell you, it paid,"
9390,227,when we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run trade!
9391,227,"and they asked me how i did it, and i gave 'em the scripture text,"
9392,227,you keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!
9393,227,"they copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,"
9394,227,"and i left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind,"
9395,227,"then came the armour-contracts, but that was m'cullough's side;"
9396,227,"he was always best in the foundry, but better, perhaps, he died,"
9397,227,i went through his private papers; the notes was plainer than print;
9398,227,"and i'm no fool to finish if a man'll give me a hint,"
9399,227,"i remember his widow was angry,  so i saw what the drawings meant,"
9400,227,"and i started the six-inch rollers, and it paid me sixty per cent --"
9401,227,"sixty per cent ~with~ failures, and more than twice we could do,"
9402,227,"and a quarter-million to credit, and i saved it all for you!"
9403,227,"i thought -- it doesn't matter -- you seemed to favour your ma,"
9404,227,"but you're nearer forty than thirty, and i know the kind you are,"
9405,227,harrer an' trinity college!  i ought to ha' sent you to sea --
9406,227,"but i stood you an education, an' what have you done for me?"
9407,227,"the things i knew was proper you wouldn't thank me to give,"
9408,227,"and the things i knew was rotten you said was the way to live,"
9409,227,"for you muddled with books and pictures, an' china an' etchin's an' fans,"
9410,227,and your rooms at college was beastly -- more like a whore's than a man's --
9411,227,"till you married that thin-flanked woman, as white and as stale as a bone,"
9412,227,an' she gave you your social nonsense; but where's that kid o' your own?
9413,227,"i've seen your carriages blocking the half o' the cromwell road,"
9414,227,"but never the doctor's brougham to help the missus unload,"
9415,227,"so there isn't even a grandchild, an' the gloster family's done,"
9416,227,"not like your mother, she isn't,  ~she~ carried her freight each run,"
9417,227,"but they died, the pore little beggars!  at sea she had 'em -- they died,"
9418,227,"only you, an' you stood it; you haven't stood much beside,"
9419,227,"weak, a liar, and idle, and mean as a collier's whelp"
9420,227,"nosing for scraps in the galley,  no help -- my son was no help!"
9421,227,"so he gets three 'undred thousand, in trust and the interest paid,"
9422,227,"i wouldn't give it you, dickie -- you see, i made it in trade,"
9423,227,"you're saved from soiling your fingers, and if you have no child,"
9424,227,"it all comes back to the business,  gad, won't your wife be wild!"
9425,227,"'calls and calls in her carriage, her 'andkerchief up to 'er eye,"
9426,227,"daddy! dear daddy's dyin'! and doing her best to cry,"
9427,227,"grateful?  oh, yes, i'm grateful, but keep her away from here,"
9428,227,"your mother 'ud never ha' stood 'er, and, anyhow, women are queer, , , ,"
9429,227,"there's women will say i've married a second time,"
9430,227,"not quite!  but give pore aggie a hundred, and tell her your lawyers'll fight,"
9431,227,she was the best o' the boiling -- you'll meet her before it ends;
9432,227,"i'm in for a row with the mother -- i'll leave you settle my friends,"
9433,227,"for a man he must go with a woman, which women don't understand --"
9434,227,"or the sort that say they can see it they aren't the marrying brand,"
9435,227,but i wanted to speak o' your mother that's lady gloster still --
9436,227,"i'm going to up and see her, without it's hurting the will,"
9437,227,"here!  take your hand off the bell-pull,  five thousand's waiting for you,"
9438,227,"if you'll only listen a minute, and do as i bid you do,"
9439,227,"they'll try to prove me crazy, and, if you bungle, they can;"
9440,227,"and i've only you to trust to!  o god, why ain't he a man?"
9441,227,"there's some waste money on marbles, the same as m'cullough tried --"
9442,227,"marbles and mausoleums -- but i call that sinful pride,"
9443,227,"there's some ship bodies for burial -- we've carried 'em, soldered and packed;"
9444,227,"down in their wills they wrote it, and nobody called ~them~ cracked,"
9445,227,"but me -- i've too much money, and people might, , , ,  all my fault,"
9446,227,"it come o' hoping for grandsons and buying that wokin' vault,"
9447,227,"i'm sick o' the 'ole dam' business; i'm going back where i came,"
9448,227,"dick, you're the son o' my body, and you'll take charge o' the same!"
9449,227,"i want to lie by your mother, ten thousand mile away,"
9450,227,"and they'll want to send me to woking; and that's where you'll earn your pay,"
9451,227,"i've thought it out on the quiet, the same as it ought to be done --"
9452,227,"quiet, and decent, and proper -- an' here's your orders, my son,"
9453,227,"you know the line?  you don't, though,  you write to the board, and tell"
9454,227,"your father's death has upset you an' you're goin' to cruise for a spell,"
9455,227,an' you'd like the ~mary gloster~ -- i've held her ready for this --
9456,227,"they'll put her in working order and you'll take her out as she is,"
9457,227,"yes, it was money idle when i patched her and put her aside"
9458,227,"thank god, i can pay for my fancies! -- the boat where your mother died,"
9459,227,"by the little paternosters, as you come to the union bank,"
9460,227,we dropped her -- i think i told you -- and i pricked it off where she sank --
9461,227,"['tiny she looked on the grating -- that oily, treacly sea --]"
9462,227,"'hundred and eighteen east, remember, and south just three,"
9463,227,easy bearings to carry -- three south -- three to the dot;
9464,227,"but i gave m'andrew a copy in case of dying -- or not,"
9465,227,"and so you'll write to m'andrew, he's chief of the maori line;"
9466,227,"they'll give him leave, if you ask 'em and say it's business o' mine,"
9467,227,"i built three boats for the maoris, an' very well pleased they were,"
9468,227,"an' i've known mac since the fifties, and mac knew me -- and her,"
9469,227,after the first stroke warned me i sent him the money to keep
9470,227,"against the time you'd claim it, committin' your dad to the deep;"
9471,227,"for you are the son o' my body, and mac was my oldest friend,"
9472,227,"i've never asked 'im to dinner, but he'll see it out to the end,"
9473,227,"stiff-necked glasgow beggar, i've heard he's prayed for my soul,"
9474,227,"but he couldn't lie if you paid him, and he'd starve before he stole!"
9475,227,he'll take the ~mary~ in ballast -- you'll find her a lively ship;
9476,227,"and you'll take sir anthony gloster, that goes on 'is wedding-trip,"
9477,227,"lashed in our old deck-cabin with all three port-holes wide,"
9478,227,the kick o' the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside!
9479,227,sir anthony gloster's carriage -- our 'ouse-flag flyin' free --
9480,227,ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea!
9481,227,"he made himself and a million, but this world is a fleetin' show,"
9482,227,and he'll go to the wife of 'is bosom the same as he ought to go --
9483,227,by the heel of the paternosters -- there isn't a chance to mistake --
9484,227,and mac'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break!
9485,227,"five thousand for six weeks' cruising, the staunchest freighter afloat,"
9486,227,and mac he'll give you your bonus the minute i'm out o' the boat!
9487,227,"he'll take you round to macassar, and you'll come back alone;"
9488,227,"he knows what i want o' the ~mary~, , , ,  i'll do what i please with my own,"
9489,227,"your mother 'ud call it wasteful, but i've seven-and-thirty more;"
9490,227,"i'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door, , , ,"
9491,227,"for my son 'e was never a credit,  'e muddled with books and art,"
9492,227,"and 'e lived on sir anthony's money and 'e broke sir anthony's heart,"
9493,227,"there isn't even a grandchild, and the gloster family's done --"
9494,227,"the only one you left me, o mother, the only one!"
9495,227,harrer and trinity college -- me slavin' early an' late --
9496,227,"an' he thinks i'm dying crazy, and you're in macassar strait!"
9497,227,"flesh o' my flesh, my dearie, for ever an' ever amen,"
9498,227,"that first stroke come for a warning; i ought to ha' gone to you then,"
9499,227,"but -- cheap repairs for a cheap 'un -- the doctors said i'd do,"
9500,227,"mary, why didn't ~you~ warn me?  i've allus heeded to you,"
9501,227,excep' -- i know -- about women; but you are a spirit now;
9502,227,"an', wife, they was only women, and i was a man,  that's how,"
9503,227,"an' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you could not understand;"
9504,227,"but i never talked 'em secrets,  i paid 'em out o' hand,"
9505,227,"thank gawd, i can pay for my fancies!  now what's five thousand to me,"
9506,227,for a berth off the paternosters in the haven where i would be?
9507,227,"~i~ believe in the resurrection, if i read my bible plain,"
9508,227,"but i wouldn't trust 'em at wokin'; we're safer at sea again,"
9509,227,"for the heart it shall go with the treasure -- go down to the sea in ships,"
9510,227,i'm sick of the hired women -- i'll kiss my girl on her lips!
9511,227,"i'll be content with my fountain, i'll drink from my own well,"
9512,227,and the wife of my youth shall charm me -- an' the rest can go to hell!
9513,227,"dickie, ~he~ will, that's certain,  i'll lie in our standin'-bed,"
9514,227,"an' mac'll take her in ballast -- an' she trims best by the head, , , ,"
9515,227,"down by the head an' sinkin', her fires are drawn and cold,"
9516,227,and the water's splashin' hollow on the skin of the empty hold --
9517,227,"churning an' choking and chuckling, quiet and scummy and dark --"
9518,227,"full to her lower hatches and risin' steady,  hark!"
9519,227,"that was the after-bulkhead, , , ,  she's flooded from stem to stern, , , ,"
9520,227,"never seen death yet, dickie? , , ,  well, now is your time to learn!"
9521,228,the 'eathen in 'is blindness bows down to wood an' stone;

9736,232,"a rose, in tatters on the garden path,"

9740,232,"and god, who hears both sun-dried dust and sun,"
9741,232,"had pity, whispering to that luckless one,"
9742,232,"sister, in that thou sayest we did not well --"
9743,232,what voices heardst thou when thy petals fell?
9744,232,"and the rose answered, in that evil hour"

9782,235,this is the ballad of ahmed shah
9783,235,"dealer in tats in the sudder bazar,"
9784,235,by the gate that leads to the gold minar
9785,235,"how he was done by a youth from morar,"
9786,235,
9787,235,ahmed shah was a man of peace -
9788,235,"his beard and turban were thick with grease,"
9789,235,his paunch was huge and his speech was slow
9790,235,"and he swindled the subalterns high and low,"
9791,235,scores of subalterns came to try
9792,235,"the tats that he sold - and remained to buy,"
9793,235,scores of subalterns later on
9794,235,found that their flashiest mounts were 'gone' -
9795,235,some in the front and some behind
9796,235,some were roarers and some went blind -
9797,235,scores of subalterns over their 'weeds'
9798,235,"cursed old ahmed and all his deeds,"
9799,235,but ahmed shah in his gully sat still -
9800,235,and ever he fashioned a little black pill!
9801,235,
9802,235,"yet a judgement was brewing for ahmed shah,"
9803,235,"like a witches cauldron, in far morar"
9804,235,and the youth that brewed it has eyes of blue
9805,235,"and his cheek was beardless and boundless too,"
9806,235,"softly he mused o'er a trichi thick,-"
9807,235,'by the beard of the prophet i've got the trick!'
9808,235,then he rose from his chair with an artless grin
9809,235,"and called the battery sergeant in,-"
9810,235,'sergeant' he said 'hasst aught for me
9811,235,in the way of a caster with lots of gee ?'
9812,235,the sergeant pondered and answered slow
9813,235,'there's a red-roan gelding that's bound to go
9814,235,"at the next committee, 'e ain't no use"
9815,235,"excep' for kickin' recruits to the deuce,"
9816,235,"'e's chained in the sick lines,'"
9817,235,the subaltern's brow
9818,235,"was puckered with thought for a moment, then"
9819,235,"the sergeant was richer by rupees ten,"
9820,235,'when the next committee sits' quoth he
9821,235,"'o sergeant buy up that brute for me,'"
9822,235,
9823,235,so the plot was laid and the long weeks passed
9824,235,"and the red-road gelding was duly cast,"
9825,235,they led him in chains to the subaltern's stall
9826,235,"and gave him his gram' through a hole in the wall,"
9827,235,"the subaltern mixed it, when morning came"
9828,235,"the red-road gelding was strangely tame,"
9829,235,he bit not nor kicked nor essayed to slay
9830,235,and he and the sub went north that day
9831,235,till they came to the gully of ahmed shah
9832,235,"the man and the horse from far morar,"
9833,235,the subaltern stated his funds were low
9834,235,"and he came - mehrbani - to 'sell karo',"
9835,235,then ahmed shah with his eyes agog
9836,235,"broke the tenth command in the decalogue,"
9837,235,for the roan was a monster in size and thews
9838,235,"and stood over sixteen hand in his shoes,"
9839,235,'sahib kitna mangta?' with brow serene
9840,235,"the subaltern softly answered 'teen',"
9841,235,"he haggled an hour, that dealer thrifty"
9842,235,till the price was lowered to do sow fifty
9843,235,and the money was paid in greasy rupees
9844,235,"while the red-roan gelding drowsed at his ease,"
9845,235,the subaltern left him - and ahmed smiled -
9846,235,"'by allah, how mad is this pink-faced child"
9847,235,i will stuff that ghorah with attah and goor
9848,235,and sell him again to some english soor
9849,235,"for a clear eight-fifty! , and e'en as he spoke"
9850,235,the devil they'd drugged in the red-roan woke !
9851,235,then the head-ropes snapped and the heel-ropes drew
9852,235,and the stallions squealed as the roan went through
9853,235,and the syces ran as men run for life
9854,235,and the yard was troubled with equine strife
9855,235,till the berserk-rage of the beat was o'er
9856,235,and he dropped to slumber at ahmed's door!
9857,235,
9858,235,then a veil was lifted from ahmed's eyes
9859,235,and he raised the eyelids and punched the thighs
9860,235,felt the tense pulse slacken - the muscles still -
9861,235,and fathomed the trcik of the opium pill!
9862,235,his own old dodge that had brought him pelf
9863,235,had the subaltern turned against himself!
9864,235,
9865,235,"did he swear, though his three best tats were lame"
9866,235,and half of the city would hear of his shame ?
9867,235,did he seek the law courts? with downcast eye
9868,235,"he hailed an ekka that jingled by,"
9869,235,"and drove to the station, where filled with peace"
9870,235,"the subaltern counted the greasy rupees,"
9871,235,
9872,235,"what passed between them? i cannot say,"

9895,236,"was stiff with bullion, but stiffer with gore,"

9922,236,"who went to their death with a joke in their teeth,"
9923,236,
9924,236,"and worshipped with fluency, fervour, and zeal"

9937,236,a rush through the mist -- a scattering fight --
9938,236,
9939,236,a volley from cover -- a corpse in the clearing --
9940,236,the glimpse of a loin-cloth and heavy jade earring --
9941,236,
9942,236,the flare of a village -- the tally of slain --

9971,236,
9972,236,and captain o'neil of the black tyrone
9973,236,was blessed with a slug in the ulnar-bone --

9975,236,
9976,236,now a slug that is hammered from telegraph-wire

10011,236,"and in far simoorie had taken a wife,"
10012,236,
10013,236,"and she was a damsel of delicate mould,"
10014,236,"with hair like the sunshine and heart of gold,"
10015,236,
10016,236,and little she knew the arms that embraced
10017,236,"had cloven a man from the brow to the waist,"
10018,236,
10019,236,and little she knew that the loving lips
10020,236,"had ordered a quivering life's eclipse,"
10021,236,
10022,236,and the eye that lit at her lightest breath
10023,236,"had glared unawed in the gates of death,"

10026,236,"as a general rule, from an innocent bride,"
10027,236,

10036,236,"speckless and spotless and shining with ~ghee~,"
10037,236,"in the rearmost cart sat the babu-jee,"
10038,236,
10039,236,and ever a phantom before him fled
10040,236,"of a scowling boh with a silver head,"
10041,236,
10042,236,"then the lead-cart stuck, though the coolies slaved,"
10043,236,and the cartmen flogged and the escort raved;

10046,236,"pranced boh da thone, and his gang at his heels!"

10050,236,
10051,236,and the blithe revolver began to sing
10052,236,"to the blade that twanged on the locking-ring,"
10053,236,
10054,236,"and the brown flesh blued where the bay'net kissed,"
10055,236,"as the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist,"
10056,236,
10057,236,and the great white bullocks with onyx eyes
10058,236,"watched the souls of the dead arise,"

10067,236,"and girded his ponderous loins for flight,"

10070,236,"on a lone-hand raid of the rearmost cart,"
10071,236,
10072,236,"and out of that cart, with a bellow of woe,"

10079,236,"on the broad of the chest of this best of bohs,"

10252,237,"up and down and back we went, never time for breath;"
10253,237,"then the money paid at lloyds' caught her by the heel,"
10254,237,and the stars ran round and round dancin' at our death!
10255,237,"   aching for an hour's sleep, dozing off between;"
10256,237,   'heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green;
10257,237,   'watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play --
10258,237,"   that was on the bolivar, south across the bay!"
10259,237,
10260,237,"once we saw between the squalls, lyin' head to swell --"
10261,237,"mad with work and weariness, wishin' they was we --"
10262,237,some damned liner's lights go by like a grand hotel;
10263,237,"cheered her from the bolivar swampin' in the sea,"
10264,237,"   then a greybeard cleared us out, then the skipper laughed;"
10265,237,"   boys, the wheel has gone to hell -- rig the winches aft!"
10266,237,   yoke the kicking rudder-head -- get her under way!
10267,237,"   so we steered her, pully-haul, out across the bay!"
10268,237,
10269,237,"just a pack o' rotten plates puttied up with tar,"
10270,237,"in we came, an' time enough, 'cross bilbao bar,"
10271,237,"   overloaded, undermanned, meant to founder, we"
10272,237,"   euchred god almighty's storm, bluffed the eternal sea!"
10273,237,
10274,237,"seven men from all the world back to town again,"
10275,237,"rollin' down the ratcliffe road drunk and raising cain,"
10276,237,"seven men from out of hell,  ain't the owners gay,"
10277,237,'cause we took the bolivar safe across the bay?
10278,238,"oh, east is east, and west is west, and never the twain shall meet,"
10279,238,    till earth and sky stand presently at god's great judgment seat;
10280,238,"    but there is neither east nor west, border, nor breed, nor birth,"
10281,238,"    when two strong men stand face to face,"
10282,238,      tho' they come from the ends of the earth!
10283,238,
10284,238,"kamal is out with twenty men to raise the border-side,"
10285,238,"and he has lifted the colonel's mare that is the colonel's pride,"
10286,238,"he has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,"
10287,238,"and turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away,"
10288,238,"then up and spoke the colonel's son that led a troop of the guides,"
10289,238,is there never a man of all my men can say where kamal hides?
10290,238,"then up and spoke mahommed khan, the son of the ressaldar,"
10291,238,"if ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know where his pickets are,"
10292,238,"at dusk he harries the abazai -- at dawn he is into bonair,"
10293,238,"but he must go by fort bukloh to his own place to fare,"
10294,238,"so if ye gallop to fort bukloh as fast as a bird can fly,"
10295,238,"by the favour of god ye may cut him off ere he win to the tongue of jagai,"
10296,238,"but if he be past the tongue of jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,"
10297,238,"for the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with kamal's men,"
10298,238,"there is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,"
10299,238,"and ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen,"
10300,238,"the colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,"
10301,238,with the mouth of a bell and the heart of hell
10302,238,"  and the head of the gallows-tree,"
10303,238,"the colonel's son to the fort has won, they bid him stay to eat --"
10304,238,"who rides at the tail of a border thief, he sits not long at his meat,"
10305,238,"he's up and away from fort bukloh as fast as he can fly,"
10306,238,"till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the tongue of jagai,"
10307,238,"till he was aware of his father's mare with kamal upon her back,"
10308,238,"and when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack,"
10309,238,"he has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide,"
10310,238,"ye shoot like a soldier, kamal said,  show now if ye can ride,"
10311,238,"it's up and over the tongue of jagai, as blown dustdevils go,"
10312,238,"the dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe,"
10313,238,"the dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,"
10314,238,"but the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove,"
10315,238,"there was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,"
10316,238,"and thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen,"
10317,238,"they have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,"
10318,238,"the dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn,"
10319,238,"the dun he fell at a water-course -- in a woful heap fell he,"
10320,238,"and kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free,"
10321,238,"he has knocked the pistol out of his hand -- small room was there to strive,"
10322,238,"'twas only by favour of mine, quoth he, ye rode so long alive,"
10323,238,"there was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,"
10324,238,"but covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee,"
10325,238,"if i had raised my bridle-hand, as i have held it low,"
10326,238,"the little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row,"
10327,238,"if i had bowed my head on my breast, as i have held it high,"
10328,238,"the kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly,"
10329,238,"lightly answered the colonel's son,  do good to bird and beast,"
10330,238,"but count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast,"
10331,238,"if there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,"
10332,238,"belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay,"
10333,238,"they will feed their horse on the standing crop,"
10334,238,"  their men on the garnered grain,"
10335,238,"the thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain,"
10336,238,"but if thou thinkest the price be fair, -- thy brethren wait to sup,"
10337,238,"the hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, -- howl, dog, and call them up!"
10338,238,"and if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,"
10339,238,"give me my father's mare again, and i'll fight my own way back!"
10340,238,"kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet,"
10341,238,"no talk shall be of dogs, said he, when wolf and gray wolf meet,"
10342,238,may i eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;
10343,238,what dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with death?
10344,238,"lightly answered the colonel's son,  i hold by the blood of my clan,"
10345,238,"take up the mare for my father's gift -- by god, she has carried a man!"
10346,238,"the red mare ran to the colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast;"
10347,238,"we be two strong men, said kamal then, but she loveth the younger best,"
10348,238,"so she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded rein,"
10349,238,"my broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain,"
10350,238,"the colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,"
10351,238,"ye have taken the one from a foe, said he;"
10352,238,  will ye take the mate from a friend?
10353,238,"a gift for a gift, said kamal straight; a limb for the risk of a limb,"
10354,238,"thy father has sent his son to me, i'll send my son to him!"
10355,238,"with that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest --"
10356,238,"he trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest,"
10357,238,"now here is thy master, kamal said, who leads a troop of the guides,"
10358,238,"and thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides,"
10359,238,"till death or i cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,"
10360,238,"thy life is his -- thy fate it is to guard him with thy head,"
10361,238,"so, thou must eat the white queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,"
10362,238,"and thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the border-line,"
10363,238,and thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power --
10364,238,"belike they will raise thee to ressaldar when i am hanged in peshawur,"
10365,238,
10366,238,"they have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault,"
10367,238,"they have taken the oath of the brother-in-blood on leavened bread and salt,"
10368,238,"they have taken the oath of the brother-in-blood on fire and fresh-cut sod,"
10369,238,"on the hilt and the haft of the khyber knife, and the wondrous names of god,"
10370,238,"the colonel's son he rides the mare and kamal's boy the dun,"
10371,238,"and two have come back to fort bukloh where there went forth but one,"
10372,238,"and when they drew to the quarter-guard, full twenty swords flew clear --"
10373,238,"there was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer,"
10374,238,"ha' done! ha' done! said the colonel's son,"
10375,238,  put up the steel at your sides!
10376,238,last night ye had struck at a border thief --
10377,238,  to-night 'tis a man of the guides!
10378,238,
10379,238,"    oh, east is east, and west is west, and never the twain shall meet,"
10380,238,    till earth and sky stand presently at god's great judgment seat;
10381,238,"    but there is neither east nor west, border, nor breed, nor birth,"
10382,238,"    when two strong men stand face to face,"
10383,238,      tho' they come from the ends of the earth!
10384,239,about the time that taverns shut
10385,239," and men can buy no beer,"
10386,239,two lads went up to the keepers' hut
10387,239," to steal lord pelham's deer,"
10388,239,
10389,239,night and the liquor was in their heads--
10390,239," they laughed and talked no bounds,"
10391,239,till they waked the keepers on their beds
10392,239," and the keepers loosed the hounds,"
10393,239,
10394,239,"they had killed a hart, they had killed a hind,"
10395,239," ready to carry away,"
10396,239,when they heard a whimper down the wind
10397,239," and they heard a bloodhound bay,"
10398,239,
10399,239,"they took and ran across the fern,"
10400,239," their crossbows in their hand,"
10401,239,till they met a man with a green lantern
10402,239," that called and bade 'em stand,"
10403,239,
10404,239,"what are ye doing, o flesh and blood,"
10405,239," and what's your foolish will,"
10406,239,that you must break into minepit wood
10407,239, and wake the folk of the hill?
10408,239,
10409,239,"oh, we've broke into lord pelham's park,"
10410,239," and killed lord pelham's deer,"
10411,239,and if ever you heard a little dog bark
10412,239," you'll know why we come here,"
10413,239,
10414,239,"we ask you let us go our way,"
10415,239," as fast as we can flee,"
10416,239,for if ever you heard a bloodhound bay
10417,239," you'll know how pressed we be,"
10418,239,
10419,239,"oh, lay your crossbows on the bank"
10420,239," and drop the knives from your hand,"
10421,239,and though the hounds be at your flank
10422,239, i'll save you where you stand!
10423,239,
10424,239,"they laid their crossbows on the bank,"
10425,239," they threw their knives in the wood,"
10426,239,and the ground before them opened and sank
10427,239," and saved 'em where they stood,"
10428,239,
10429,239,"oh, what's the roaring in our ears"
10430,239,  that strikes us well-nigh dumb?
10431,239,"oh, that is just how things appears"
10432,239,"  according as they come,"
10433,239,
10434,239,what are the stars before our eyes
10435,239,  that strike us well-nigh blind?
10436,239,"oh, that is just how things arise"
10437,239,"  according as you find,"
10438,239,
10439,239,and why's our bed so hard to the bones
10440,239,  excepting where it's cold?
10441,239,"oh, that's because it is precious stones"
10442,239,"  excepting where 'tis gold,"
10443,239,
10444,239,"think it over as you stand,"
10445,239,"  for i tell you without fail,"
10446,239,if you haven't got into fairyland
10447,239,"  you're not in lewes gaol,"
10448,239,
10449,239,"all night long they thought of it,"
10450,239," and, come the dawn, they saw"
10451,239,"they'd tumbled into a great old pit,"
10452,239," at the bottom of minepit shaw,"
10453,239,
10454,239,"and the keeper's hound had followed 'em close,"
10455,239, and broke her neck in the fall;
10456,239,so they picked up their knives and their crossbows
10457,239," and buried the dog, that's all,"
10458,239,
10459,239,but whether the man was a poacher too
10460,239, or a pharisee' so bold--
10461,239,"i reckon there's more things told than are true,"
10462,239, and more things true than are told!
10463,240,"now this is the price of a stirrup-cup,"
10464,240," the kneeling doctor said,"
10465,240,"and syne he bade them take him up,"
10466,240," for he saw that the man was dead,"
10467,240,
10468,240,"they took him up, and they laid him down"
10469,240,"   and, oh, he did not stir ,"
10470,240,and they had him into the nearest town
10471,240," to wait the coroner,"
10472,240,
10473,240,"they drew the dead-cloth over the face,"
10474,240," they closed the doors upon,"
10475,240,and the cars that were parked in the market-place
10476,240," made talk of it anon,"
10477,240,
10478,240,"then up and spake a daimler wide,"
10479,240," that carries the slatted tank, --"
10480,240,'tis we must purge the country-side
10481,240," and no man will us thank,"
10482,240,
10483,240,for while they pray at holy kirk
10484,240,"the souls should turn from sin,"
10485,240,"we cock our bonnets to the work,"
10486,240,"and gather the drunken in, --"
10487,240,
10488,240,"and if we spare them for the nonce, --"
10489,240," or their comrades jack them free, --"
10490,240,they learn more under our dumb-irons
10491,240," than they learned at time mother's knee,"
10492,240,
10493,240,"then up and spake an armstrong bold,"
10494,240," and siddeley, was his name, --"
10495,240,i saw a man lie stark and cold
10496,240," by grantham as i came,"
10497,240,
10498,240,"there was a blind turn by a brook,"
10499,240,"  a guard-rail and a fail,"
10500,240,but the drunken loon that overtook
10501,240,  he got no hurt at all!
10502,240,
10503,240,i ha' trodden the wet road and the dry --
10504,240,  but and the shady lane;                '
10505,240,"and  why the  guiltless  soul  should die,"
10506,240,"  good reason find i nane,"
10507,240,
10508,240,then up and spake the babe austin --
10509,240,  had barely room for two --
10510,240,"'tis time and place that make the sin,"
10511,240,"  and not the deed they do,"
10512,240,
10513,240,"for when a man drives with his dear,"
10514,240, i ha' seen it come to pass
10515,240,that an arm too close or a lip too near
10516,240,"  has killed  both  lad  and  lass,"
10517,240,
10518,240,there was a car at eventide
10519,240, and a sidelings kiss to steal --
10520,240,"the god knows how the couple died,"
10521,240," but i mind the inquest weel,"
10522,240,
10523,240,i have trodden the black tar and the heath --
10524,240, but and the cobble-stone;
10525,240,"and why the young go to their death,"
10526,240," good reason find i none,"
10527,240,
10528,240,"then spake a morris from oxenford,"
10529,240," 'was keen to a cowley friar , --"
10530,240,how shall we judge the ways of the lord
10531,240,that are but steel and fire?
10532,240,
10533,240,between the oil-pits under earth
10534,240," and the levin-spark from the skies,"
10535,240,we but adventure and go forth
10536,240," as our man shall devise,"
10537,240,
10538,240,"and if he have drunken a hoop too deep,"
10539,240, no kinship can us move
10540,240,to draw him home in his market-sleep
10541,240," or spare his waiting love,"
10542,240,
10543,240,there is never a lane in all england
10544,240," where a mellow man can go,"
10545,240,but he must look on either hand
10546,240," and back and front also,"
10547,240,
10548,240,"but he must busk him every tide,"
10549,240," at prick of horn, to leap  "
10550,240,either to hide in ditch beside
10551,240," or in the bankes steep,"
10552,240,
10553,240,"and whether he walk in drink or muse,"
10554,240," or for his love be bound,"
10555,240,"we have no wit to mark and chuse,"
10556,240," but needs must slay or wound,"
10557,240,
10558,240,"they drew the dead-cloth from its face,"
10559,240, the crowner looked thereon;
10560,240,and the cars that were parked in the market-place
10561,240," went all their ways anon,"
10562,241,it was our war-ship clampherdown
10563,241,"would sweep the channel clean,"
10564,241,wherefore she kept her hatches close
10565,241,"when the merry channel chops arose,"
10566,241,"to save the bleached marine,"
10567,241,
10568,241,she had one bow-gun of a hundred ton
10569,241,"and a great stern-gun beside,"
10570,241,"they dipped their noses deep in the sea,"
10571,241,they racked their stays and stanchions free
10572,241,"in the wash of the wind-whipped tide,"
10573,241,
10574,241,"it was our war-ship clampherdown,"
10575,241,fell in with a cruiser light
10576,241,that carried the dainty hotchkiss gun
10577,241,and a pair of heels wherewith to run
10578,241,"from the grip of a close-fought fight,"
10579,241,
10580,241,she opened fire at seven miles --
10581,241,as ye shoot at a bobbing cork --
10582,241,"and once she fired and twice she fired,"
10583,241,till the bow-gun dropped like a lily tired
10584,241,"that lolls upon the stalk,"
10585,241,
10586,241,"captain, the bow-gun melts apace,"
10587,241,"the deck-beams break below,"
10588,241,"'twere well to rest for an hour or twain,"
10589,241,"and botch the shattered plates again,"
10590,241,"and he answered, make it so,"
10591,241,
10592,241,she opened fire within the mile --
10593,241,as ye shoot at the flying duck --
10594,241,"and the great stern-gun shot fair and true,"
10595,241,"with the heave of the ship, to the stainless blue,"
10596,241,"and the great stern-turret stuck,"
10597,241,
10598,241,"captain, the turret fills with steam,"
10599,241,the feed-pipes burst below --
10600,241,"you can hear the hiss of the helpless ram,"
10601,241,"you can hear the twisted runners jam,"
10602,241,"and he answered, turn and go!"
10603,241,
10604,241,"it was our war-ship clampherdown,"
10605,241,and grimly did she roll;
10606,241,swung round to take the cruiser's fire
10607,241,as the white whale faces the thresher's ire
10608,241,"when they war by the frozen pole,"
10609,241,
10610,241,"captain, the shells are falling fast,"
10611,241,and faster still fall we;
10612,241,and it is not meet for english stock
10613,241,to bide in the heart of an eight-day clock
10614,241,"the death they cannot see,"
10615,241,
10616,241,"lie down, lie down, my bold a,b,,"
10617,241,we drift upon her beam;
10618,241,"we dare not ram, for she can run;"
10619,241,"and dare ye fire another gun,"
10620,241,and die in the peeling steam?
10621,241,
10622,241,it was our war-ship clampherdown
10623,241,that carried an armour-belt;
10624,241,but fifty feet at stern and bow
10625,241,"lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow,"
10626,241,"to the hail of the nordenfeldt,"
10627,241,
10628,241,"captain, they hack us through and through;"
10629,241,the chilled steel bolts are swift!
10630,241,"we have emptied our bunkers in open sea,"
10631,241,"their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be,"
10632,241,"and he answered, let her drift,"
10633,241,
10634,241,"it was our war-ship clampherdown,"
10635,241,"swung round upon the tide,"
10636,241,"her two dumb guns glared south and north,"
10637,241,"and the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth,"
10638,241,"and she ground the cruiser's side,"
10639,241,
10640,241,"captain, they cry, the fight is done,"
10641,241,"they bid you send your sword,"
10642,241,"and he answered, grapple her stern and bow,"
10643,241,"they have asked for the steel,  they shall have it now;"
10644,241,out cutlasses and board!
10645,241,
10646,241,it was our war-ship clampherdown
10647,241,spewed up four hundred men;
10648,241,"and the scalded stokers yelped delight,"
10649,241,"as they rolled in the waist and heard the fight,"
10650,241,"stamp o'er their steel-walled pen,"
10651,241,
10652,241,"they cleared the cruiser end to end,"
10653,241,"from conning-tower to hold,"
10654,241,they fought as they fought in nelson's fleet;
10655,241,"they were stripped to the waist, they were bare to the feet,"
10656,241,"as it was in the days of old,"
10657,241,
10658,241,it was the sinking clampherdown
10659,241,heaved up her battered side --
10660,241,"and carried a million pounds in steel,"
10661,241,"to the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel,"
10662,241,"and the scour of the channel tide,"
10663,241,
10664,241,it was the crew of the clampherdown
10665,241,"stood out to sweep the sea,"
10666,241,"on a cruiser won from an ancient foe,"
10667,241,"as it was in the days of long ago,"
10668,241,and as it still shall be!
10669,242,"when spring-time flushes the desert grass,"
10670,242,"our kafilas wind through the khyber pass,"
10671,242,"lean are the camels but fat the frails,"
10672,242,"light are the purses but heavy the bales,"
10673,242,as the snowbound trade of the north comes down
10674,242,"to the market-square of peshawur town,"
10675,242,
10676,242,"in a turquoise twilight, crisp and chill,"
10677,242,"a kafila camped at the foot of the hill,"
10678,242,"then blue smoke-haze of the cooking rose,"
10679,242,and tent-peg answered to  hammer-nose;
10680,242,"and the picketed ponies, shag and wild,"
10681,242,strained at their ropes as the feed was piled;
10682,242,and the bubbling camels beside the load
10683,242,sprawled for a furlong adown the road;
10684,242,"and the persian pussy-cats, brought for sale,"
10685,242,spat at the dogs from the camel-bale;
10686,242,and the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food;
10687,242,and the camp-fires twinkled by fort jumrood;
10688,242,and there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk
10689,242,"a savour of camels and carpets and musk,"
10690,242,"a murmur of voices, a reek of smoke,"
10691,242,"to tell us the trade of the khyber woke,"
10692,242,
10693,242,"the lid of the flesh-pot chattered high,"
10694,242,the knives were whetted and -- then came i
10695,242,"to mahbub ali the muleteer,"
10696,242,"patching his bridles and counting his gear,"
10697,242,"crammed with the gossip of half a year,"
10698,242,"but mahbub ali the kindly said,"
10699,242,"better is speech when the belly is fed,"
10700,242,so we plunged the hand to the mid-wrist deep
10701,242,"in a cinnamon stew of the fat-tailed sheep,"
10702,242,"and he who never hath tasted the food,"
10703,242,"by allah! he knoweth not bad from good,"
10704,242,
10705,242,"we cleansed our beards of the mutton-grease,"
10706,242,"we lay on the mats and were filled with peace,"
10707,242,"and the talk slid north, and the talk slid south,"
10708,242,"with the sliding puffs from the hookah-mouth,"
10709,242,"four things greater than all things are, --"
10710,242,"women and horses and power and war,"
10711,242,"we spake of them all, but the last the most,"
10712,242,"for i sought a word of a russian post,"
10713,242,"of a shifty promise, an unsheathed sword"
10714,242,"and a gray-coat guard on the helmund ford,"
10715,242,then mahbub ali lowered his eyes
10716,242,"in the fashion of one who is weaving lies,"
10717,242,"quoth he,  of the russians who can say?"
10718,242,"when the night is gathering all is gray,"
10719,242,but we look that the gloom of the night shall die
10720,242,"in the morning flush of a blood-red sky,"
10721,242,"friend of my heart, is it meet or wise"
10722,242,to warn a king of his enemies?
10723,242,"we know what heaven or hell may bring,"
10724,242,"but no man knoweth the mind of the king,"
10725,242,that unsought counsel is cursed of god
10726,242,"attesteth the story of wali dad,"
10727,242,
10728,242,"his sire was leaky of tongue and pen,"
10729,242,his dam was a clucking khuttuck hen;
10730,242,"and the colt bred close to the vice of each,"
10731,242,"for he carried the curse of an unstanched speech,"
10732,242,therewith madness -- so that he sought
10733,242,the favour of kings at the kabul court;
10734,242,"and travelled, in hope of honour, far"
10735,242,"to the line where the gray-coat squadrons are,"
10736,242,there have i journeyed too -- but i
10737,242,"saw naught, said naught, and -- did not die!"
10738,242,"he harked to rumour, and snatched at a breath"
10739,242,"of `this one knoweth' and `that one saith', --"
10740,242,legends that ran from mouth to mouth
10741,242,"of a gray-coat coming, and sack of the south,"
10742,242,these have i also heard -- they pass
10743,242,"with each new spring and the winter grass,"
10744,242,
10745,242,"hot-foot southward, forgotten of god,"
10746,242,"back to the city ran wali dad,"
10747,242,even to kabul -- in full durbar
10748,242,"the king held talk with his chief in war,"
10749,242,"into the press of the crowd he broke,"
10750,242,"and what he had heard of the coming spoke,"
10751,242,
10752,242,"then gholam hyder, the red chief, smiled,"
10753,242,as a mother might on a babbling child;
10754,242,"but those who would laugh restrained their breath,"
10755,242,"when the face of the king showed dark as death,"
10756,242,evil it is in full durbar
10757,242,to cry to a ruler of gathering war!
10758,242,"slowly he led to a peach-tree small,"
10759,242,"that grew by a cleft of the city wall,"
10760,242,"and he said to the boy,  `they shall praise thy zeal"
10761,242,"so long as the red spurt follows the steel,"
10762,242,and the russ is upon us even now?
10763,242,"great is thy prudence -- await them, thou,"
10764,242,"watch from the tree,  thou art young and strong,"
10765,242,"surely thy vigil is not for long,"
10766,242,"the russ is upon us, thy clamour ran?"
10767,242,"surely an hour shall bring their van,"
10768,242,"wait and watch,  when the host is near,"
10769,242,"shout aloud that my men may hear,'"
10770,242,
10771,242,"friend of my heart, is it meet or wise"
10772,242,to warn a king of his enemies?
10773,242,a guard was set that he might not flee --
10774,242,"a score of bayonets ringed the tree,"
10775,242,"the peach-bloom fell in showers of snow,"
10776,242,"when he shook at his death as he looked below,"
10777,242,"by the power of god, who alone is great,"
10778,242,"till the seventh day he fought with his fate,"
10779,242,"then madness took him, and men declare"
10780,242,"he mowed in the branches as ape and bear,"
10781,242,"and last as a sloth, ere his body failed,"
10782,242,"and he hung as a bat in the forks, and wailed,"
10783,242,"and sleep the cord of his hands untied,"
10784,242,"and he fell, and was caught on the points and died,"
10785,242,
10786,242,"heart of my heart, is it meet or wise"
10787,242,to warn a king of his enemies?
10788,242,"we know what heaven or hell may bring,"
10789,242,"but no man knoweth the mind of the king,"
10790,242,of the gray-coat coming who can say?
10791,242,"when the night is gathering all is gray,"
10792,242,"two things greater than all things are,"
10793,242,"the first is love, and the second war,"
10794,242,"and since we know not how war may prove,"
10795,242,"heart of my heart, let us talk of love!"
10796,243,"abdhur rahman, the durani chief, of him is the story told,"
10797,243,          his mercy fills the khyber hills -- his grace is manifold;
10798,243,          he has taken toll of the north and the south --
10799,243,"            his glory reacheth far,"
10800,243,"          and they tell the tale of his charity from balkh to kandahar,"
10801,243,
10802,243,"before the old peshawur gate, where kurd and kaffir meet,"
10803,243,"the governor of kabul dealt the justice of the street,"
10804,243,"and that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife,"
10805,243,"tho' he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life,"
10806,243,
10807,243,"there was a hound of hindustan had struck a euzufzai,"
10808,243,"wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die,"
10809,243,it chanced the king went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife;
10810,243,"the kaffir grovelled under-hoof and clamoured for his life,"
10811,243,
10812,243,"then said the king,  have hope, o friend!  yea, death disgraced is hard;"
10813,243,"much honour shall be thine; and called the captain of the guard,"
10814,243,"yar khan, a bastard of the blood, so city-babble saith,"
10815,243,and he was honoured of the king -- the which is salt to death;
10816,243,"and he was son of daoud shah, the reiver of the plains,"
10817,243,and blood of old durani lords ran fire in his veins;
10818,243,"and 'twas to tame an afghan pride nor hell nor heaven could bind,"
10819,243,"the king would make him butcher to a yelping cur of hind,"
10820,243,
10821,243,"strike! said the king,  king's blood art thou --"
10822,243,  his death shall be his pride!
10823,243,"then louder, that the crowd might catch,  fear not -- his arms are tied!"
10824,243,"yar khan drew clear the khyber knife, and struck, and sheathed again,"
10825,243,"o man, thy will is done, quoth he; a king this dog hath slain,"
10826,243,
10827,243,"          abdhur rahman, the durani chief, to the north and the south is sold,"
10828,243,          the north and the south shall open their mouth
10829,243,"            to a ghilzai flag unrolled,"
10830,243,"          when the big guns speak to the khyber peak, and his dog-heratis fly,"
10831,243,          ye have heard the song -- how long?  how long?
10832,243,            wolves of the abazai!
10833,243,
10834,243,"that night before the watch was set, when all the streets were clear,"
10835,243,"the governor of kabul spoke,  my king, hast thou no fear?"
10836,243,"thou knowest -- thou hast heard, -- his speech died at his master's face,"
10837,243,"and grimly said the afghan king,  i rule the afghan race,"
10838,243,my path is mine -- see thou to thine -- to-night upon thy bed

10840,243,
10841,243,"that night when all the gates were shut to city and to throne,"

10844,243,"yar khan came softly to the king to make his honour white,"
10845,243,"the children of the town had mocked beneath his horse's hoofs,"
10846,243,"the harlots of the town had hailed him butcher! from their roofs,"
10847,243,"but as he groped against the wall, two hands upon him fell,"
10848,243,"the king behind his shoulder spake,  dead man, thou dost not well!"
10849,243,'tis ill to jest with kings by day and seek a boon by night;
10850,243,"and that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write,"
10851,243,"but three days hence, if god be good, and if thy strength remain,"
10852,243,"thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain,"
10853,243,"for i am merciful to all, and most of all to thee,"

10859,243,"            when the swollen banks break forth,"
10860,243,"          when the red-coats crawl to the sungar wall,"
10861,243,"            and his usbeg lances fail,"
10862,243,          ye have heard the song -- how long?  how long?
10863,243,            wolves of the zuka kheyl!
10864,243,
10865,243,"they stoned him in the rubbish-field when dawn was in the sky,"
10866,243,"according to the written word, see that he do not die,"
10867,243,
10868,243,"they stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain,"

10870,243,
10871,243,"one watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered thing,"

10887,243,
10888,243,"they shot him at the morning prayer, to ease him of his pain,"
10889,243,"and when he heard the matchlocks clink, he blessed the king again,"
10890,243,
10891,243,"which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing,"

11279,252," man fashioned coats of mail,"
11280,252,
11281,252,then was there safety for the rich
11282,252," and danger for the poor,"
11283,252,till someone mixed a powder which
11284,252," redressed the scale once more,"
11285,252,
11286,252,helmet and armour disappeared
11287,252," with sword and bow and pike,"
11288,252,"and, when the smoke of battle cleared,"
11289,252," all men were armed alike,   ,   ,   ,"
11290,252,
11291,252,and when ten million such were slain
11292,252," to please one crazy king,"
11293,252,"man, schooled in bulk by fear and pain,"

11296,252,"and, at the very hour designed,"
11297,252," to enslave him past recall,"
11298,252,his tooth-stone-arrow-gun-shy mind

11301,252,"all power, each tyrant, every mob"
11302,252,"whose head has grown too large,"
11303,252,ends by destroying its own job
11304,252,and works its own discharge;
11305,252,
11306,252,"and man, whose mere necessities"
11307,252,"move all things from his path,"
11308,252,"trembles meanwhile at their decrees,"
11309,252,and deprecates their wrath!
11310,253,"open the old cigar-box, get me a cuba stout,"
11311,253,"for things are running crossways, and maggie and i are out,"
11312,253,
11313,253,"we quarrelled about havanas -- we fought o'er a good cheroot,"

11317,253,"in the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on maggie's face,"
11318,253,
11319,253,"maggie is pretty to look at -- maggie's a loving lass,"

11321,253,
11322,253,"there's peace in a larranaga, there's calm in a henry clay;"
11323,253,but the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away --
11324,253,
11325,253,thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown --
11326,253,but i could not throw away maggie for fear o' the talk o' the town!

11328,253,"maggie, my wife at fifty -- grey and dour and old --"
11329,253,with never another maggie to purchase for love or gold!
11330,253,
11331,253,"and the light of days that have been the dark of the days that are,"
11332,253,"and love's torch stinking and stale, like the butt of a dead cigar --"
11333,253,
11334,253,the butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in your pocket --
11335,253,with never a new one to light tho' it's charred and black to the socket!
11336,253,
11337,253,"open the old cigar-box -- let me consider a while,"
11338,253,"here is a mild manila -- there is a wifely smile,"
11339,253,
11340,253,"which is the better portion -- bondage bought with a ring,"
11341,253,"or a harem of dusky beauties, fifty tied in a string?"
11342,253,
11343,253,"counsellors cunning and silent -- comforters true and tried,"
11344,253,and never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride?
11345,253,
11346,253,"thought in the early morning, solace in time of woes,"
11347,253,"peace in the hush of the twilight, balm ere my eyelids close,"
11348,253,
11349,253,"this will the fifty give me, asking nought in return,"
11350,253,"with only a suttee's passion -- to do their duty and burn,"
11351,253,
11352,253,"this will the fifty give me, when they are spent and dead,"
11353,253,"five times other fifties shall be my servants instead,"
11354,253,
11355,253,"the furrows of far-off java, the isles of the spanish main,"
11356,253,"when they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again,"
11357,253,
11358,253,"i will take no heed to their raiment, nor food for their mouths withal,"
11359,253,"so long as the gulls are nesting, so long as the showers fall,"
11360,253,
11361,253,"i will scent 'em with best vanilla, with tea will i temper their hides,"
11362,253,"and the moor and the mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides,"
11363,253,
11364,253,for maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
11365,253,"the wee little whimpering love and the great god nick o' teen,"
11366,253,
11367,253,"and i have been servant of love for barely a twelvemonth clear,"
11368,253,but i have been priest of cabanas a matter of seven year;
11369,253,
11370,253,and the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
11371,253,"of stums that i burned to friendship and pleasure and work and fight,"
11372,253,
11373,253,"and i turn my eyes to the future that maggie and i must prove,"
11374,253,"but the only light on the marshes is the will-o'-the-wisp of love,"
11375,253,
11376,253,will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire?
11377,253,"since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall i follow the fitful fire?"
11378,253,
11379,253,open the old cigar-box -- let me consider anew --
11380,253,"old friends, and who is maggie that i should abandon you?"
11381,253,
11382,253,a million surplus maggies are willing to bear the yoke;
11383,253,"and a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke,"
11384,253,
11385,253,"light me another cuba -- i hold to my first-sworn vows,"
11386,253,"if maggie will have no rival, i'll have no maggie for spouse!"

12603,290,"shifts and considers, wanes and recovers, scatters and sickens and dies —"

12611,290,

12625,290,"now, it may fall, we have slain our sons, as our fathers we have betrayed,"
12626,290,

12698,292,i have chased it north to the lizard -- ribboned and rolled and torn;
12699,292,"i have spread its fold o'er the dying, adrift in a hopeless sea;"
12700,292,"i have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the slave set free,"
12701,292,
12702,292,"my basking sunfish know it, and wheeling albatross,"
12703,292,"where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the southern cross,"
12704,292,"what is the flag of england?  ye have but my reefs to dare,"
12705,292,"ye have but my seas to furrow,  go forth, for it is there!"
12706,292,
12707,292,"the east wind roared, -- from the kuriles, the bitter seas, i come,"
12708,292,"and me men call the home-wind, for i bring the english home,"
12709,292,look -- look well to your shipping!  by the breath of my mad typhoon
12710,292,i swept your close-packed praya and beached your best at kowloon!
12711,292,
12712,292,"the reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before,"
12713,292,i raped your richest roadstead -- i plundered singapore!
12714,292,"i set my hand on the hoogli; as a hooded snake she rose,"
12715,292,"and i flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows,"
12716,292,
12717,292,"never the lotus closes, never the wild-fowl wake,"
12718,292,but a soul goes out on the east wind that died for england's sake --
12719,292,"man or woman or suckling, mother or bride or maid --"
12720,292,"because on the bones of the english the english flag is stayed,"
12721,292,
12722,292,"the desert-dust hath dimmed it, the flying wild-ass knows,"
12723,292,"the scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows,"
12724,292,"what is the flag of england?  ye have but my sun to dare,"
12725,292,"ye have but my sands to travel,  go forth, for it is there!"
12726,292,
12727,292,"the west wind called, -- in squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly"
12728,292,"that bear the wheat and cattle lest street-bred people die,"
12729,292,"they make my might their porter, they make my house their path,"
12730,292,"till i loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath,"
12731,292,
12732,292,"i draw the gliding fog-bank as a snake is drawn from the hole,"
12733,292,"they bellow one to the other, the frighted ship-bells toll,"
12734,292,"for day is a drifting terror till i raise the shroud with my breath,"
12735,292,"and they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death,"
12736,292,
12737,292,"but whether in calm or wrack-wreath, whether by dark or day,"
12738,292,"i heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away,"
12739,292,"first of the scattered legions, under a shrieking sky,"
12740,292,"dipping between the rollers, the english flag goes by,"
12741,292,
12742,292,the dead dumb fog hath wrapped it -- the frozen dews have kissed --
12743,292,"the naked stars have seen it, a fellow-star in the mist,"
12744,292,"what is the flag of england?  ye have but my breath to dare,"
12745,292,"ye have but my waves to conquer,  go forth, for it is there!"
12746,293,"now the new year reviving old desires,"
12747,293,"the restless soul to open sea aspires,"
12748,293,"where the blue peter flickers from the fore,"
12749,293,"and the grimed stoker feeds the engine-fires,"
12750,293,"coupons, alas, depart with all their rows,"
12751,293,and last year's sea-met loves where grindley knows;
12752,293,"but still the wild wind wakes off gardafui,"
12753,293,"and hearts turn eastward with the p, and o's,"
12754,293,
12755,293,"twelve knots an hour, be they more or less -"
12756,293,"oh slothful mother of much idleness,"
12757,293,whom neither rivals spur nor contracts speed!
12758,293,"nay, bear us gently! wherefore need we press?"
12759,293,
12760,293,the tragedy of all our east is laid
12761,293,on those white decks beneath the awning shade -
12762,293,"birth, absence, longing, laughter, love and tears,"
12763,293,"and death unmaking ere the land is made,"
12764,293,
12765,293,and midnight madnesses of souls distraught
12766,293,"whom the cool seas call through the open port,"
12767,293,"so that the table lacks one place next morn,"
12768,293,"and for one forenoon men forego their sport,"
12769,293,
12770,293,the shadow of the rigging to and fro
12771,293,"sways, shifts, and flickers on the spar-deck's snow,"
12772,293,"and like a giant trampling in his chains,"
12773,293,the screw-blades gasp and thunder deep below;
12774,293,
12775,293,"and, leagued to watch one flying-fish's wings,"
12776,293,"heaven stoops to sea, and sea to heaven clings;"
12777,293,"while, bent upon the ending of his toil,"
12778,293,"the hot sun strides, regarding not these things,"
12779,293,
12780,293,for the same wave that meets our stem in spray
12781,293,"bore smith of asia eastward yesterday,"
12782,293,and delhi jones and brown of midnapore
12783,293,"to-morrow follow on the self-same way,"
12784,293,
12785,293,"linked in the chain of empire one by one,"
12786,293,"flushed with long leave, or tanned with many a sun,"
12787,293,the exiles' line brings out the exiles line
12788,293,"and ships them homeward when their work is done,"
12789,293,
12790,293,"yea, heedless of the shuttle through the loom,"
12791,293,"the flying keels fulfil the web of doom,"
12792,293,sorrow or shouting; what is that to them?
12793,293,make out the cheque that pays for cabin room!
12794,293,
12795,293,and how so many score of times ye flit
12796,293,"with wife and babe and caravan of kit,"
12797,293,"not all thy travels past shall lower one fare,"
12798,293,"not all thy tears abate one pound of it,"
12799,293,
12800,293,"and how so high throe earth-born dignity,"
12801,293,"honour and state, go sink it in the sea,"
12802,293,"till that great one upon the quarter deck,"
12803,293,"brow-bound with gold, shall give thee leave to be,"
12804,293,
12805,293,"indeed, indeed from that same line we swear"
12806,293,"off for all time, and mean it when we swear;"
12807,293,"and then, and then we meet the quartered flag,"
12808,293,"and, surely for the last time, pay the fare,"
12809,293,
12810,293,"and green of kensington, estray ed to view"
12811,293,"in three short months the world he never knew,"
12812,293,stares with blind eyes upon the quartered
12813,293,"flag and sees no more than yellow, red and blue,"
12814,293,
12815,293,"but we, the gypsies of the east, but we"
12816,293,waifs of the land and wastrels of the sea
12817,293,come nearer home beneath the quartered flag
12818,293,"than ever home shall come to such as we,"
12819,293,
12820,293,"the camp is struck, the bungalow decays,"
12821,293,"dead friends and houses desert mark our ways,"
12822,293,till sickness send us down to prince's dock
12823,293,"to meet the changeless use of many days,"
12824,293,
12825,293,"bound in the wheel of empire, one by one,"
12826,293,"the chain-gangs of the east from sire to son,"
12827,293,the exiles' line takes out the exiles line
12828,293,"and ships them homeward when their work is done,"
12829,293,
12830,293,"how runs the old indictment? dear and slow,"
12831,293,"so much and twice so much, we gird, but go,"
12832,293,"for all the soul of our sad east is there,"
12833,293,"beneath the house-flag of the p, and o,"
12834,294,"youth that trafficked long with death,"
12835,294,"  and to second life returns,"
12836,294,squanders little time or breath
12837,294,"  on his fellow--man's concerns,"
12838,294,earned peace is all he asks
12839,294,"to fulfill his broken tasks,"
12840,294,
12841,294,"yet, if he find war at home"
12842,294,"  waspish and importunate,"
12843,294,he hath means to overcome
12844,294,  any warrior at his gate;
12845,294,for the past he buried brings
12846,294,back unburiable things--
12847,294,
12848,294,"nights that he lay out to spy,"
12849,294,  whence and when the raid might start;
12850,294,or prepared in secrecy
12851,294,  sudden blows to break its heart--
12852,294,all the lore of no-man's land
12853,294,"steels his soul and arms his hand,"
12854,294,
12855,294,"so, if conflict vex his life"
12856,294,"  where he thought all conflict done,"
12857,294,"he, resuming ancient strife,"
12858,294,  springs his mine or trains his gun;
12859,294,"and, in mirth more dread than wrath,"
12860,294,wipes the nuisance from his path!
12861,295,love and death once ceased their strife
12862,295,"at the tavern of man's life,"
12863,295,"called for wine, and threw -- alas! --"
12864,295,"each his quiver on the grass,"
12865,295,when the bout was o'er they found
12866,295,"mingled arrows strewed the ground,"
12867,295,hastily they gathered then
12868,295,"each the loves and lives of men,"
12869,295,"ah, the fateful dawn deceived!"
12870,295,mingled arrows each one sheaved;
12871,295,death's dread armoury was stored
12872,295,with the shafts he most abhorred;
12873,295,love's light quiver groaned beneath
12874,295,"venom-headed darts of death,"
12875,295,
12876,295,thus it was they wrought our woe
12877,295,"at the tavern long ago,"
12878,295,"tell me, do our masters know,"
12879,295,"loosing blindly as they fly,"
12880,295,old men love while young men die?
12881,296,there's no sense in going further --
12882,296,"it's the edge of cultivation,"
12883,296,"so they said, and i believed it --"
12884,296,broke my land and sowed my crop --
12885,296,built my barns and strung my fences
12886,296,in the little border station
12887,296,tucked away below the foothills
12888,296,"where the trails run out and stop,"
12889,296,
12890,296,"till a voice, as bad as conscience,"
12891,296,rang interminable changes
12892,296,in one everlasting whisper
12893,296,"day and night repeated -- so,"
12894,296,"something hidden, go and find it,"
12895,296,go and look behind the ranges --
12896,296,"something lost behind the ranges,"
12897,296,"lost and waiting for you, go!"
12898,296,
12899,296,"so i went, worn out of patience;"
12900,296,never told my nearest neighbours --
12901,296,stole away with pack and ponies --
12902,296,left 'em drinking in the town;
12903,296,and the faith that moveth mountains
12904,296,didn't seem to help my labours
12905,296,"as i faced the sheer main-ranges,"
12906,296,"whipping up and leading down,"
12907,296,
12908,296,"march by march i puzzled through 'em,"
12909,296,"turning flanks and dodging shoulders,"
12910,296,"hurried on in hope of water,"
12911,296,headed back for lack of grass;
12912,296,till i camped above the tree-line --
12913,296,drifted snow and naked boulders --
12914,296,felt free air astir to windward --
12915,296,"knew i'd stumbled on the pass,"
12916,296,
12917,296,'thought to name it for the finder;
12918,296,but that night the norther found me --
12919,296,froze and killed the plains-bred ponies;
12920,296,"so i called the camp despair,"
12921,296,"it's the railway cap today, though,  "
12922,296,"then my whisper waked to hound me,"
12923,296,"something lost behind the ranges,"
12924,296,over yonder! go you there!
12925,296,
12926,296,"then i knew, the while i doubted --"
12927,296,"knew his hand was certain o'er me,"
12928,296,still -- it might be self-delusion --
12929,296,scores of better men had died --
12930,296,"i could reach the township living,"
12931,296,"but , he knows what terrors tore me ,"
12932,296,"but i didn't , but i didn't,"
12933,296,"i went down the other side,"
12934,296,
12935,296,"till the snow ran out in flowers,"
12936,296,"and the flowers turned to aloes,"
12937,296,and the aloes sprung to thickets
12938,296,and a brimming stream ran by;
12939,296,"but the thickets dwined to thorn-scrub,"
12940,296,"and the water drained to shallows,"
12941,296,and i dropped again on
12942,296,"desert-blasted earth and blasting sky ,"
12943,296,
12944,296,i remember lighting fires;
12945,296,i remember sitting by them;
12946,296,"i remember seeing faces,"
12947,296,hearing voices through the smoke;
12948,296,i remember they were fancy --
12949,296,"for i threw a stone to try 'em,"
12950,296,something lost behind the ranges
12951,296,"was the only word they spoke,"
12952,296,
12953,296,"i remember going crazy,"
12954,296,i remember that i knew it
12955,296,when i heard myself hallooing
12956,296,"to the funny folk i saw,"
12957,296,very full of dreams that desert;
12958,296,"but my two legs took me through it ,"
12959,296,and i used to watch 'em moving
12960,296,"with the toes all black and raw,"
12961,296,
12962,296,but at last the country altered --
12963,296,white man's country past disputing --
12964,296,"rolling grass and open timber,"
12965,296,with a hint of hills behind --
12966,296,"there i found me food and water,"
12967,296,"and i lay a week recruiting,"
12968,296,"got my strength and lost my nightmares,"
12969,296,"then i entered on my find,"
12970,296,
12971,296,thence i ran my first rough survey --
12972,296,chose my trees and blazed and ringed 'em --
12973,296,week by week i pried and sampled --
12974,296,"week by week my findings grew,"
12975,296,"saul, he went to look for donkeys,"
12976,296,and by god he found a kingdom!
12977,296,"but by god, who sent his whisper,"
12978,296,i had struck the worth of two!
12979,296,
12980,296,"up along the hostile mountains,"
12981,296,where the hair-poised snowslide shivers --
12982,296,down and through the big fat marshes
12983,296,"that the virgin ore-bed stains,"
12984,296,till i heard the mild-wide mutterings
12985,296,"of unimagined rivers,"
12986,296,and beyond the nameless timber
12987,296,saw illimitable plains!
12988,296,
12989,296,"plotted sites of future cities,"
12990,296,traced the easy grades between 'em;
12991,296,watched unharnessed rapids wasting
12992,296,fifty thousand head an hour;
12993,296,counted leagues of water frontage
12994,296,through the axe-ripe woods that screen 'em --
12995,296,saw the plant to feed a people --
12996,296,up and waiting for the power!
12997,296,
12998,296,"well, i know who'll take the credit --"
12999,296,all the clever chaps that followed --
13000,296,came a dozen men together --
13001,296,never knew my desert fears;
13002,296,"tracked me by the camps i'd quitted,"
13003,296,"used the water holes i'd hollowed,"
13004,296,"they'll go back and do the talking,"
13005,296,they'll be called the pioneers!
13006,296,
13007,296,they will find my sites of townships --
13008,296,"not the cities that i set there,"
13009,296,they will rediscover rivers --
13010,296,"not my rivers heard at night,"
13011,296,by my own old marks and bearings
13012,296,"they will show me how to get there,"
13013,296,by the lonely cairns i builded
13014,296,"they will guide my feet aright,"
13015,296,
13016,296,"have i named one single river,  "
13017,296,have i claimed one single acre?
13018,296,have i kept one single nugget --
13019,296,"barring samples?  no, not i!"
13020,296,because my price was paid me
13021,296,"ten times over by my maker,"
13022,296,"but you wouldn't understand it,"
13023,296,"you go up and occupy,"
13024,296,
13025,296,ores you'll find there; wood and cattle;
13026,296,"water-transit sure and steady,"
13027,296,that should keep the railway rates down
13028,296,"coal and iron at your doors,"
13029,296,god took care to hide that country
13030,296,"till he judged his people ready,"
13031,296,"then he chose me for his whisper,"
13032,296,"and i've found it, and it's yours!"
13033,296,
13034,296,"yes, your never-never country --"
13035,296,"yes, your edge of cultivation"
13036,296,and no sense in going further --
13037,296,"till i crossed the range to see,"
13038,296,"god forgive me! no, i didn't,"
13039,296,"it's god's present to our nation,"
13040,296,anybody might have found it --
13041,296,but his whisper came to me!
13042,297,"when  all the world would keep a matter hid,"
13043,297," since truth is seldom friend to any crowd,"
13044,297,"men write  in fable, as old aesop did,"
13045,297," jesting at that which none will name aloud,"
13046,297,"and this they needs must do, or it will fall"
13047,297,"unless they please they are not heard at all,"
13048,297,
13049,297,when desperate folly  daily laboureth
13050,297,"    to work confusion upon all we have,"
13051,297,"when diligent sloth  demandeth freedom's  death,"
13052,297,   and banded fear commandeth honour's grave--
13053,297,"even in that certain hour before the fall,"
13054,297,"unless men please they are not heard at all,"
13055,297,
13056,297,"needs must all please, yet some not all for need,"
13057,297," needs must all toil, yet some not all for gain,"
13058,297,but that men taking pleasure may take heed
13059,297,"  whom present toil shall snatch from later pain,"
13060,297,"thus some have toiled, but their reward was small"
13061,297,"since, though they pleased, they were not heard at all,"
13062,297,
13063,297,"this was the lock that lay upon our lips,"
13064,297," this was the yoke that we have undergone,"
13065,297,denying us all pleasant fellowships
13066,297," as in our time and generation,"
13067,297,"our pleasures unpursued age past recall,"
13068,297,"and for our pains--we are not heard at all,"

13425,303,
13426,303,with every shift of every wind
13427,303," the homesick memories come,"
13428,303,from every quarter of mankind
13429,303," where i have made me a home,"
13430,303,
13431,303,four times a fire against the cold

13433,303,sorrow fourfold and joy fourfold
13434,303, the four winds bring again!
13435,303,
13436,303,how can i answer which is best
13437,303, of all the fires that burn?
13438,303,i have been too often host or guest
13439,303," at every fire in turn,"
13440,303,
13441,303,"how can i turn from any fire,"
13442,303, on any man's hearthstone?
13443,303,i know the wonder and desire
13444,303, that went to build my own!
13445,303,
13446,303,how can i doubt man's joy or woe
13447,303," where'er his house-fires shine,"
13448,303,since all that man must undergo
13449,303, will visit me at mine?

13451,303,"oh, you four winds that blow so strong"
13452,303," and know that his is true,"
13453,303,stoop for a little and carry my song
13454,303, to all the men i knew!
13455,303,
13456,303,"where there are fires against the cold,"
13457,303, or roofs against the rain --
13458,303,"with love fourfold and joy fourfold,"
13459,303, take them my songs again!
13460,304,"mine was the woman to me, darkling i found her;"
13461,304,"haling her dumb from the camp, took her and bound her,"
13462,304,hot rose her tribe on our track ere i had proved her;
13463,304,"hearing her laugh in the gloom, greatly i loved her,"
13464,304,
13465,304,"swift through the forest we ran; none stood to guard us,"
13466,304,few were my people and far; then the flood barred us --
13467,304,"him we call son of the sea, sullen and swollen,"
13468,304,"panting we waited the death, stealer and stolen,"
13469,304,
13470,304,"yet ere they came to my lance laid for the slaughter,"
13471,304,lightly she leaped to a log lapped in the water;
13472,304,"holding on high and apart skins that arrayed her,"
13473,304,"called she the god of the wind that he should aid her,"
13474,304,
13475,304,life had the tree at that word praise we the giver!
13476,304,"otter-like left he the bank for the full river,"
13477,304,"far fell their axes behind, flashing and ringing,"
13478,304,wonder was on me and fear -- yet she was singing!
13479,304,
13480,304,"low lay the land we had left,  now the blue bound us,"
13481,304,"even the floor of the gods level around us,"
13482,304,"whisper there was not, nor word, shadow nor showing,"
13483,304,"till the light stirred on the deep, glowing and growing,"
13484,304,
13485,304,"then did he leap to his place flaring from under,"
13486,304,"he the compeller, the sun, bared to our wonder,"
13487,304,"nay, not a league from our eyes blinded with gazing,"
13488,304,"cleared he the gate of the world, huge and amazing!"
13489,304,
13490,304,this we beheld and we live -- the pit of the burning!
13491,304,then the god spoke to the tree for our returning;
13492,304,"back to the beach of our flight, fearless and slowly,"
13493,304,"back to our slayers went he,  but we were holy,"
13494,304,
13495,304,"men that were hot in that hunt, women that followed,"
13496,304,"babes that were promised our bones, trembled and wallowed,"
13497,304,over the necks of the tribe crouching and fawning --
13498,304,prophet and priestess we came back from the dawning!
13499,305,when the grey geese heard the fool's tread
13500,305,"  too near to where they lay,"
13501,305,"they lifted neither voice nor head,"
13502,305," but took themselves away,"
13503,305,
13504,305,"no water broke, no pinion whirred-"
13505,305," there went no warning call,"
13506,305,"the steely, sheltering rushes stirred"
13507,305," a little--that was all,"
13508,305,
13509,305,"only the osiers understood,"
13510,305, and the drowned meadows spied
13511,305,what else than wreckage of a flood
13512,305,"  stole outward on that tide,"
13513,305,
13514,305,but the far beaches saw their ranks
13515,305, gather and greet and grow
13516,305,by myriads on the naked banks
13517,305, watching their sign to go;
13518,305,
13519,305,"till, with a roar of wings that churned"
13520,305," the shivering shoals to foam,"
13521,305,flight after flight took air and turned  -
13522,305,to find a safer home;
13523,305,
13524,305,"and  far below their steadfast wedge,"
13525,305, they heard and hastened on
13526,305,men thresh and clamour through the sedge
13527,305, aghast that they were gone!
13528,305,
13529,305,"and, when men prayed them come anew"

13564,306,the waters shall not reckon twice

13772,311,"free of all that life can offer -- save to handle sweep again,"
13773,311,
13774,311,"by the brand upon my shoulder, by the gall of clinging steel,"
13775,311,"by the welt the whips have left me, by the scars that never heal;"

13778,311,
13779,311,"f times and seasons and of woe the years bring forth,"
13780,311,"of our galley swamped and shattered in the rollers of the north,"
13781,311,"when the niggers break the hatches and the decks are gay with gore,"
13782,311,"and a craven-hearted pilot crams her crashing on the shore,"
13783,311,
13784,311,"she will need no half-mast signal, minute-gun, or rocket-flare,"
13785,311,"when the cry for help goes seaward, she will find her servants there,"
13786,311,"battered chain-gangs of the orlop, grizzled drafts of years gone by,"
13787,311,"to the bench that broke their manhood, they shall lash themselves and die,"

13789,311,"hale and crippled, young and aged, paid, deserted, shipped away --"

13798,312,"the dead child lay in the shroud,"
13799,312,and the widow watched beside;

13801,312,"the gale in the teeth of the tide,"
13802,312,
13803,312,"but the mother laughed at all,"
13804,312,"i have lost my man in the sea,"

13808,312,"the widow watched the dead,"
13809,312,"and the candle guttered low,"

13812,312,
13813,312,"and mary take you now, she sang,"
13814,312,"that lay against my heart,"

13816,312,"but she could not say depart,"
13817,312,
13818,312,"then came a cry from the sea,"
13819,312,"but the sea-rime blinded the glass,"
13820,312,"and heard ye nothing, mother? she said,"
13821,312,"'tis the child that waits to pass,"
13822,312,
13823,312,"and the nodding mother sighed,"
13824,312,"'tis a lambing ewe in the whin,"
13825,312,for why should the christened soul cry out
13826,312,that never knew of sin?

13828,312,"o feet i have held in my hand,"
13829,312,"o hands at my heart to catch,"

13832,312,
13833,312,"they laid a sheet to the door,"
13834,312,"with the little quilt atop,"
13835,312,"that it might not hurt from the cold or the dirt,"
13836,312,"but the crying would not stop,"
13837,312,
13838,312,the widow lifted the latch
13839,312,"and strained her eyes to see,"
13840,312,and opened the door on the bitter shore
13841,312,"to let the soul go free,"
13842,312,
13843,312,"there was neither glimmer nor ghost,"
13844,312,"there was neither spirit nor spark,"
13845,312,"and heard ye nothing, mother? she said,"
13846,312,"'tis crying for me in the dark,"
13847,312,
13848,312,"and the nodding mother sighed,"
13849,312,'tis sorrow makes ye dull;
13850,312,"have ye yet to learn the cry of the tern,"
13851,312,or the wail of the wind-blown gull?

13853,312,"the terns are blown inland,"
13854,312,"the gray gull follows the plough,"

13862,312,
13863,312,"she put her mother aside,"
13864,312,in mary's name let be!
13865,312,"for the peace of my soul i must go, she said,"
13866,312,"and she went to the calling sea,"
13867,312,
13868,312,"in the heel of the wind-bit pier,"
13869,312,"where the twisted weed was piled,"
13870,312,"she came to the life she had missed by an hour,"
13871,312,"for she came to a little child,"
13872,312,
13873,312,"she laid it into her breast,"
13874,312,"and back to her mother she came,"
13875,312,"but it would not feed and it would not heed,"
13876,312,"though she gave it her own child's name,"
13877,312,
13878,312,"and the dead child dripped on her breast,"
13879,312,and her own in the shroud lay stark;
13880,312,"and god forgive us, mother, she said,"
13881,312,we let it die in the dark!
13882,313,"the white moth to the closing bine,"
13883,313," the bee to the opened clover,"

13912,313,follow the romany patteran
13913,313,"  north where the blue bergs sail,"
13914,313,"and the bows are grey with the frozen spray,"
13915,313,"  and the masts are shod with mail,"
13916,313,
13917,313,follow the romany patteran
13918,313," sheer to the austral light,"
13919,313,"where the besom of god is the wild south wind,"
13920,313," sweeping the sea-floors white,"

13926,313,
13927,313,follow the romany patteran
13928,313, east where the silence broods
13929,313,by a purple wave on an opal beach

13932,313,"the wild hawk to the wind-swept sky,"

13941,314,"our england is a garden that is full of stately views,"
13942,314,
13943,314,"of borders, beds and shrubberies and lawns and avenues,"
13944,314,
13945,314,with statues on the terraces and peacocks strutting by;
13946,314,
13947,314,"but the glory of the garden lies in more than meets the eye,"
13948,314,
13949,314,"for where the thick laurels grow, along the thin red wall,"
13950,314,
13951,314,you will find the tool- and potting-sheds which are the heart of all;
13952,314,
13953,314,"the cold-frames and the hot-houses, the dungpits and the tanks,"
13954,314,
13955,314,"the rollers, carts and drain-pipes, with the barrows and the planks,"
13956,314,
13957,314,"and there you'll see the gardners, the men and 'prentice boys"
13958,314,
13959,314,told off to do as they are bid and to it without noise;
13960,314,
13961,314,"for, except when seeds are planted and we shout to scare the birds,"
13962,314,
13963,314,"the glory of the garden it abideth not in words,"
13964,314,
13965,314,"and some can pot begonias and some can bud a rose,"
13966,314,
13967,314,and some are hardly fit to trust with anything that grows;
13968,314,
13969,314,"but they can roll and trim the lawns and sift the sand and loam,"
13970,314,
13971,314,"for the glory of the garden occupieth all who come,"
13972,314,
13973,314,"our england is a garden, and such gardens are not made"
13974,314,
13975,314,"by singing,--oh, how beautiful! and sitting in the shade,"
13976,314,
13977,314,while better men than we go out and start their working lives
13978,314,
13979,314,"at grubbing weeds from gravel-paths with broken dinner-knives,"
13980,314,
13981,314,"there's not a pair of legs so thin, there's not a head so thick,"
13982,314,
13983,314,"there's not a hand so weak and white, nor yet a heart so sick,"
13984,314,
13985,314,"but it can find some needful job that's crying to be done,"
13986,314,
13987,314,"for the glory of the garden glorifieth every one,"
13988,314,
13989,314,"then seek your job with thankfulness and work till further orders,"
13990,314,
13991,314,it it's only netting strawberries or killing slugs on borders;
13992,314,
13993,314,"and when your back stops aching and your hands begin to harden,"
13994,314,
13995,314,"you will find yourself a partner in the glory of the garden,"
13996,314,
13997,314,"oh, adam was a gardener, and god who made him sees"
13998,314,
13999,314,"that half a proper gardener's work is done upon his knees,"
14000,314,
14001,314,"so when your work is finished, you can wash your hands and pray"
14002,314,
14003,314,"for the glory of the garden, that it may not pass away!"
14004,314,
14005,314,"for the glory of the garden, that it may not pass away!"
14006,315,"as i pass through my incarnations in every age and race,"
14007,315,"i make my proper prostrations to the gods of the market-place,"
14008,315,"peering through reverent fingers i watch them flourish and fall,"
14009,315,"and the gods of the copybook headings, i notice, outlast them all,"
14010,315,
14011,315,"we were living in trees when they met us, they showed us each in turn"
14012,315,"that water would certainly wet us, as fire would certainly burn,"
14013,315,"but we found them lacking in uplift, vision and breadth of mind,"
14014,315,"so we left them to teach the gorillas while we followed the march of mankind,"
14015,315,
14016,315,"we moved as the spirit listed, they never altered their pace,"
14017,315,"being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the gods of the market-place,"
14018,315,"but they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come"
14019,315,"that a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in rome,"
14020,315,
14021,315,with the hopes that our world is built on they were utterly out of touch
14022,315,they denied that the moon was stilton; they denied she was even dutch
14023,315,"they denied that wishes were horses; they denied that a pig had wings,"
14024,315,"so we worshipped the gods of the market who promised these beautiful things,"
14025,315,
14026,315,"when the cambrian measures were forming, they promised perpetual peace,"
14027,315,"they swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease,"
14028,315,"but when we disarmed they sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,"
14029,315,"and the gods of the copybook heading said, stick to the devil you know,"
14030,315,
14031,315,on the first feminian sandstones we were promised the fuller life
14032,315,which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife
14033,315,"till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,"
14034,315,"and the gods of the copybook headings said, the wages of sin is death,"
14035,315,
14036,315,"in the carboniferous epoch we were promised abundance for all,"
14037,315,by robbing selected peter to pay for collective paul;
14038,315,"but, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy,"
14039,315,"and the gods of the copybook headings said, if you don't work you die,"
14040,315,
14041,315,"then the gods of the market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew,"
14042,315,and the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true
14043,315,"that all is not gold that glitters, and two and two make four --"
14044,315,"and the gods of the copybook headings limped up to explain it once more,"
14045,315,
14046,315,            *   *   *   *   *
14047,315,
14048,315,"as it will be in the future, it was at the birth of man --"
14049,315,there are only four things certain since social progress began --
14050,315,"that the dog returns to his vomit and the sow returns to her mice,"
14051,315,and the burnt fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the fire --
14052,315,"and that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins"
14053,315,when all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins
14054,315,"as surely as water will wet us, as surely as fire will burn"
14055,315,the gods of the copybook headings with terror and slaughter return!
14056,316,there's a widow in sleepy chester
14057,316, who weeps for her only son;
14058,316,"there's a grave on the pabeng river,"
14059,316," a grave that the burmans shun,"

14062,316,
14063,316,"a snider squibbed in the jungle,"

14065,316,and the men of the first shikaris
14066,316," picked up their subaltern dead,"
14067,316,with a big blue mark in his forehead

14072,316,"took command of the party,"
14073,316," twenty rifles in all,"
14074,316,marched them down to the river
14075,316," as the day was beginning to fall,"
14076,316,
14077,316,"they buried the boy by the river,"
14078,316, a blanket over his face --
14079,316,"they wept for their dead lieutenant,"
14080,316, the men of an alien race --
14081,316,"they made a samadh in his honor,"
14082,316," a mark for his resting-place,"
14083,316,
14084,316,"for they swore by the holy water,"

14086,316,that the soul of lieutenant eshmitt sahib
14087,316, should go to his god in state;
14088,316,with fifty file of burman
14089,316," to open him heaven's gate,"
14090,316,
14091,316,the men of the first shikaris
14092,316," marched till the break of day,"
14093,316,"till they came to the rebel village,"
14094,316, the village of pabengmay --
14095,316,"a jingal covered the clearing,"
14096,316," calthrops hampered the way,"
14097,316,
14098,316,"subadar prag tewarri,"
14099,316," bidding them load with ball,"
14100,316,halted a dozen rifles
14101,316, under the village wall;
14102,316,sent out a flanking-party

14105,316,the men of the first shikaris
14106,316," shouted and smote and slew,"

14108,316," on to the howling crew,"
14109,316,the jemadar's flanking-party
14110,316," butchered the folk who flew,"
14111,316,
14112,316,"long was the morn of slaughter,"
14113,316," long was the list of slain,"
14114,316,"five score heads were taken,"
14115,316, five score heads and twain;
14116,316,and the men of the first shikaris
14117,316," went back to their grave again,"
14118,316,
14119,316,each man bearing a basket
14120,316," red as his palms that day,"
14121,316,red as the blazing village --
14122,316," the village of pabengmay,"
14123,316,and the drip-drip-drip from the baskets
14124,316," reddened the grass by the way,"
14125,316,
14126,316,they made a pile of their trophies
14127,316," high as a tall man's chin,"
14128,316,"head upon head distorted,"
14129,316," set in a sightless grin,"
14130,316,anger and pain and terror

14143,316, the price of a white man slain;
14144,316,and the men of the first shikaris
14145,316," went back into camp again,"
14146,316,
14147,316,"then a silence came to the river,"
14148,316," a hush fell over the shore,"

14859,336,and first they spoke in the witan and then they spoke to the
14860,336,"    king,"
14861,336,"edward king of the saxons, thou knowest from sire to son,"
14862,336,"one is the king and his people--in gain and ungain one,"
14863,336,"count we the gain together, with doubtings and spread dismays"
14864,336,"we have broken a foolish people--but after many days,"
14865,336,"count we the loss together, warlocks hampered our arms,"
14866,336,"we were tricked as by magic, we were turned as by charms,"
14867,336,"we went down to the battle and the road was plain to keep,"
14868,336,"but our angry eyes ever holden, and we struck as they strike"
14869,336,     in sleep--
14870,336,"men new shaken from slumber, sweating with eyes a-stare"
14871,336,"little blows uncertain, dealt on the useless air,"
14872,336,"also a vision betrayed us and a lying tale made bold,"
14873,336,that we looked to hold what we had not and to have what we
14874,336,"      did not hold,"
14875,336,that a shield should give us shelter--that a sword should give us
14876,336,      power--
14877,336,a shield snatched up at a venture and a hilt scarce handled an
14878,336,"    hour,"
14879,336,"that being rich in the open, we should be strong in the close--"
14880,336,and the gods would sell us a cunning for the day that we met
14881,336,"     our foes,"
14882,336,"this was the work of wizards, but not with our foe they bide,"
14883,336,"in our own camp we took them, and their names are sloth and"
14884,336,"      pride,"
14885,336,"our pride was before the battle, our sloth ere we lifted spear,"
14886,336,"but hid in the heart of the people, as the fever hides in the mere,"
14887,336,"waiting only the war-game, the heat of the strife to rise"
14888,336,as the ague fumes round oxeney when the rotting reed-bed
14889,336,"       dries,"
14890,336,but now we are purged of that fever--cleansed by the letting
14891,336,"       of blood,"
14892,336,"something leaner of body--something keener of mood,"
14893,336,"and the men new--freed from the levies return to the fields again,"
14894,336,"matching a hundred battles, cottar and lord and thane;"
14895,336,and they talk loud in the temples where the ancient war-
14896,336,      gods are;
14897,336,"they thumb and mock and belittle the holy harness of war,"
14898,336,"they jest at the sacred chariots, the robes and the gilded staff,"
14899,336,"these things fill them with laughter, they lean on their spears"
14900,336,"     and laugh,"
14901,336,"the men grown old in the war-game, hither and thither they"
14902,336,     range--
14903,336,and scorn and laughter together are sire and dam of change;
14904,336,and change may be good or evil--but we know not what it will
14905,336,      bring;
14906,336,"therefore our king must teach us, that is thy task, o king!"
14907,337,"now we are come to our kingdom,"
14908,337,and the state is thus and thus;
14909,337,our legions wait at the palace gate—
14910,337,"little it profits us,"
14911,337,now we are come to our kingdom!
14912,337,
14913,337,"now we are come to our kingdom,"
14914,337,and the crown is ours to take—
14915,337,"with a naked sword at the council board,"
14916,337,"and under the throne the snake,"
14917,337,now we are come to our kingdom !
14918,337,
14919,337,"now we are come to our kingdom,"
14920,337,"and the realm is ours by right,"
14921,337,"with shame and fear for our daily cheer,"
14922,337,"and heaviness at night,"
14923,337,now we are come to our kingdom !
14924,337,
14925,337,"now we are come to our kingdom,"
14926,337,"but my love's eyelids fall,"
14927,337,"all that i wrought for, all that i fought for,"
14928,337,"delight her nothing at all,"
14929,337,"my crown is of withered leaves,"
14930,337,"for she sits in the dust and grieves,"

14932,338,i've taken my fun where i've found it;

14945,338,"    there's times when you'll think that you mightn't,"

14947,338,"    but the things you will learn from the yellow an' brown,"
14948,338,      they'll 'elp you a lot with the white!
14949,338,
14950,338,"i was a young un at 'oogli,"
14951,338,shy as a girl to begin;

14954,338,"older than me, but my first un --"
14955,338,more like a mother she were --
14956,338,"showed me the way to promotion an' pay,"
14957,338,an' i learned about women from 'er!
14958,338,
14959,338,"then i was ordered to burma,"
14960,338,"actin' in charge o' bazar,"

14995,338,    what did the colonel's lady think?
14996,338,"      nobody never knew,"
14997,338,"    somebody asked the sergeant's wife,"

15008,339,"they have taken away my long jezail,"

15027,339,
15028,339,"but for the sorrow and the shame,"
15029,339,"the brand on me and mine,"

15047,339,
15048,339,"the one i'll shoot at twilight-tide,"

15051,339,"the white man for his brother,"
15052,339,
15053,339,"'tis war, red war, i'll give you then,"
15054,339,war till my sinews fail;
15055,339,"for the wrong you have done to a chief of men,"
15056,339,"and a thief of the zukka kheyl,"
15057,339,
15058,339,and if i fall to your hand afresh
15059,339,"i give you leave for the sin,"
15060,339,"that you cram my throat with the foul pig's flesh,"
15061,339,and swing me in the skin!
15062,340,"when julius fabricius, sub-prefect of the weald,"
15063,340,"in the days of diocletian owned our lower river-field,"
15064,340,"he called to him hobdenius-a briton of the clay,"
15065,340,"saying,  what about that river-piece for layin' in to hay?"
15066,340,
15067,340,"and the aged hobden answered,  i remember as a lad"
15068,340,"my father told your father that she wanted dreenin' bad,"
15069,340,"an' the more that you neeglect her the less you'll get her clean,"
15070,340,"have it jest as you've a mind to, but, if i was you, i'd dreen,"
15071,340,
15072,340,so they drained it long and crossways in the lavish roman style--
15073,340,"still we find among the river-drift their flakes of ancient tile,"
15074,340,"and  in  drouthy  middle  august,  when  the  bones  of  meadows show,"
15075,340,"we can trace the lines they followed sixteen hundred years ago,"
15076,340,
15077,340,"then julius fabricius died as even prefects do,"
15078,340,"and after certain centuries, imperial rome died too,"
15079,340,then did robbers enter britain from across the northern main
15080,340,"and our lower river-field was won by ogier the dane,"
15081,340,
15082,340,well could ogier work his war-boat --well could ogier wield his brand--
15083,340,"much he knew of foaming waters--not so much of farming land,"
15084,340,"so he called to him a hobden of the old unaltered blood,"
15085,340,"saying, what about that river-piece; she doesn't look no good?"
15086,340,
15087,340,"and that aged hobden answered 'tain't for me not interfere,"
15088,340,"but i've known that bit o' meadow now for five and fifty year,"
15089,340,"have it jest as you've a mind to, but i've proved it time on ' time,"
15090,340,if you want to change her nature you have got to give her lime!
15091,340,
15092,340,"ogier sent his wains to lewes, twenty hours' solemn walk,"
15093,340,"and drew back great abundance of the cool, grey, healing chalk,"
15094,340,"and old hobden spread it broadcast, never heeding what was in't,--"
15095,340,"which is why in cleaning ditches, now and then we find a flint,"
15096,340,
15097,340,"ogier died, his sons grew english -- anglo-saxon was their name--"
15098,340,till out of blossomed normandy another pirate came;
15099,340,"for duke william conquered england and divided with his men,"
15100,340,"and our lower river-field he gave to william of warenne,"
15101,340,
15102,340,but the brook you know her habit rose one rainy autumn night  
15103,340,"and tore down sodden flitches of the bank to left and right,"
15104,340,"so, said william to his bailiff as they rode their dripping rounds,"
15105,340,"hob, what about that river-bit--the brook's got up no bounds? "
15106,340,
15107,340,"and that aged hobden answered, 'tain't my business to advise,"
15108,340,"but  ye might ha' known 'twould happen from the way the valley lies,"
15109,340,"where ye can't hold back the water you must try and save the sile,"
15110,340,"hev it jest as you've a mind to, but, if i was you, i'd spile!"
15111,340,
15112,340,"they spiled along the water-course with trunks of willow-trees,"
15113,340,"and planks of elms behind 'em and immortal oaken knees,"
15114,340,and when the spates of autumn whirl the gravel-beds away

15199,342," but thy arm was strong to save,"
15200,342," and it touched us on the wave,"
15201,342,"and we drowsed the long tides idle till thy trumpets tore the sea,"
15202,342,
15203,342,"then cried the soul of the stout apostle paul to god,"
15204,342,"once we frapped a ship, and she laboured woundily,"
15205,342," there were fourteen score of these,"
15206,342," and they blessed thee on their knees,"
15207,342,when they learned thy grace and glory under malta by the sea!
15208,342,
15209,342,"loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,"
15210,342,"plucking at their harps, and they plucked unhandily,"
15211,342," our thumbs are rough and tarred,"
15212,342, and the tune is something hard --
15213,342,may we lift a deep-sea chantey such as seamen use at sea?
15214,342,
15215,342,then said the souls of the gentlemen-adventurers --
15216,342,"fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity,"
15217,342," ho, we revel in our chains"
15218,342, o'er the sorrow that was spain's;
15219,342,"heave or sink it, leave or drink it, we were masters of the sea!"
15220,342,
15221,342,up spake the soul of a gray gothavn 'speckshioner --
15222,342,"he that led the flinching in the fleets of fair dundee,"
15223,342," oh, the ice-blink white and near,"
15224,342, and the bowhead breaching clear!
15225,342,will ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in the sea?
15226,342,
15227,342,"loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,"
15228,342,"crying,  under heaven, here is neither lead nor lee!"
15229,342, must we sing for evermore
15230,342," on the windless, glassy floor?"
15231,342,take back your golden fiddles and we'll beat to open sea!
15232,342,
15233,342,"then stooped the lord, and he called the good sea up to him,"
15234,342,"and 'stablished his borders unto all eternity,"
15235,342, that such as have no pleasure
15236,342," for to praise the lord by measure,"
15237,342,"they may enter into galleons and serve him on the sea,"
15238,342,
15239,342,"    sun, wind, and cloud shall fail not from the face of it,"
15240,342,"     stinging, ringing spindrift, nor the fulmar flying free;"
15241,342,      and the ships shall go abroad
15242,342,      to the glory of the lord
15243,342,     who heard the silly sailor-folk and gave them back their sea!
15244,343,twelve hundred million men are spread
15245,343,"about this earth, and i and you"
15246,343,"   wonder, when you and i are dead,"
15247,343,   what will those luckless millions do?
15248,343,
15249,343,"none whole or clean,  we cry, or free from stain"
15250,343,"of favour, wait awhile, till we attain"
15251,343," the last department where nor fraud nor fools,"
15252,343,"nor grade nor greed, shall trouble us again,"
15253,343,
15254,343,"fear, favour, or affection -- what are these"
15255,343,to the grim head who claims our services?
15256,343, i never knew a wife or interest yet
15257,343,"delay that pukka step, miscalled decease;"
15258,343,
15259,343,"when leave, long overdue, none can deny;"
15260,343,when idleness of all eternity
15261,343," becomes our furlough, and the marigold"
15262,343,"our thriftless, bullion-minting treasury"
15263,343,
15264,343,"transferred to the eternal settlement,"
15265,343,"each in his strait, wood-scantled office pent,"
15266,343," no longer brown reverses smith's appeals,"
15267,343,"or jones records his minute of dissent,"
15268,343,
15269,343,"and one, long since a pillar of the court,"
15270,343,as mud between the beams thereof is wrought;
15271,343, and one who wrote on phosphates for the crops
15272,343,"is subject-matter of his own report,"
15273,343,
15274,343,these be the glorious ends whereto we pass --
15275,343,"let him who is, go call on him who was;"
15276,343, and he shall see the mallie steals the slab
15277,343,"for currie-grinder, and for goats the grass,"
15278,343,
15279,343,"a breath of wind, a border bullet's flight,"
15280,343,"a draught of water, or a horse's firght --"
15281,343, the droning of the fat sheristadar
15282,343,"ceases, the punkah stops, and falls the night"
15283,343,
15284,343,"for you or me, do those who live decline"
15285,343,"the step that offers, or their work resign?"
15286,343," trust me, to-day's most indispensables,"
15287,343,"five hundred men can take your place or mine,"
15288,344,"how do we know, by the bank-high river,"
15289,344," where the mired and sulky oxen wait,"
15290,344,"and it looks as though we might wait for ever,"
15291,344, how do we know that the floods abate?
15292,344,there is no change in the current's brawling--
15293,344, louder and harsher the freshet scolds;
15294,344,"yet we can feel she is falling, falling"
15295,344," and the more she threatens the less she holds,"
15296,344,"down to the drift, with no word spoken,"
15297,344," the wheel-chained wagons slither and slue,,"
15298,344,achtung! the back of the worst is broken!
15299,344, and--lash your leaders!--we're through--we're through!
15300,344,
15301,344,"how do we know, when the port-fog holds us"
15302,344," moored and helpless, a mile from the pier,"
15303,344,and the week-long summer smother enfolds us--
15304,344, how do we know it is going to clear?
15305,344,"there is no break in the blindfold weather,"
15306,344," but, one and another, about the bay,"
15307,344,"the unseen capstans clink together,"
15308,344," getting ready to up and away,"
15309,344,a pennon whimpers--the breeze has found us--
15310,344," a headsail jumps through the thinning haze,"
15311,344,"the whole hull follows, till--broad around us--"
15312,344," the clean-swept ocean says, go your ways!"
15313,344,
15314,344,"how do we know, when the long fight rages,"
15315,344," on the old, stale front that we cannot shake,"
15316,344,"and it looks as though we were locked for ages,"
15317,344, how do we know they are going to break?
15318,344,"there is no lull in the level firing,"
15319,344," nothing has shifted except the sun,"
15320,344,"yet we can feel they are tiring, tiring--"
15321,344," yet we can tell they are ripe to run,"
15322,344,"something wavers, and, while we wonder,"
15323,344," their centre-trenches are emptying out,"
15324,344,"and, before their useless flanks go under,"
15325,344, our guns have pounded retreat to rout!
15326,345,"as watchers couched beneath a bantine oak,"
15327,345," hearing the dawn-wind stir,"
15328,345,know that the present strength of night is broke
15329,345, though no dawn threaten her
15330,345,"till dawn's appointed hour--so virgil died,"
15331,345," aware of change at hand, and prophesied"
15332,345,
15333,345,change upon all the eternal gods had made
15334,345, and on the gods alike--
15335,345,"fated as dawn but, as the dawn, delayed"
15336,345, till the just hour should strike--
15337,345,
15338,345,a star new-risen above the living and dead;
15339,345, and the lost shades that were our loves restored
15340,345,"as lovers, and for ever, so he said;"
15341,345," having received the word,"
15342,345,
15343,345,"maecenas waits me on the esquiline,"
15344,345," thither to-night go i,,"
15345,345,"and shall this dawn restore us, virgil mine"
15346,345, to dawn? beneath what sky?
15347,346,"there were thirty million english who talked of england's might,"
15348,346,"there were twenty broken troopers who lacked a bed for the night,"
15349,346,"they had neither food nor money, they had neither service nor trade;"
15350,346,"they were only shiftless soldiers, the last of the light brigade,"
15351,346,
15352,346,"they felt that life was fleeting; they knew not that art was long,"
15353,346,"that though they were dying of famine, they lived in deathless song,"
15354,346,they asked for a little money to keep the wolf from the door;
15355,346,and the thirty million english sent twenty pounds and four!
15356,346,
15357,346,they laid their heads together that were scarred and lined and grey;
15358,346,"keen were the russian sabres, but want was keener than they;"
15359,346,"and an old troop-sergeant muttered, let us go to the man who writes"
15360,346,"the things on balaclava the kiddies at school recites,"
15361,346,
15362,346,"they went without bands or colours, a regiment ten-file strong,"
15363,346,to look for the master-singer who had crowned them all in his song;
15364,346,"and, waiting his servant's order, by the garden gate they stayed,"
15365,346,"a desolate little cluster, the last of the light brigade,"
15366,346,
15367,346,"they strove to stand to attention, to straighten the toil-bowed back;"
15368,346,"they drilled on an empty stomach, the loose-knit files fell slack;"
15369,346,"with stooping of weary shoulders, in garments tattered and frayed,"
15370,346,"they shambled into his presence, the last of the light brigade,"
15371,346,
15372,346,"the old troop-sergeant was spokesman, and beggin' your pardon, he said,"
15373,346,"you wrote o' the light brigade, sir, here's all that isn't dead,"
15374,346,"an' it's all come true what you wrote, sir, regardin' the mouth of hell;"
15375,346,"for we're all of us nigh to the workhouse, an, we thought we'd call an' tell,"
15376,346,
15377,346,"no, thank you, we don't want food, sir; but couldn't you take an' write"
15378,346,a sort of 'to be continued' and 'see next page' o' the fight?
15379,346,"we think that someone has blundered, an' couldn't you tell 'em how?"
15380,346,"you wrote we were heroes once, sir, please, write we are starving now,"
15381,346,
15382,346,"the poor little army departed, limping and lean and forlorn,"
15383,346,"and the heart of the master-singer grew hot with the scorn of scorn,"
15384,346,"and he wrote for them wonderful verses that swept the land like flame,"
15385,346,"till the fatted souls of the english were scourged with the thing called shame,"
15386,346,
15387,346,"o thirty million english that babble of england's might,"
15388,346,behold there are twenty heroes who lack their food to-night;
15389,346,our children's children are lisping to honour the charge they made-
15390,346,and we leave to the streets and the workhouse the charge of the light brigade!
15391,347,"the king has called for priest and cup,"
15392,347,the king has taken spur and blade
15393,347,"to dub true thomas a belted knight,"
15394,347,"and all for the sake o' the songs he made,"
15395,347,
15396,347,"they have sought him high, they have sought him low,"
15397,347,they have sought him over down and lea;
15398,347,they have found him by the milk-white thorn
15399,347,"that guards the gates o' faerie,"
15400,347,
15401,347,"    'twas bent beneath and blue above,"
15402,347,      their eyes were held that they might not see
15403,347,"    the kine that grazed beneath the knowes,"
15404,347,"      oh, they were the queens o' faerie!"
15405,347,
15406,347,"now cease your song, the king he said,"
15407,347,"oh, cease your song and get you dight"
15408,347,"to vow your vow and watch your arms,"
15409,347,"for i will dub you a belted knight,"
15410,347,
15411,347,"for i will give you a horse o' pride,"
15412,347,wi' blazon and spur and page and squire;
15413,347,"wi' keep and tail and seizin and law,"
15414,347,"and land to hold at your desire,"
15415,347,
15416,347,"true thomas smiled above his harp,"
15417,347,"and turned his face to the naked sky,"
15418,347,"where, blown before the wastrel wind,"
15419,347,"the thistle-down she floated by,"
15420,347,
15421,347,"i ha' vowed my vow in another place,"
15422,347,"and bitter oath it was on me,"
15423,347,"i ha' watched my arms the lee-long night,"
15424,347,"where five-score fighting men would flee,"
15425,347,
15426,347,"my lance is tipped o' the hammered flame,"
15427,347,my shield is beat o' the moonlight cold;
15428,347,"and i won my spurs in the middle world,"
15429,347,"a thousand fathom beneath the mould,"
15430,347,
15431,347,"and what should i make wi' a horse o' pride,"
15432,347,"and what should i make wi' a sword so brown,"
15433,347,but spill the rings o' the gentle folk
15434,347,and flyte my kin in the fairy town?
15435,347,
15436,347,"and what should i make wi' blazon and belt,"
15437,347,"wi' keep and tail and seizin and fee,"
15438,347,and what should i do wi' page and squire
15439,347,that am a king in my own countrie?
15440,347,
15441,347,"for i send east and i send west,"
15442,347,"and i send far as my will may flee,"
15443,347,"by dawn and dusk and the drinking rain,"
15444,347,"and syne my sendings return to me,"
15445,347,
15446,347,"they come wi' news of the groanin' earth,"
15447,347,"they come wi' news o' the roarin' sea,"
15448,347,"wi' word of spirit and ghost and flesh,"
15449,347,"and man, that's mazed among the three,"
15450,347,
15451,347,"the king he bit his nether lip,"
15452,347,"and smote his hand upon his knee,"
15453,347,"by the faith o' my soul, true thomas, he said,"
15454,347,ye waste no wit in courtesie!
15455,347,
15456,347,"as i desire, unto my pride,"
15457,347,"can i make earls by three and three,"
15458,347,to run before and ride behind
15459,347,"and serve the sons o' my body,"
15460,347,
15461,347,"and what care i for your row-foot earls,"
15462,347,or all the sons o' your body?
15463,347,"before they win to the pride o' name,"
15464,347,"i trow they all ask leave o' me,"
15465,347,
15466,347,"for i make honour wi' muckle mouth,"
15467,347,"as i make shame wi' mincin' feet,"
15468,347,"to sing wi' the priests at the market-cross,"
15469,347,"or run wi' the dogs in the naked street,"
15470,347,
15471,347,"and some they give me the good red gold,"
15472,347,"and some they give me the white money,"
15473,347,"and some they give me a clout o' meal,"
15474,347,"for they be people o' low degree,"
15475,347,
15476,347,and the song i sing for the counted gold
15477,347,"the same i sing for the white money,"
15478,347,but best i sing for the clout o' meal
15479,347,"that simple people given me,"
15480,347,
15481,347,"the king cast down a silver groat,"
15482,347,"a silver groat o' scots money,"
15483,347,"if i come wi' a poor man's dole, he said,"
15484,347,"true thomas, will ye harp to me?"
15485,347,
15486,347,"whenas i harp to the children small,"
15487,347,"they press me close on either hand,"
15488,347,"and who are you, true thomas said,"
15489,347,that you should ride while they must stand?
15490,347,
15491,347,"light down, light down from your horse o' pride,"
15492,347,"i trow ye talk too loud and hie,"
15493,347,"and i will make you a triple word,"
15494,347,"and syne, if ye dare, ye shall 'noble me,"
15495,347,
15496,347,"he has lighted down from his horse o' pride,"
15497,347,"and set his back against the stone,"
15498,347,"now guard you well, true thomas said,"
15499,347,ere i rax your heart from your breast-bone!
15500,347,
15501,347,"true thomas played upon his harp,"
15502,347,"the fairy harp that couldna lee,"
15503,347,"and the first least word the proud king heard,"
15504,347,"it harpit the salt tear out o' his ee,"
15505,347,
15506,347,"oh, i see the love that i lost long syne,"
15507,347,"i touch the hope that i may not see,"
15508,347,"and all that i did o' hidden shame,"
15509,347,"like little snakes they hiss at me,"
15510,347,
15511,347,the sun is lost at noon -- at noon!
15512,347,"the dread o' doom has grippit me,"
15513,347,"true thomas, hide me under your cloak,"
15514,347,"god wot, i'm little fit to dee!"
15515,347,
15516,347,    'twas bent beneath and blue above --
15517,347,      'twas open field and running flood --
15518,347,"    where, hot on heath and dike and wall,"
15519,347,"      the high sun warmed the adder's brood,"
15520,347,
15521,347,"lie down, lie down, true thomas said,"
15522,347,"the god shall judge when all is done,"
15523,347,but i will bring you a better word
15524,347,"and lift the cloud that i laid on,"
15525,347,
15526,347,"true thomas played upon his harp,"
15527,347,"that birled and brattled to his hand,"
15528,347,"and the next least word true thomas made,"
15529,347,"it garred the king take horse and brand,"
15530,347,
15531,347,"oh, i hear the tread o' the fighting men,"
15532,347,"i see the sun on splent and spear,"
15533,347,i mark the arrow outen the fern
15534,347,that flies so low and sings so clear!
15535,347,
15536,347,"advance my standards to that war,"
15537,347,and bid my good knights prick and ride;
15538,347,the gled shall watch as fierce a fight
15539,347,as e'er was fought on the border side!
15540,347,
15541,347,"    'twas bent beneath and blue above,"
15542,347,"      'twas nodding grass and naked sky,"
15543,347,"    where, ringing up the wastrel wind,"
15544,347,"      the eyas stooped upon the pie,"
15545,347,
15546,347,"true thomas sighed above his harp,"
15547,347,and turned the song on the midmost string;
15548,347,"and the last least word true thomas made,"
15549,347,"he harpit his dead youth back to the king,"
15550,347,
15551,347,"now i am prince, and i do well"
15552,347,to love my love withouten fear;
15553,347,"to walk wi' man in fellowship,"
15554,347,"and breathe my horse behind the deer,"
15555,347,
15556,347,"my hounds they bay unto the death,"

15590,348,"not many years ago a king died in one of the rajpoot states, his wives, disregarding the orders of the english against suttee, would have broken out of the palace had not the gates been barred, but one of them, disguised as the king's favourite dancing-girl, passed through the line of guards and reached the pyre,  there, her courage failing, she prayed her cousin, a baron of the court, to kill her,  this he did, not knowing who she was,"

15616,348,and wail upon wail went up to the stars

15650,348,"that he prayed to a flat-nosed lucknow god,"
15651,348,"and kissed the ground where her feet had trod,"

15653,348,"   and swore by her lightest curl,"
15654,348,

15658,348,"on fretted pillar and jewelled screen,"

15669,348,all night the red flame stabbed the sky
15670,348,"   with wavering wind-tossed spears,"
15671,348,and out of a shattered temple crept
15672,348,"a woman who veiled her head and wept,"
15673,348,"and called on the king -- but the great king slept,"
15674,348,"   and turned not for her tears,"
15675,348,
15676,348,small thought had he to mark the strife --
15677,348,   cold fear with hot desire --
15678,348,"when thrice she leaped from the leaping flame,"
15679,348,"and thrice she beat her breast for shame,"
15680,348,and thrice like a wounded dove she came
15681,348,"   and moaned about the fire,"

15683,348,"one watched, a bow-shot from the blaze,"
15684,348,"   the silent streets between,"
15685,348,"who had stood by the king in sport and fray,"
15686,348,"to blade in ambush or boar at bay,"

15690,348,"he said,  o shameless, put aside"
15691,348,   the veil upon thy brow!

15693,348,to the wanton will of a harlot's hand!
15694,348,will the white ash rise from the blistered brand?

15702,348,"   while the others howl in hell,"
15703,348,

15707,348,to sully the steel of a thakur's sword
15708,348,"with base-born blood of a trade abhorred, --"
15709,348,"   and the thakur answered, ay,"
15710,348,
15711,348,"he drew and struck,  the straight blade drank"
15712,348,"   the life beneath the breast,"

15715,348,"sister of mine, pass, free from shame,"

15717,348,
15718,348,"the black log crashed above the white,"
15719,348,"   the little flames and lean,"
15720,348,"red as slaughter and blue as steel,"
15721,348,"that whistled and fluttered from head to heel,"

15761,350,"the four archangels, so the legends tell,"
15762,350,"raphael, gabriel, michael, azrael,"
15763,350,being first of those to whom the power was shown
15764,350,"stood first of all the host before the throne,"
15765,350,"and, when the charges were allotted, burst"
15766,350,"tumultuous-winged from out the assembly first,"
15767,350,zeal was their spur that bade them strictly heed
15768,350,"their own high judgment on their lightest deed,"
15769,350,"zeal was their spur that, when relief was given,"
15770,350,urged them unwearied to new toils in heaven;    
15771,350,for honour's sake perfecting every task
15772,350,"beyond what e 'en perfection's self could ask,   ,   ,"
15773,350,"and allah, who created zeal and pride,"
15774,350,"knows how the twain are perilous-near allied,"
15775,350,
15776,350,"it chanced on one of heaven's long-lighted days,"
15777,350,the four and all the host being gone their ways
15778,350,"each to his charge, the shining courts were void"
15779,350,"save for one seraph whom no charge employed,"
15780,350,"with folden wings and slumber-threatened brow,"
15781,350,"to whom the word,  beloved, what dost thou?"
15782,350,"by the permission, came the answer soft,"
15783,350,"little i do nor do that little oft,"
15784,350,as is the will in heaven so on earth
15785,350,where by the will i strive to make men mirth
15786,350,"he ceased and sped, hearing the word once more,"
15787,350," beloved, go thy way and greet the four,"
15788,350,
15789,350,"systems and universes overpast,"
15790,350,"the seraph came upon the four, at last,"
15791,350,guiding and guarding with devoted mind
15792,350,the tedious generations of mankind
15793,350,who lent at most unwilling ear and eye
15794,350,"when they could not escape the ministry,   ,   ,   ,"
15795,350,"yet, patient, faithful, firm, persistent, just"
15796,350,"toward all that gross, indifferent, facile dust,"
15797,350,the archangels laboured to discharge their trust
15798,350,"by precept and example, prayer and law,"
15799,350,"advice, reproof, and rule, but, labouring, saw"
15800,350,"each in his fellows' countenance confessed,"
15801,350,"the doubt that sickens, have i done my best?"
15802,350,
15803,350,"even as they sighed and turned to toil anew,"
15804,350,the seraph hailed them with observance due;
15805,350,"and, after some fit talk of higher things,"
15806,350,"touched tentative on mundane happenings,"
15807,350,"this they permitting, he, emboldened thus,"
15808,350,"prolused of humankind promiscuous,"
15809,350,"and, since the large contention less avails"
15810,350,"than instances observed, he told them tales--"
15811,350,"tales of the shop, the bed, the court, the street,"
15812,350,"intimate, elemental, indiscreet,"
15813,350,occasions where confusion smiting swift
15814,350,piles jest on jest as snow-slides pile the drift
15815,350,"whence, one by one, beneath derisive skies,"
15816,350,"the victims' bare, bewildered heads arise--"
15817,350,"tales of the passing of the spirit, graced"
15818,350,with humour blinding as the doom it faced--
15819,350,stark tales of ribaldy that broke aside
15820,350,"to tears, by laughter swallowed ere they dried-"
15821,350,"tales to which neither grace nor gain accrue,"
15822,350,"but only allah be exalted! true,"
15823,350,"and only, as the seraph showed that night,"
15824,350,"delighting to the limits of delight,"
15825,350,
15826,350,"these he rehearsed with artful pause and halt,"
15827,350,"and such pretence of memory at fault,"
15828,350,that soon the four--so well the bait was thrown--
15829,350,came to his aid with memories of their own--
15830,350,"matters dismissed long since as small or vain,"
15831,350,whereof the high significance had lain
15832,350,"hid, till the ungirt glosses made it plain,"
15833,350,"then, as enlightenment came broad and fast,"
15834,350,each marvelled at his own oblivious past
15835,350,until--the gates of laughter opened wide--
15836,350,"the four, with that bland seraph at their side,"
15837,350,"while they recalled, compared, and amplified,"
15838,350,in utter mirth forgot both zeal and pride!
15839,350,
15840,350,high over heaven the lamps of midnight  burned
15841,350,"ere, weak with merriment, the four returned,"
15842,350,not in that order they were wont to keep--
15843,350,"pinion to pinion answering, sweep for sweep,"
15844,350,in awful diapason heard afar--
15845,350,but shoutingly adrift 'twixt star and star;
15846,350,reeling a planet's orbit left or right
15847,350,as laughter took them in the abysmal night;
15848,350,"or, by the point of some remembered jest,"
15849,350,"winged and brought helpless down through gulfs unguessed,"
15850,350,where the blank worlds that gather to the birth
15851,350,"leaped in the womb of darkness at their mirth,"
15852,350,"and e'en gehenna's bondsmen understood,"
15853,350,"they were not damned from human brotherhood   ,   ,   ,"
15854,350,
15855,350,"not first nor last of heaven's high host, the four"
15856,350,"that night took place beneath the throne once more,"
15857,350,"0 lovelier than their morning majesty,"
15858,350,the understanding light behind the eye!
15859,350,"0 more compelling than their old command,"
15860,350,the new-learned friendly gesture of the hand!
15861,350,"0 sweeter than their zealous fellowship,"
15862,350,the wise half-smile that passed from lip to lip!
15863,350,"0 well and roundly, when command was given,"
15864,350,"they told their tale against themselves to heaven,"
15865,350,"and in the silence, waiting on the word,"
15866,350,received the peace and pardon of the lord!

15901,351,turned the two-lakh hospital into a superb zenana;

15944,352,they would come up to the forest
15945,352,"and set us to labour too,"

15980,353,
15981,353,"not on a single issue, or in one direction or twain,"

16003,353,"which faithfully mirrored its makers' ideals, equipment, and"
16004,353,    mental attitude--

16006,353,"    gratitude,"
16007,353,
16008,353,we have spent two hundred million pounds to prove the fact

16010,353,"that horses are quicker than men afoot, since two and two"
16011,353,    make four;

16013,353,"    into four goes twice,"

16022,353,    us--
16023,353,have felt the effects of the lesson we got-an advantage no
16024,353,    money could by us!
16025,353,
16026,353,then let us develop  this marvellous  asset which we alone
16027,353,"    command,"
16028,353,"and which, it may subsequently transpire, will be worth as"
16029,353,"    much as the rand,"
16030,353,let us approach this pivotal fact in a humble yet hopeful
16031,353,    mood--
16032,353,"we have had no end of a lesson, it will do us no end of good!"
16033,353,
16034,353,"it was our fault, and our very great fault--and now we must"

16036,353,"we have forty million reasons for failure,  but not a single"
16037,353,"    excuse,"
16038,353,so the more we work and the less we talk the better results
16039,353,    we shall get--
16040,353,we have had an imperial lesson; it may make us an empire
16041,353,    yet!
16042,354,so we settled it all when the storm was done
16043,354,as comfy as comfy could be;
16044,354,"and i was to wait in the barn, my dears,"
16045,354,"because i was only three,"
16046,354,and teddy would run to the rainbow's foot

16049,354,and that's how it all began!
16050,354,
16051,354,then we brought the lances down--then the trumpets blew--

16064,354,"and he bayed to the moon as she rose,"
16065,354,
16066,354,"i have a thousand men, said he,"

16956,369,"         that knows but cannot understand,"
16957,369,
16958,369,"       and when the roaring hillside broke,"
16959,369,"         and all our world fell down in rain,"
16960,369,"       we saved him, we the little folk;"
16961,369,         but lo! he does not come again!
16962,369,
16963,369,"      mourn now, we saved him for the sake"
16964,369,"        of such poor love as wild ones may,"
16965,369,"      mourn ye! our brother will not wake,"
16966,369,        and his own kind drive us away!
16967,370,i sent a message to my dear --
16968,370,a thousand leagues and more to her --
16969,370,"the dumb sea-levels thrilled to hear,"
16970,370,"and lost atlantis bore to her,"
16971,370,
16972,370,"behind my message hard i came,"
16973,370,and nigh had found a grave for me;
16974,370,but that i launched of steel and flame
16975,370,"did war against the wave for me,"
16976,370,
16977,370,"uprose the deep, by gale on gale,"
16978,370,to bid me change my mind again --
16979,370,"he broke his teeth along my rail,"
16980,370,"and, roaring, swung behind again,"
16981,370,
16982,370,i stayed the sun at noon to tell
16983,370,my way across the waste of it;
16984,370,i read the storm before it fell
16985,370,"and made the better haste of it,"
16986,370,
16987,370,"afar, i hailed the land at night --"
16988,370,the towers i built had heard of me --
16989,370,"and, ere my rocket reached its height,"
16990,370,"had flashed my love the word of me,"
16991,370,
16992,370,earth sold her chosen men of strength
16993,370,they lived and strove and died for me
16994,370,"to drive my road a nation's length,"
16995,370,"and toss the miles aside for me,"
16996,370,
16997,370,i snatched their toil to serve my needs --
16998,370,too slow their fleetest flew for me --
16999,370,"i tired twenty smoking steeds,"
17000,370,"and bade them bait a new for me,"
17001,370,
17002,370,i sent the lightnings forth to see
17003,370,"where hour by hour she waited me,"
17004,370,"among ten million one was she,"
17005,370,and surely all men hated me!
17006,370,
17007,370,dawn ran to meet me at my goal --
17008,370,"ah, day no tongue shall tell again!"
17009,370,and little folk of little soul
17010,370,rose up to buy and sell again!
17011,371,"beneath the deep veranda's shade,"
17012,371," when bats begin to fly,"
17013,371,i sit me down and watch -- alas! --
17014,371," another evening die,"
17015,371,blood-red behind the sere ferash
17016,371," she rises through the haze,"
17017,371,sainted diana! can that be
17018,371, the moon of other days?
17019,371,
17020,371,"ah! shade of little kitty smith,"
17021,371, sweet saint of kensington!
17022,371,"say, was it ever thus at home"
17023,371," the moon of august shone,"
17024,371,when arm in arm we wandered long
17025,371," through putney's evening haze,"
17026,371,and hammersmith was heaven beneath
17027,371, the moon of other days?
17028,371,
17029,371,"but wandle's stream is sutlej now,"
17030,371, and putney's evening haze
17031,371,the dust that half a hundered kine
17032,371," before my window raise,"
17033,371,"unkempt, unclean, athwart the mist"
17034,371," the seething city looms,"
17035,371,in place of putney's golden gorse
17036,371," the sickly babul blooms,"
17037,371,
17038,371,"glare down, old hecate, through the dust,"
17039,371," and bid the pie-dog yell,"
17040,371,"draw from the drain its typhoid-term,"
17041,371, from each bazaar its smell;
17042,371,"yea, suck the fever from the tank"
17043,371," and sap my strength therewith,"
17044,371,"thank heaven, you show a smiling face"
17045,371, to little kitty smith!
17046,372,one moment past our bodies cast
17047,372, no shadow on the plain;
17048,372,"now clear and black they stride our track,"
17049,372," and we run home again,"
17050,372,"in morning-hush, each rock and bush"
17051,372," stands hard, and high, and raw,"
17052,372,"then give the call,  good rest to all"
17053,372, that keep the jungle law!
17054,372,
17055,372,now horn and pelt our peoples melt
17056,372, in covert to abide;
17057,372,"now, crouched and still, to cave and hill"
17058,372," our jungle barons glide,"
17059,372,"now, stark and plain, man's oxen strain,"
17060,372, that draw the new-yoked plough;
17061,372,"now, stripped and dread, the dawn is red"
17062,372," above the lit talao,"
17063,372,
17064,372,ho! get to lair! the sun's aflare
17065,372," behind the breathing grass,"
17066,372,and creaking through the young bamboo
17067,372," the warning whispers pass,"
17068,372,"by day made strange, the woods we range"
17069,372, with blinking eyes we scan;
17070,372,"while down the skies the wild duck cries,"
17071,372, the day--the day to man!
17072,372,
17073,372,"the dew is dried that drenched our hide,"
17074,372, or washed about our way;
17075,372,"and where we drank, the puddled bank"
17076,372," is crisping into clay,"
17077,372,the traitor dark gives up each mark
17078,372," of stretched or hooded claw,"
17079,372,"then hear the call, good rest to all"
17080,372, that keep the jungle law!
17081,373,i have a dream -- a dreadful dream --
17082,373," a dream that is never done,"
17083,373,"i watch a man go out of his mind,"
17084,373," and he is my mother's son,"
17085,373,
17086,373,"they pushed him into a mental home,"
17087,373," and that is like the grave,"
17088,373,"for they do not let you sleep upstairs,"
17089,373," and you aren't allowed to shave,"
17090,373,
17091,373,and it was not disease or crime
17092,373," which got him landed there,"
17093,373,but because they laid on my mother's son
17094,373," more than a man could bear,"
17095,373,
17096,373,"what with noise, and fear of death,"
17097,373," waking, and wounds and cold,"
17098,373,they filled the cup for my mother's son
17099,373," fuller than it could hold,"
17100,373,
17101,373,they broke his body and his mind
17102,373," and yet they made him live,"
17103,373,and they asked more of my mother's son
17104,373," than any man could give,"
17105,373,
17106,373,"for, just because he had not died,"
17107,373," nor been discharged nor sick,"
17108,373,they dragged it out with my mother's son
17109,373," longer than he could stick,,"
17110,373,
17111,373,and no one knows when he'll get well --
17112,373," so, there he'll have to be,"
17113,373,"and, 'spite of the beard in the looking-glass,"
17114,373,  i know that man is me!
17115,374,"there was rundle, station master,"

17198,375,    we learned from our wistful mothers
17199,375,      to call old england home;

17201,375,"      of the spring in the english lanes,"
17202,375,    but we screamed with the painted lories
17203,375,      as we rode on the dusty plains!
17204,375,
17205,375,    they passed with their old-world legends --
17206,375,      their tales of wrong and dearth --

17208,375,      but we by the right of birth;

17682,382, in the night that it made around you!
17683,382,
17684,382,"all these things i know, i know,"
17685,382, and that's why my heart is breaking!
17686,382,then what do you gain by pretending so?
17687,382,"the joy of an old wound waking,"
17688,383,"she dropped the bar, she shot the bolt, she fed the fire anew"
17689,383,"  for she heard  a whimper under the  sill  and  a  great grey paw came through,"
17690,383,"  the fresh flame comforted the hut and shone on the roof-beam,"
17691,383,"  and the only son lay down again and dreamed that he dreamed a dream,"
17692,383,"  the last ash fell from the withered log with the click of a falling spark,"
17693,383,"  and the only son woke up again, and called across the dark,--"
17694,383,  now was i born of womankind and laid in a mother's breast?
17695,383,"  for i have dreamed of a shaggy hide whereon i went to rest,"
17696,383,  and was i born of womankind and laid on a father's arm?
17697,383,"  for i have dreamed of clashing teeth that guarded me from harm,"
17698,383,
17699,383,  and was i born an only son and did i play alone?
17700,383,"  for i have dreamed of comrades twain that bit me to the bone,"
17701,383,  and did i break the barley-cake and steep it in the tyre?
17702,383,"  for i have dreamed of a youngling kid new-riven from the byre,"
17703,383,  for i  have  dreamed  of a midnight sky  and  a  midnight call to blood
17704,383,"  and red-mouthed shadows racing by, that thrust me from my food,"
17705,383,"  'tis an hour yet and an hour yet to the rising of the moon,"
17706,383,"  but i can see the black roof-tree as plain as it were noon,"
17707,383,  'tis a league and a league to the lena falls where the trooping blackbuck go;
17708,383,"  but i can hear the little fawn that bleats behind the doe,"
17709,383,
17710,383,"  'tis a league and a league to the lena falls where the crop and the upland meet,"
17711,383,"  but i can smell the  wet dawn-wind  that wakes  the sprouting wheat,"
17712,383,"  unbar the door, i may not bide, but i must out and see"
17713,383,  if those are wolves that wait outside or my own kin to me!
17714,383,"        ,                 ,                    ,                ,             ,"
17715,383,"  she loosed the bar,  she slid the bolt, she opened the door anon,"
17716,383,  and a grey bitch-wolf came out of the dark and fawned on the only son!
17717,384,"when the earth was sick and the skies were grey,"
17718,384,"and the woods were rotted with rain,"
17719,384,the dead man rode through the autumn day
17720,384,"to visit his love again,"
17721,384,
17722,384,"his love she neither saw nor heard,"
17723,384,so heavy was her shame;
17724,384,and tho' the babe within her stirred
17725,384,"she knew not that he came,"
17726,385,through learned and laborious years
17727,385, they set themselves to find
17728,385,fresh terrors and undreamed-of fears
17729,385," to heap upon mankind,"
17730,385,
17731,385,all that they drew from heaven above
17732,385," or digged from earth beneath,"
17733,385,they laid into their treasure-trove
17734,385," and arsenals of death,"
17735,385,
17736,385,"while, for well-weighed advantage sake,"
17737,385, ruler and ruled alike
17738,385,built up the faith they meant to break
17739,385," when the fit hour should strike,"
17740,385,
17741,385,"they traded with the careless earth,"
17742,385," and good return it gave,"
17743,385,they plotted by their neighbour's hearth
17744,385," the means to make him slave,"
17745,385,
17746,385,when all was ready to their hand
17747,385," they loosed their hidden sword,"
17748,385,and utterly laid waste a land
17749,385," their oath was pledged to guard,"
17750,385,
17751,385,coldly they went about to raise
17752,385, to life and make more dread
17753,385,"abominations of old days,"
17754,385," that men believed were dead,"
17755,385,
17756,385,they paid the price to reach their goal
17757,385, across a world in flame;
17758,385,but their own hate slew their own soul
17759,385," before that victory came,"
17760,386,"in the name of the empress of india, make way,"
17761,386," o lords of the jungle, wherever you roam,"
17762,386,the woods are astir at the close of the day --
17763,386," we exiles are waiting for letters from home,"
17764,386,let the robber retreat -- let the tiger turn tail --
17765,386,"in the name of the empress, the overland mail!"
17766,386,
17767,386,"with a jingle of bells as the dusk gathers in,"
17768,386, he turns to the foot-path that heads up the hill --
17769,386,"the bags on his back and a cloth round his chin,"
17770,386," and, tucked in his waist-belt, the post office bill,"
17771,386,"dispatched on this date, as received by the rail,"
17772,386,"per runner, two bags of the overland mail,"
17773,386,
17774,386,"is the torrent in spate? he must ford it or swim,"
17775,386," has the rain wrecked the road? he must climb by the cliff,"
17776,386,does the tempest cry halt? what are tempests to him?
17777,386," the service admits not a but or and if,"
17778,386,"while the breath's in his mouth, he must bear without fail,"
17779,386,"in the name of the empress, the overland mail,"
17780,386,
17781,386,"from aloe to rose-oak, from rose-oak to fir,"
17782,386," from level to upland, from upland to crest,"
17783,386,"from rice-field to rock-ridge, from rock-ridge to spur,"
17784,386," fly the soft sandalled feet, strains the brawny brown chest,"
17785,386,from rail to ravine -- to the peak from the vale --
17786,386,"up, up through the night goes the overland mail,"
17787,386,
17788,386,"there's a speck on the hillside, a dot on the road --"
17789,386, a jingle of bells on the foot-path below --
17790,386,there's a scuffle above in the monkey's abode --
17791,386," the world is awake, and the clouds are aglow,"
17792,386,"for the great sun himself must attend to the hail,"
17793,386,in the name of the empress the overland mail!
17794,387,when i was a king and a mason -- a master proven and skilled --
17795,387,"i cleared me ground for a palace such as a king should build,"
17796,387,"i decreed and dug down to my levels, presently, under the silt,"
17797,387,"i came on the wreck of a palace such as a king had built,"
17798,387,
17799,387,there was no worth in the fashion -- there was no wit in the plan --
17800,387,"hither and thither, aimless, the ruined footings ran --"
17801,387,"masonry, brute, mishandled, but carven on every stone,"
17802,387,"after me cometh a builder, tell him, i too have known,"
17803,387,
17804,387,"swift to my use in my trenches, where my well-planned ground-works grew,"
17805,387,"i tumbled his quoins and his ashlars, and cut and reset them anew,"
17806,387,"lime i milled of his marbles; burned it, slacked it, and spread;"
17807,387,"taking and leaving at pleasure the gifts of the humble dead,"
17808,387,
17809,387,"yet i despised not nor gloried; yet, as we wrenched them apart,"
17810,387,"i read in the razed foundations the heart of that builder's heart,"
17811,387,"as he had risen and pleaded, so did i understand"
17812,387,"the form of the dream he had followed in the face of the thing he had planned,"
17813,387,
17814,387,"when i was a king and a mason -- in the open noon of my pride,"
17815,387,"they sent me a word from the darkness, they whispered and called me aside,"
17816,387,"they said -- the end is forbidden, they said -- thy use is fulfilled,"
17817,387,"thy palace shall stand as that other's -- the spoil of a king who shall build,"
17818,387,
17819,387,"i called my men from my trenches, my quarries, my wharves, and my sheers,"
17820,387,"all i had wrought i abandoned to the faith of the faithless years,"
17821,387,"only i cut on the timber -- only i carved on the stone,"
17822,387,"after me cometh a builder, tell him, i too have known!"
17823,388,"the word came down to dives in torment where he lay,"
17824,388,"our world is full of wickedness, my children maim and slay,"
17825,388, and the saint and seer and prophet
17826,388, can make no better of it
17827,388,"than to sanctify and prophesy and pray,"
17828,388,
17829,388,"rise up, rise up, thou dives, and take again thy gold,"
17830,388,"and thy women and thy housen as they were to thee of old,"
17831,388, it may be grace hath found thee
17832,388," in the furnace where we bound thee,"
17833,388,"and that thou shalt bring the peace my son foretold,"
17834,388,
17835,388,"then merrily rose dives and leaped from out his fire,"
17836,388,and walked abroad with diligence to do the lord's desire;
17837,388," and anon the battles ceased,"
17838,388," and the captives were released,"
17839,388,"and earth had rest from goshen to gadire,"
17840,388,
17841,388,"the word came down to satan that raged and roared alone,"
17842,388,'mid the shouring of the peoples by the cannon overthrown
17843,388," but the prophets, saints, and seers"
17844,388," set each other by the ears,"
17845,388,"for each would claim the marvel as his own,"
17846,388,
17847,388,"rise up, rise up, thou satan, upon the earth to go,"
17848,388,"and prove the peace of dives if it be good or no,"
17849,388, for all that he hath planned
17850,388," we deliver to thy hand,"
17851,388,"as thy skill shall serve, to break it or bring low,"
17852,388,
17853,388,"then mightily rose satan, and about the earth he hied,"
17854,388,"and breathed on kings in idleness and princes drunk with pride,"
17855,388, but for all the wrong he breathed
17856,388," there was never sword unsheathed,"
17857,388,"and the fires he lighted flickered out and died,"
17858,388,
17859,388,"then terribly 'rose satan, and darkened earth afar,"
17860,388,till he came on cunning dives where the money-changers are;
17861,388, and he saw men pledge their gear
17862,388," for the bold that buys the spear,"
17863,388,"and the helmet and the habergeon of war,"
17864,388,
17865,388,"yea, to dives came the persian and the syrian and the mede --"
17866,388,"and their hearts were nothing altered, nor their cunning nor their greed --"
17867,388, and they pledged their flocks and farms
17868,388," for the king-compelling arms,"
17869,388,"and dives lent according to their need,"
17870,388,
17871,388,"then satan said to dives, -- return again with me,"
17872,388,"who hast broken his commandment in the day he set thee free,"
17873,388,  who grindest for thy greed
17874,388,"  man's belly-pinch and need,"
17875,388,and the blood of man to filthy usury!
17876,388,
17877,388,"then softly answered dives where the money-changers sit, --"
17878,388,"my refuge is our master, o my master in the pit,"
17879,388, but behold all earth is laid
17880,388," in the peace which i have made,"
17881,388,and behold i wait on thee to trouble it!
17882,388,
17883,388,"then angrily turned satan, and about the seas he fled,"
17884,388,"to shake the new-sown peoples with insult, doubt, and dread;"
17885,388," but, for all the sleight he used,"
17886,388," there was never squadron loosed,"
17887,388,"and the brands he flung flew dying and fell dead,"
17888,388,
17889,388,but to dives came atlantis and the captains of the west --
17890,388,and their hates were nothing weakened nor their angers unrest --
17891,388, and they pawned their utmost trade
17892,388," for the dry, decreeing blade;"
17893,388,"and dives lent and took of them their best,"
17894,388,
17895,388,"then satan said to dives, -- declare thou by the name,"
17896,388,"the secret of thy subtlety that turneth mine to shame,"
17897,388, it is known through all the hells
17898,388," how my peoples mocked my spells,"
17899,388,"and my faithless kings denied me ere i came,"
17900,388,
17901,388,"then answered cunning dives, do not gold and hate abide"
17902,388,"at the heart of every magic, yea, and senseless fear beside?"
17903,388, with gold and fear and hate
17904,388," i have harnessed state to state,"
17905,388,"and by hate and fear and gold their hates are tied,"
17906,388,
17907,388,"for hate men seek a weapon, for fear they seek a shield --"
17908,388,keener blades and broader targets than their frantic neighbours wield --
17909,388," for gold i arm their hands,"
17910,388," and for gold i buy their lands,"
17911,388,"and for gold i sell their enemies the yield,"
17912,388,
17913,388,"their nearest foes may purchase, or their furthest friends may lease,"
17914,388,"one by one from ancient accad to the islands of the seas,"
17915,388, and their covenants they make
17916,388," for the naked iron's sake,"
17917,388,"but i -- i trap them armoured into peace,"
17918,388,
17919,388,"the flocks that egypt pledged me to assyria i drave,"
17920,388,"and pharaoh hath the increase of the herds that sargon gave,"
17921,388, not for ashdod overthrown
17922,388," will the kings destroy their own,"
17923,388,"or their peoples wake the strife they feign to brave,"
17924,388,
17925,388,is not carchemish like calno? for the steeds of their desire
17926,388,they have sold me seven harvests that i sell to crowning tyre;
17927,388, and the tyrian sweeps the plains
17928,388," with a thousand hired wains,"
17929,388,"and the cities keep the peace and -- share the hire,"
17930,388,
17931,388,"hast thou seen the pride of moab?  for the swords about his path,"
17932,388,"his bond is to philistia, in half of all he hath,"
17933,388, and he dare not draw the sword
17934,388," till gaza give the word,"
17935,388,"and he show release from askalon and gath,"
17936,388,
17937,388,"wilt thou call again thy peoples, wilt thou craze anew thy kings?"
17938,388,"lo! my lightnings pass before thee, and their whistling servant brings,"
17939,388," ere the drowsy street hath stirred,"
17940,388," every masked and midnight word,"
17941,388,"and the nations break their fast upon these things,"
17942,388,
17943,388,"so i make a jest of wonder, and a mock of time and space,"
17944,388,"the roofless seas an hostel, and the earth a market-place,"
17945,388, where the anxious traders know
17946,388," each is surety for his foe,"
17947,388,"and none may thrive without his fellows' grace,"
17948,388,
17949,388,"now this is all my subtlety and this is all my wit,"
17950,388,"god give thee good enlightenment, my master in the pit,"
17951,388, but behold all earth is laid
17952,388," in the peace which i have made,"
17953,388,and behold i wait on thee to trouble it!
17954,389,once in life i watched a star;
17955,389," but i whistled, let her go!"
17956,389,"there are others, fairer far,"
17957,389, which my favouring skies shall show
17958,389,"here i lied, and herein i"
17959,389,"stood to pay the penalty,"
17960,389,
17961,389,marvellous the planets shone  
17962,389, as i ranged from coast to coast--
17963,389,but beyond comparison
17964,389," rode the star that i had lost,"
17965,389,"i had lied, and only i"
17966,389,"did not guess the penalty!  ,  ,  ,"
17967,389,
17968,389,"when  my  heavens  were  turned  to  blood,"
17969,389," when the dark had filled my day,"
17970,389,"furthest, but most faithful, stood"
17971,389," that lone star i cast away,"
17972,389,"i had loved myself, and i"
17973,389,have not lived and dare not die!
17974,390,"when rome was rotten-ripe to her fall,"
17975,390,"     and the sceptre passed from her hand,"
17976,390,   the pestilent picts leaped over the wall
17977,390,"     to harry the english land,"
17978,390,
17979,390,"   the little dark men of the mountain and waste,"
17980,390,"     so quick to laughter and tears,"
17981,390,   they came panting with hate and haste
17982,390,"     for the loot of five hundred years,"
17983,390,
17984,390,"   they killed the trader, they sacked the shops,"
17985,390,     they ruined temple and town--
17986,390,   they swept like wolves through the standing crops
17987,390,"     crying that rome was down,"
17988,390,
17989,390,   they wiped out all that they could find
17990,390,"     of beauty and strength and worth,"
17991,390,   but they could not wipe out the viking's wind
17992,390,"     that brings the ships from the north,"
17993,390,
17994,390,   they could not wipe out the north-east gales
17995,390,     nor what those gales set free--
17996,390,"   the pirate ships with their close-reefed sails,"
17997,390,"     leaping from sea to sea,"
17998,390,
17999,390,   they had forgotten the shield-hung hull
18000,390,"     seen nearer and more plain,"
18001,390,"   dipping into the troughs like a gull,"
18002,390,     and gull-like rising again--
18003,390,
18004,390,   the painted eyes that glare and frown
18005,390,"     in the high snake-headed stem,"
18006,390,"   searching the beach while her sail comes down,"
18007,390,     they had forgotten them!
18008,390,
18009,390,   there was no count of the saxon shore
18010,390,"     to meet her hand to hand,"
18011,390,"   as she took the beach with a grind and a roar,"
18012,390,     and the pirates rushed inland!
18013,391,"she is not folly -- that i know,"
18014,391,her steadfast eyelids tell me so
18015,391,"when, at the hour the lights divide,"
18016,391,"she steals as summonsed to my side,"
18017,391,
18018,391,"when, finger on the pursed lip"
18019,391,"in secret, mirthful fellowship,"
18020,391,"she, heralding new -- framed delights,"
18021,391,"breathes, this shall be a night of nights!"
18022,391,
18023,391,"then, out of time and out of space,"
18024,391,is built an hour and a place
18025,391,"where all an earnest, baffled earth"
18026,391,blunders and trips to make us mirth;
18027,391,
18028,391,"whence from the trivial flux of things,"
18029,391,"rise inconceived miscarryings,"
18030,391,"outrageous but immortal, shown,"
18031,391,"of her great love, to me alone,"

18389,401,
18390,401,"these at labour make no sign,"
18391,401," more than planets, tides or years"
18392,401,"which discover god's design,"
18393,401, not our hopes and not our fears;
18394,401,nor in aught they gain or lose
18395,401,"seek a triumph or excuse,"
18396,401,
18397,401,"for, so the ark be borne to zion, who"
18398,401,heeds how they perished or were paid that bore it?
18399,401,"for, so the shrine abide, what shame -- what pride --"
18400,401,"if we, the priests, were bound or crowned before it?"
18401,402,"here come i to my own again,"
18402,402,"fed, forgiven and known again,"
18403,402,claimed by bone of my bone again
18404,402,"and cheered by flesh of my flesh,"
18405,402,"the fatted calf is dressed for me,"
18406,402,"but the husks have greater zest for me,"
18407,402,"i think my pigs will be best for me,"
18408,402,"so i'm off to the yards afresh,"
18409,402,
18410,402,"i never was very refined, you see,"
18411,402,"and it weighs on my brother's mind, you see"
18412,402,"but there's no reproach among swine, d'you see,"
18413,402,"for being a bit of a swine,"
18414,402,so i'm off with wallet and staff to eat
18415,402,"the bread that is three parts chaff to wheat,"
18416,402,"but glory be! - there's a laugh to it,"
18417,402,"which isn't the case when we dine,"
18418,402,
18419,402,"my father glooms and advises me,"
18420,402,"my brother sulks and despises me,"
18421,402,and mother catechises me
18422,402,"till i want to go out and swear,"
18423,402,"and, in spite of the butler's gravity,"
18424,402,i know that the servants have it i
18425,402,"am a monster of moral depravity,"
18426,402,and i'm damned if i think it's fair!
18427,402,
18428,402,"i wasted my substance, i know i did,"
18429,402,"on riotous living, so i did,"
18430,402,but there's nothing on record to show i did
18431,402,"worse than my betters have done,"
18432,402,they talk of the money i spent out there -
18433,402,they hint at the pace that i went out there -
18434,402,but they all forget i was sent out there
18435,402,"alone as a rich man's son,"
18436,402,
18437,402,"so i was a mark for plunder at once,"
18438,402,"and lost my cash can you wonder? at once,"
18439,402,"but i didn't give up and knock under at once,"
18440,402,"i worked in the yards, for a spell,"
18441,402,"where i spent my nights and my days with hogs,"
18442,402,"and shared their milk and maize with hogs,"
18443,402,"till, i guess, i have learned what pays with hogs"
18444,402,and - i have that knowledge to sell!
18445,402,
18446,402,"so back i go to my job again,"
18447,402,"not so easy to rob again,"
18448,402,or quite so ready to sob again
18449,402,"on any neck that's around,"
18450,402,"i'm leaving, pater,  good-bye to you!"
18451,402,"god bless you, mater! i'll write to you!"
18452,402,"i wouldn't be impolite to you,"
18453,402,"but, brother, you are a hound!"
18454,403,"this spark now set, retarded, yet forbears"
18455,403,to hold her light however so he swears
18456,403,"that turns a metalled crank, and leather cloaked,"
18457,403,with some small hammers tappeth hither an yon;
18458,403,
18459,403,peering as when she showeth and when is gone;
18460,403,for wait he must till the vext power's evoked
18461,403,"that's one with the lightnings, wait in the showers soaked;"
18462,403,"or by the road-side sunned, she'll not progress,"
18463,403,"poor soul, here taught how great things may by less"
18464,403,"be stayed, to file contacts doth himself address!"
18465,404,"the celt in all his variants from builth to ballyhoo,"
18466,404,"his mental processes are plain--one knows what he will do,"
18467,404,and can logically predicate his finish by his start;
18468,404,"but the english--ah, the english!--they are quite a race apart,"
18469,404,
18470,404,"their psychology is bovine, their outlook crude and raw,"
18471,404,they abandon vital matters to be tickled with a straw;
18472,404,but the straw that they were tickled with-the chaff that they were fed with--
18473,404,"they convert into a weaver's beam to break their foeman's head with,"
18474,404,
18475,404,"for undemocratic reasons and for motives not of  state,"
18476,404,"they  arrive  at  their  conclusions--largely  inarticulate,"
18477,404,being void of self-expression they confide their views to none;
18478,404,"but sometimes in a smoking-room,  one learns why things were done,"
18479,404,
18480,404,"yes, sometimes in a smoking-room, through clouds of ers an ums,"
18481,404,"obliquely  and by inference,  illumination  comes,"
18482,404,"on some step that they have taken, or some action they approve"
18483,404,"embellished with the argot of the upper fourth remove,"
18484,404,
18485,404,"in telegraphic sentences  half nodded to their friends,"
18486,404,"they hint a matter's inwardness--and there the matter ends,"
18487,404,"and while the celt is talking from valencia to kirkwall,"
18488,404,"the english--ah, the english!--don't say anything at all,"
18489,405,"i have a thousand men, said he,"
18490,405,  to wait upon my will;
18491,405,"and towers nine upon the tyne,"
18492,405,"  and three upon the till,"
18493,405,
18494,405,"and what care i for your men?  said she,"
18495,405,  or towers from tyne to till?
18496,405,"sith you must go with me, said she,"
18497,405,"  to wait upon my will,"
18498,405,
18499,405,and you may lead a thousand men
18500,405,"  nor ever draw the rein,"
18501,405,but before you lead the fairy queen
18502,405,"   'twill burst your heart in twain,"
18503,405,
18504,405," he has slipped his foot from the stirrup-bar,"
18505,405,"   the bridle from his hand,"
18506,405, and he is bound by hand and foot
18507,405,"   to the queen of fairy land,"
18508,406,valour and innocence      
18509,406,   have latterly gone hence
18510,406,"   to certain death by certain shame attended,"
18511,406,   envy--ah! even to tears! --
18512,406,   the fortune of their years
18513,406,"   which, though so few, yet so divinely ended,"
18514,406,
18515,406,   scarce had they lifted up
18516,406,"   life's full and fiery cup,"
18517,406,"   than they had set it down untouched before them,"
18518,406,   before their day arose
18519,406,   they beckoned it to close--
18520,406,"   close in confusion and destruction o'er them,"
18521,406,
18522,406,   they did not stay to ask
18523,406,   what prize should crown their task--
18524,406,   well  sure  that  prize  was  such  as  no  man strives  for;
18525,406,"   but passed into eclipse,"
18526,406,   her kiss upon their lips--
18527,406,"   even belphoebe's, whom they gave their lives for!"
18528,407,"brethren, how shall it fare with me"
18529,407," when the war is laid aside,"
18530,407,if it be proven that i am he
18531,407, for whom a world has died?
18532,407,
18533,407,"if it be proven that all my good,"
18534,407," and the greater good i will make,"
18535,407,were purchased me by a multitude
18536,407, who suffered for my sake?
18537,407,
18538,407,that i was delivered by mere mankind
18539,407," vowed to one sacrifice,"
18540,407,"and not, as i hold them, battle-blind,"
18541,407, but dying with open eyes?
18542,407,
18543,407,that they did not ask me to draw the sword
18544,407, when they stood to endure their lot --
18545,407,"that they only looked to me for a word,"
18546,407, and i answered i knew them not?
18547,407,
18548,407,"if it be found, when the battle clears,"
18549,407," their death has set me free,"

18552,407,
18553,407,"brethren, how must it fare with me,"
18554,407," or how am i justified,"
18555,407,if it be proven that i am he
18556,407, for whom mankind has died --
18557,407,if it be proven that i am he
18558,407," who, being questioned, denied?"
18559,408,"if thought can reach to heaven,"
18560,408," on heaven let it dwell,"
18561,408,for fear the thought be given
18562,408," like power to reach to hell,"
18563,408,for fear the desolation
18564,408, and darkness of thy mind
18565,408,perplex an habitation
18566,408," which thou hast left behind,"
18567,408,
18568,408,let nothing linger after--

18574,408,"on aught thy heirs inherit,"
18575,408," the shadow of her past,"
18576,408,
18577,408,"for think, in all thy sadness,"

18579,408,"whose brain reflect our madness,"
18580,408," or whom our terrors shake,"
18581,408,"for think, lest any languish"
18582,408, by cause of thy distress--
18583,408,the arrows of our anguish
18584,408," fly farther than we guess,"
18585,408,
18586,408,"our lives, our tears, as water,"
18587,408, are spilled upon the ground;

18589,408," yet god a means hath found,"
18590,408,"though faith and hope have vanished,"
18591,408, and even love grows dim--

18618,410,"at runnymede, at runnymede,"
18619,410,  what say the reeds at runnymede?
18620,410,"the lissom reeds that give and take,"
18621,410,"that bend so far, but never break,"
18622,410,they keep the sleepy thames awake
18623,410,"  with tales of john at runnymede,"
18624,410,
18625,410,"at runnymede, at runnymede,"
18626,410,"  oh, hear the reeds at runnymede,--"
18627,410,"you mustn't sell, delay, deny,"
18628,410,"a freeman's right or liberty,"
18629,410,"it makes the stubborn englishry,"

18631,410,
18632,410,"when through our ranks the barons came,"
18633,410,"  with little thought of praise or blame,"
18634,410,"but resolute to pay a game,"
18635,410,they lumbered up to runnymede;
18636,410,and there they launched in solid time
18637,410,the first attack on right divine--
18638,410,"the curt, uncompromising 'sign!'"
18639,410,"  that settled john at runnymede,"
18640,410,
18641,410,"at runnymede, at runnymede,"

18648,410,"  the charter signed at runnymede,"
18649,410,
18650,410,and still when mob or monarch lays
18651,410,"too rude hand on english ways,"
18652,410,"the whisper wakes, the shudder plays,"
18653,410,"  across the reeds at runnymede,"
18654,410,"and tames, that knows the moods of kings,"
18655,410,"and crowds and priests and suchlike things,"
18656,410,rolls deep and dreadful as he brings

18658,411,not in the camp his victory lies
18659,411," or triumph in the market-place,"

18769,412,but reachin' out to all the rest!
18770,412,
18771,412,"so 'ath it come to me--not pride,"
18772,412,"nor yet conceit, but on the 'ole"
18773,412,"if such a term may be applied,"
18774,412,"the makin's of a bloomin' soul,"
18775,412,"but now, discharged, i fall away"
18776,412,"to do with little things again,,"
18777,412,"gawd, 'oo knows all i cannot say,"
18778,412,look after me in thamesfontein!
18779,412,
18780,412,if england was what england seems
18781,412,"an' not the england of our dreams,"
18782,412,"but only putty, brass, an' paint,"
18783,412,'ow quick we'd chuck 'er! but she ain't!
18784,413,"neither the harps nor the crowns amused, nor the cherubs' dove-winged races--"
18785,413,"holding hands forlornly the children wandered beneath the dome,"
18786,413,"plucking the splendid robes  of the  passers-by,  and with pitiful! faces"
18787,413,"begging what princes and powers refused,--ah, please will you let us go home?"
18788,413,
18789,413,"over the jewelled floor, nigh weeping, ran to them mary the mother,"
18790,413,"kneeled and caressed and made promise with kisses, and drew them along to the gateway--"
18791,413,"yea, the all-iron unbribeable door which peter must guard and none other,"
18792,413,"straightway she took the keys from his keeping, and opened and freed them straightway,"
18793,413,
18794,413,"then, to her son, who had seen and smiled,  she said,  on the night that i bore thee,  "
18795,413,what didst thou care for a love beyond mine or a heaven that was not my arm?
18796,413,"didst thou push from the nipple, o child,  to hear the angels adore thee"
18797,413,"when we two lay in the breath of the kine? and he said -- thou hast done no harm,"
18798,413,
18799,413,"so through the void the children ran homeward merrily hand in hand,"
18800,413,"looking neither to left nor right where the breathless heavens stood still,"
18801,413,"and the guards of the void resheathed their swords, for they heard the command,"
18802,413,shall i that have suffered the children to come to me hold them against their will?
18803,414,", , , at the close of a winter day,"
18804,414,"their anchors down, by london town, the three great captains lay;"
18805,414,"and one was admiral of the north from solway firth to skye,"
18806,414,"and one was lord of the wessex coast and all the lands thereby,"
18807,414,"and one was master of the thames from limehouse to blackwall,"
18808,414,"and he was captain of the fleet -- the bravest of them all,"
18809,414,their good guns guarded their great gray sides
18810,414," that were thirty foot in the sheer,"
18811,414,"when there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer,"
18812,414,"her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a northern breeze,"
18813,414,"her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the eastern seas,"
18814,414,"light she rode in the rude tide-rip, to left and right she rolled,"
18815,414,"and the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold,"
18816,414,"i ha' paid port dues for your law, quoth he, and where is the law ye boast"
18817,414,if i sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a christian coast?
18818,414,"ye have smoked the hives of the laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk,"
18819,414,we tack not now to a gallang prow or a plunging pei-ho junk;
18820,414,i had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare
18821,414,"till i met with a lime-washed yankee brig that rode off finisterre,"
18822,414,"there were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore,"
18823,414,"and the signals ran for a merchantman from sandy hook to the nore,"
18824,414,"he would not fly the rovers' flag -- the bloody or the black,"
18825,414,"but now he floated the gridiron and now he flaunted the jack,"
18826,414,he spoke of the law as he crimped my crew -- he swore it was only a loan;
18827,414,"but when i would ask for my own again, he swore it was none of my own,"
18828,414,"he has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the line,"
18829,414,he has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine;
18830,414,"he has taken my bale of dammer and spice i won beyond the seas,"
18831,414,he has taken my grinning heathen gods -- and what should he want o' these?
18832,414,"my foremast would not mend his boom, my deckhouse patch his boats;"
18833,414,"he has whittled the two, this yank yahoo, to peddle for shoe-peg oats,"
18834,414,"i could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside,"
18835,414,"but i hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied,"
18836,414,"had i had guns as i had goods to work my christian harm,"
18837,414,i had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm;
18838,414,"i had nailed his ears to my capstan-head, and ripped them off with a saw,"
18839,414,"and soused them in the bilgewater, and served them to him raw;"
18840,414,"i had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark,"
18841,414,"i had towed him aft of his own craft, a bait for his brother shark;"
18842,414,"i had lapped him round with cocoa husk, and drenched him with the oil,"
18843,414,and lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil;
18844,414,"i had stripped his hide for my hammock-side,"
18845,414," and tasselled his beard i' the mesh,"
18846,414,and spitted his crew on the live bamboo
18847,414, that grows through the gangrened flesh;
18848,414,"i had hove him down by the mangroves brown,"
18849,414," where the mud-reef sucks and draws,"
18850,414,moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land-crab's claws!
18851,414,"he is lazar within and lime without, ye can nose him far enow,"
18852,414,for he carries the taint of a musky ship -- the reek of the slaver's dhow!
18853,414,"the skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold,"
18854,414,"and the captains three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold,"
18855,414,"and the captains three called courteously from deck to scuttle-butt, --"
18856,414,"good sir, we ha' dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut,"
18857,414,"your words be words of a lawless race, and the law it standeth thus,"
18858,414,"he comes of a race that have never a law, and he never has boarded us,"
18859,414,"we ha' sold him canvas and rope and spar -- we know that his price is fair,"
18860,414,"and we know that he weeps for the lack of a law as he rides off finisterre,"
18861,414,"and since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you,"
18862,414,"we hold it meet that the english fleet should know that we hold him true,"
18863,414,"the skipper called to the tall taffrail, -- and what is that to me?"
18864,414,did ever you hear of a yankee brig that rifled a seventy-three?
18865,414,do i loom so large from your quarter-deck that i lift like a ship o' the line?
18866,414,"he has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine,"
18867,414,"there is never a law on the cocos keys to hold a white man in,"
18868,414,"but we do not steal the niggers' meal, for that is a nigger's sin,"
18869,414,"must he have his law as a quid to chaw, or laid in brass on his wheel?"
18870,414,does he steal with tears when he buccaneers?
18871,414," 'fore gad, then, why does he steal?"
18872,414,"the skipper bit on a deep-sea word, and the word it was not sweet,"
18873,414,"for he could see the captains three had signalled to the fleet,"
18874,414,"but three and two, in white and blue, the whimpering flags began, --"
18875,414,"we have heard a tale of a -- foreign sail, but he is a merchantman,"
18876,414,"the skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the great horn spoon, --"
18877,414,"'fore gad, the chaplain of the fleet would bless my picaroon!"
18878,414,"by two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air, --"
18879,414,"we have sold our spars to the merchantman -- we know that his price is fair,"
18880,414,"the skipper winked his western eye, and swore by a china storm, --"
18881,414,"they ha' rigged him a joseph's jury-coat to keep his honour warm,"
18882,414,"the halliards twanged against the tops, the bunting bellied broad,"
18883,414,"the skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord,"
18884,414,"masthead -- masthead, the signal sped by the line o' the british craft;"
18885,414,"the skipper called to his lascar crew, and put her about and laughed, --"
18886,414,"it's mainsail haul, my bully boys all -- we'll out to the seas again --"
18887,414,"ere they set us to paint their pirate saint, or scrub at his grapnel-chain,"
18888,414,"it's fore-sheet free, with her head to the sea,"
18889,414, and the swing of the unbought brine --
18890,414,"we'll make no sport in an english court till we come as a ship o' the line,"
18891,414,"till we come as a ship o' the line, my lads, of thirty foot in the sheer,"
18892,414,lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer;
18893,414,"flying his pluck at our mizzen-truck for weft of admiralty,"
18894,414,"heaving his head for our dipsey-lead in sign that we keep the sea,"
18895,414,"then fore-sheet home as she lifts to the foam -- we stand on the outward tack,"
18896,414,we are paid in the coin of the white man's trade --
18897,414," the bezant is hard, ay, and black,"
18898,414,the frigate-bird shall carry my word to the kling and the orang-laut
18899,414,how a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a christian port;
18900,414,how a man may be robbed in christian port while three great captains there
18901,414,shall dip their flag to a slaver's rag -- to show that his trade is fair!
18902,415,away by the lands of the japanee
18903,415,     where the paper lanterns glow
18904,415,    and the crews of all the shipping drink
18905,415,"     in the house of blood street joe,"
18906,415,"    at twilight, when the landward breeze"
18907,415,"     brings up the harbour noise,"
18908,415,    and ebb of yokohama bay
18909,415,"     swigs chattering through the buoys,"
18910,415,    in cisco's dewdrop dining-rooms
18911,415,     they tell the tale anew
18912,415,"    of a hidden sea and a hidden fight,"
18913,415,    when the ~baltic~ ran from the ~northern light~
18914,415,"     and the ~stralsund~ fought the two,"
18915,415,
18916,415,"now this is the law of the muscovite, that he proves with shot and steel,"
18917,415,"when ye come by his isles in the smoky sea ye must not take the seal,"
18918,415,"where the gray sea goes nakedly between the weed-hung shelves,"
18919,415,and the little blue fox he is bred for his skin
18920,415, and the seal they breed for themselves;
18921,415,"for when the ~matkas~ seek the shore to drop their pups aland,"
18922,415,"the great man-seal haul out of the sea, a-roaring, band by band;"
18923,415,"and when the first september gales have slaked their rutting-wrath,"
18924,415,"the great man-seal haul back to the sea and no man knows their path,"
18925,415,"then dark they lie and stark they lie -- rookery, dune, and floe,"
18926,415,and the northern lights come down o' nights to dance with the houseless snow;
18927,415,"and god who clears the grounding berg and steers the grinding floe,"
18928,415,"he hears the cry of the little kit-fox and the wind along the snow,"
18929,415,"but since our women must walk gay and money buys their gear,"
18930,415,"the sealing-boats they filch that way at hazard year by year,"
18931,415,"english they be and japanee that hang on the brown bear's flank,"
18932,415,"and some be scot, but the worst of the lot, and the boldest thieves, be yank!"
18933,415,
18934,415,"it was the sealer ~northern light~, to the smoky seas she bore,"
18935,415,"with a stovepipe stuck from a starboard port and the russian flag at her fore,"
18936,415,"~baltic~, ~stralsund~, and ~northern light~ --"
18937,415, oh! they were birds of a feather --
18938,415,"slipping away to the smoky seas, three seal-thieves together!"
18939,415,"and at last she came to a sandy cove and the baltic lay therein,"
18940,415,"but her men were up with the herding seal to drive and club and skin,"
18941,415,"there were fifteen hundred skins abeach, cool pelt and proper fur,"
18942,415,when the ~northern light~ drove into the bight
18943,415," and the sea-mist drove with her,"
18944,415,the ~baltic~ called her men and weighed -- she could not choose but run --
18945,415,"for a stovepipe seen through the closing mist, it shows like a four-inch gun,"
18946,415,and loss it is that is sad as death to lose both trip and ship
18947,415,"and lie for a rotting contraband on vladivostock slip,"
18948,415,"she turned and dived in the sea-smother as a rabbit dives in the whins,"
18949,415,"and the ~northern light~ sent up her boats to steal the stolen skins,"
18950,415,"they had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clear,"
18951,415,"when they were aware of a sloop-of-war, ghost-white and very near,"
18952,415,"her flag she showed, and her guns she showed -- three of them, black, abeam,"
18953,415,"and a funnel white with the crusted salt, but never a show of steam,"
18954,415,
18955,415,"there was no time to man the brakes, they knocked the shackle free,"
18956,415,"and the ~northern light~ stood out again, goose-winged to open sea,"
18957,415,"for life it is that is worse than death, by force of russian law"
18958,415,"to work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw,"
18959,415,they had not run a mile from shore -- they heard no shots behind --
18960,415,"when the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the wind,"
18961,415,"bluffed -- raised out on a bluff, said he, for if my name's tom hall,"
18962,415,you must set a thief to catch a thief -- and a thief has caught us all!
18963,415,"by every butt in oregon and every spar in maine,"
18964,415,the hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of reuben paine!
18965,415,"he has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar,"
18966,415," and, faith, he has faked her well --"
18967,415,"but i'd know the ~stralsund~'s deckhouse yet from here to the booms o' hell,"
18968,415,"oh, once we ha' met at baltimore, and twice on boston pier,"
18969,415,"but the sickest day for you, reuben paine, was the day that you came here --"
18970,415,"the day that you came here, my lad, to scare us from our seal"
18971,415,"with your funnel made o' your painted cloth, and your guns o' rotten deal!"
18972,415,"ring and blow for the ~baltic~ now, and head her back to the bay,"
18973,415,and we'll come into the game again -- with a double deck to play!
18974,415,
18975,415,they rang and blew the sealers' call -- the poaching cry of the sea --
18976,415,"and they raised the ~baltic~ out of the mist, and an angry ship was she,"
18977,415,"and blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay again,"
18978,415,till they heard the creak of the ~stralsund~'s boom
18979,415," and the clank of her mooring chain,"
18980,415,"they laid them down by bitt and boat, their pistols in their belts,"
18981,415,"and,  will you fight for it, reuben paine, or will you share the pelts?"
18982,415,
18983,415,"a dog-toothed laugh laughed reuben paine, and bared his flenching-knife,"
18984,415,"yea, skin for skin, and all that he hath a man will give for his life;"
18985,415,"but i've six thousand skins below, and yeddo port to see,"
18986,415,"and there's never a law of god or man runs north of fifty-three,"
18987,415,"so go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill,"
18988,415,"and i'll be good to your seal this catch, as many as i shall kill!"
18989,415,
18990,415,"answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gun-butt slid,"
18991,415,"but the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did,"
18992,415,"the weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak,"
18993,415,"and the flame-spurts pale ran down the rail as the sealing-rifles spoke,"
18994,415,"the bullets bit on bend and butt, the splinter slivered free"
18995,415,"little they trust to sparrow-dust that stop the seal in his sea!,"
18996,415,"the thick smoke hung and would not shift, leaden it lay and blue,"
18997,415,"but three were down on the ~baltic~'s deck and two of the ~stralsund~'s crew,"
18998,415,"an arm's-length out and overside the banked fog held them bound,"
18999,415,"but, as they heard or groan or word, they fired at the sound,"
19000,415,"for one cried out on the name of god, and one to have him cease,"
19001,415,and the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace;
19002,415,"and one called out on a heathen joss and one on the virgin's name,"
19003,415,"and the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they came,"
19004,415,"and in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath,"
19005,415,and each man drew his watchful breath slow taken 'tween the teeth --
19006,415,"trigger and ear and eye acock, knit brow and hard-drawn lips --"
19007,415,"bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships,"
19008,415,"till they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breath,"
19009,415,"till they heard the torment of reuben paine that wailed upon his death,"
19010,415,
19011,415,the tides they'll go through fundy race but i'll go nevermore
19012,415,"and see the hogs from ebb-tide mark turn scampering back to shore,"
19013,415,"no more i'll see the trawlers drift below the bass rock ground,"
19014,415,"or watch the tall fall steamer lights tear blazing up the sound,"
19015,415,"sorrow is me, in a lonely sea and a sinful fight i fall,"
19016,415,"but if there's law o' god or man you'll swing for it yet, tom hall!"
19017,415,"tom hall stood up by the quarter-rail,  your words in your teeth, said he,"
19018,415,"there's never a law of god or man runs north of fifty-three,"
19019,415,"so go in grace with him to face, and an ill-spent life behind,"
19020,415,"and i'll be good to your widows, rube, as many as i shall find,"
19021,415,
19022,415,"a ~stralsund~ man shot blind and large, and a war-lock finn was he,"
19023,415,"and he hit tom hall with a bursting ball a hand's-breadth over the knee,"
19024,415,"tom hall caught hold by the topping-lift, and sat him down with an oath,"
19025,415,"you'll wait a little, rube, he said, the devil has called for both,"
19026,415,"the devil is driving both this tide, and the killing-grounds are close,"
19027,415,"and we'll go up to the wrath of god as the holluschickie goes,"
19028,415,"o men, put back your guns again and lay your rifles by,"
19029,415,"we've fought our fight, and the best are down,  let up and let us die!"
19030,415,"quit firing, by the bow there -- quit!  call off the ~baltic~'s crew!"
19031,415,"you're sure of hell as me or rube -- but wait till we get through,"
19032,415,"there went no word between the ships, but thick and quick and loud"
19033,415,"the life-blood drummed on the dripping decks,"
19034,415," with the fog-dew from the shroud,"
19035,415,"the sea-pull drew them side by side, gunnel to gunnel laid,"
19036,415,"and they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear, but never a word was said,"
19037,415,
19038,415,"then reuben paine cried out again before his spirit passed,"
19039,415,have i followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last?
19040,415,curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind --
19041,415,"i have gotten my death where i got my bread, but i dare not face it blind,"
19042,415,curse on the fog!  is there never a wind of all the winds i knew
19043,415,"to clear the smother from off my chest, and let me look at the blue?"
19044,415,"the good fog heard -- like a splitten sail, to left and right she tore,"
19045,415,"and they saw the sun-dogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore,"
19046,415,"silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steel-backed tide,"
19047,415,"and pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside,"

19402,423,"and the red horse went hillward with the dawn,"
19403,423,"but near the cattle-troughs his hoof-prints lay,"
19404,423,
19405,423,"that night, the slow mists of the evening dropped,"
19406,423,"dropped as a cloth upon the dead, but rose"
19407,423,"a little higher, to a young girl's height;"
19408,423,"till all the valley glittered like a lake,"
19409,423,"beneath the moonlight, filled with sluggish mist,"
19410,423,
19411,423,"that night, the red horse grazed beyond the dam,"
19412,423,"a stone's-throw from the troughs,  men heard him feed,"
19413,423,"and those that heard him sickened where they lay,"
19414,423,"thus came the sickness to er-heb, and slew"
19415,423,"of men a score, and of the women eight,"
19416,423,"and of the children two,"
19417,423,
19418,423,                         because the road
19419,423,"to gorukh was a road of enemies,"
19420,423,"and ao-safai was blocked with early snow,"
19421,423,"we could not flee from out the valley,  death"
19422,423,"smote at us in a slaughter-pen, and kysh"
19423,423,"was mute as yabosh, though the goats were slain;"
19424,423,"and the red horse grazed nightly by the stream,"
19425,423,"and later, outward, towards the unlighted shrine,"
19426,423,"and those that heard him sickened where they lay,"
19427,423,
19428,423,"then said bisesa to the priests at dusk,"
19429,423,"when the white mist rose up breast-high, and choked"
19430,423,"the voices in the houses of the dead, --"
19431,423,"yabosh and kysh avail not,  if the horse"
19432,423,"reach the unlighted shrine we surely die,"
19433,423,"ye have forgotten of all gods the chief,"
19434,423,taman!  here rolled the thunder through the hills
19435,423,"and yabosh shook upon his pedestal,"
19436,423,ye have forgotten of all gods the chief
19437,423,"too long,  and all were dumb save one, who cried"
19438,423,"on yabosh with the sapphire 'twixt his knees,"
19439,423,"but found no answer in the smoky roof,"
19440,423,"and, being smitten of the sickness, died"
19441,423,"before the altar of the sapphire shrine,"
19442,423,
19443,423,"then said bisesa, -- i am near to death,"
19444,423,and have the wisdom of the grave for gift
19445,423,"to bear me on the path my feet must tread,"
19446,423,"if there be wealth on earth, then i am rich,"
19447,423,for armod is the first of all er-heb;
19448,423,"if there be beauty on the earth, -- her eyes"
19449,423,"dropped for a moment to the temple floor, --"
19450,423,"ye know that i am fair,  if there be love,"
19451,423,"ye know that love is mine,  the chief in war,"
19452,423,"the man of sixty spears, broke from the press,"
19453,423,"and would have clasped her, but the priests withstood,"
19454,423,"saying, -- she has a message from taman,"
19455,423,"then said bisesa, -- by my wealth and love"
19456,423,"and beauty, i am chosen of the god"
19457,423,"taman,  here rolled the thunder through the hills"
19458,423,"and kysh fell forward on the mound of skulls,"
19459,423,
19460,423,"in darkness, and before our priests, the maid"
19461,423,"between the altars cast her bracelets down,"
19462,423,"therewith the heavy earrings armod made,"
19463,423,"when he was young, out of the water-gold"
19464,423,of gorukh -- threw the breast-plate thick with jade
19465,423,upon the turquoise anklets -- put aside
19466,423,the bands of silver on her brow and neck;
19467,423,"and as the trinkets tinkled on the stones,"
19468,423,"the thunder of taman lowed like a bull,"
19469,423,
19470,423,"then said bisesa, stretching out her hands,"
19471,423,"as one in darkness fearing devils, -- help!"
19472,423,"o priests, i am a woman very weak,"
19473,423,and who am i to know the will of gods?
19474,423,taman hath called me -- whither shall i go?
19475,423,"the chief in war, the man of sixty spears,"
19476,423,"howled in his torment, fettered by the priests,"
19477,423,"but dared not come to her to drag her forth,"
19478,423,"and dared not lift his spear against the priests,"
19479,423,"then all men wept,"
19480,423,
19481,423,                   there was a priest of kysh
19482,423,"bent with a hundred winters, hairless, blind,"
19483,423,"and taloned as the great snow-eagle is,"
19484,423,"his seat was nearest to the altar-fires,"
19485,423,"and he was counted dumb among the priests,"
19486,423,"but, whether kysh decreed, or from taman"
19487,423,the impotent tongue found utterance we know
19488,423,"as little as the bats beneath the eaves,"
19489,423,"he cried so that they heard who stood without, --"
19490,423,to the unlighted shrine! and crept aside
19491,423,into the shadow of his fallen god
19492,423,"and whimpered, and bisesa went her way,"
19493,423,
19494,423,"that night, the slow mists of the evening dropped,"
19495,423,"dropped as a cloth upon the dead, and rose"
19496,423,"above the roofs, and by the unlighted shrine"
19497,423,lay as the slimy water of the troughs
19498,423,"when murrain thins the cattle of er-heb,"
19499,423,"and through the mist men heard the red horse feed,"
19500,423,
19501,423,"in armod's house they burned bisesa's dower,"
19502,423,"and killed her black bull tor, and broke her wheel,"
19503,423,"and loosed her hair, as for the marriage-feast,"
19504,423,"with cries more loud than mourning for the dead,"
19505,423,
19506,423,"across the fields, from armod's dwelling-place,"
19507,423,we heard bisesa weeping where she passed
19508,423,to seek the unlighted shrine; the red horse neighed
19509,423,"and followed her, and on the river-mint"
19510,423,"his hooves struck dead and heavy in our ears,"
19511,423,
19512,423,"out of the mists of evening, as the star"
19513,423,of ao-safai climbs through the black snow-blur
19514,423,"to show the pass is clear, bisesa stepped"
19515,423,"upon the great gray slope of mortised stone,"
19516,423,"the causeway of taman,  the red horse neighed"
19517,423,behind her to the unlighted shrine -- then fled
19518,423,"north to the mountain where his stable lies,"
19519,423,
19520,423,"they know who dared the anger of taman,"
19521,423,"and watched that night above the clinging mists,"
19522,423,"far up the hill, bisesa's passing in,"
19523,423,
19524,423,"she set her hand upon the carven door,"
19525,423,"fouled by a myriad bats, and black with time,"
19526,423,whereon is graved the glory of taman
19527,423,in letters older than the ao-safai;
19528,423,"and twice she turned aside and twice she wept,"
19529,423,"cast down upon the threshold, clamouring"
19530,423,"for him she loved -- the man of sixty spears,"
19531,423,"and for her father, -- and the black bull tor,"
19532,423,"hers and her pride,  yea, twice she turned away"
19533,423,"before the awful darkness of the door,"
19534,423,and the great horror of the wall of man
19535,423,"where man is made the plaything of taman,"
19536,423,"an eyeless face that waits above and laughs,"
19537,423,
19538,423,but the third time she cried and put her palms
19539,423,"against the hewn stone leaves, and prayed taman"
19540,423,"to spare er-heb and take her life for price,"
19541,423,
19542,423,"they know who watched, the doors were rent apart"
19543,423,"and closed upon bisesa, and the rain"
19544,423,"broke like a flood across the valley, washed"
19545,423,the mist away; but louder than the rain
19546,423,"the thunder of taman filled men with fear,"
19547,423,
19548,423,some say that from the unlighted shrine she cried
19549,423,"for succour, very pitifully, thrice,"
19550,423,"and others that she sang and had no fear,"
19551,423,"and some that there was neither song nor cry,"
19552,423,"but only thunder and the lashing rain,"
19553,423,
19554,423,"howbeit, in the morning men rose up,"
19555,423,"perplexed with horror, crowding to the shrine,"
19556,423,and when er-heb was gathered at the doors
19557,423,the priests made lamentation and passed in
19558,423,to a strange temple and a god they feared
19559,423,"but knew not,"
19560,423,
19561,423,              from the crevices the grass
19562,423,"had thrust the altar-slabs apart, the walls"
19563,423,"were gray with stains unclean, the roof-beams swelled"
19564,423,"with many-coloured growth of rottenness,"
19565,423,and lichen veiled the image of taman
19566,423,"in leprosy,  the basin of the blood"
19567,423,"above the altar held the morning sun,"
19568,423,"a winking ruby on its heart,  below,"
19569,423,"face hid in hands, the maid bisesa lay,"
19570,423,
19571,423,    er-heb beyond the hills of ao-safai
19572,423,"    bears witness to the truth, and ao-safai"
19573,423,"    hath told the men of gorukh,  thence the tale"
19574,423,"    comes westward o'er the peaks to india,"
19575,424,who hath desired the sea? -- the sight of salt water unbounded --
19576,424,the heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded?
19577,424,"the sleek-barrelled swell before storm, grey, foamless, enormous, and growing --"
19578,424,stark calm on the lap of the line or the crazy-eyed hurricane blowing --
19579,424,"his sea in no showing the same  his sea and the same 'neath each showing,"
19580,424,          his sea as she slackens or thrills?
19581,424,so and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their hills!
19582,424,
19583,424,who hath desired the sea? -- the immense and contemptuous surges?
19584,424,"the shudder, the stumble, the swerve, as the star-stabbing bow-sprit emerges?"
19585,424,"the orderly clouds of the trades, the ridged, roaring sapphire thereunder --"
19586,424,unheralded cliff-haunting flaws and the headsail's low-volleying thunder --
19587,424,"his sea in no wonder the same  his sea and the same through each wonder,"
19588,424,         his sea as she rages or stills?
19589,424,"so and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their hills,"
19590,424,
19591,424,who hath desired the sea? her menaces swift as her mercies?
19592,424,the in-rolling walls of the fog and the silver-winged breeze that disperses?
19593,424,the unstable mined berg going south and the calvings and groans that declare it --
19594,424,white water half-guessed overside and the moon breaking timely to bare it --
19595,424,"his sea as his fathers have dared -- his sea as his children shall dare it,"
19596,424,         his sea as she serves him or kills?
19597,424,"so and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their hills,"
19598,424,
19599,424,who hath desired the sea? her excellent loneliness rather
19600,424,"than forecourts of kings, and her outermost pits than the streets where men gather"
19601,424,"inland, among dust, under trees -- inland where the slayer may slay him --"
19602,424,"inland, out of reach of her arms, and the bosom whereon he must lay him"
19603,424,"his sea from the first that betrayed -- at the last that shall never betray him,"
19604,424,         his sea that his being fulfils?
19605,424,"so and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their hills,"
19606,425,"there dwells a wife by the northern gate,"
19607,425,and a wealthy wife is she;
19608,425,she breeds a breed o' rovin' men
19609,425,"and casts them over sea,"
19610,425,
19611,425,"and some are drowned in deep water,"
19612,425,"and some in sight o' shore,"
19613,425,and word goes back to the weary wife
19614,425,"and ever she sends more,"
19615,425,
19616,425,"for since that wife had gate or gear,"
19617,425,"or hearth or garth or bield,"
19618,425,"she willed her sons to the white harvest,"
19619,425,"and that is a bitter yield,"
19620,425,
19621,425,"she wills her sons to the wet ploughing,"
19622,425,"to ride the horse of tree,"
19623,425,and syne her sons come back again
19624,425,"far-spent from out the sea,"
19625,425,
19626,425,the good wife's sons come home again
19627,425,"with little into their hands,"
19628,425,but the lore of men that ha' dealt with men
19629,425,in the new and naked lands;
19630,425,
19631,425,but the faith of men that ha' brothered men
19632,425,"by more than easy breath,"
19633,425,and the eyes o' men that ha' read wi' men
19634,425,"in the open books of death,"
19635,425,
19636,425,"rich are they, rich in wonders seen,"
19637,425,but poor in the goods o' men;
19638,425,so what they ha' got by the skin o' their teeth
19639,425,"they sell for their teeth again,"
19640,425,
19641,425,for whether they lose to the naked life
19642,425,"or win to their hearts' desire,"
19643,425,they tell it all to the weary wife
19644,425,"that nods beside the fire,"
19645,425,
19646,425,her hearth is wide to every wind
19647,425,that makes the white ash spin;
19648,425,and tide and tide and 'tween the tides
19649,425,her sons go out and in;
19650,425,
19651,425,out with great mirth that do desire
19652,425,"hazard of trackless ways,"
19653,425,in with content to wait their watch
19654,425,and warm before the blaze;
19655,425,
19656,425,"and some return by failing light,"
19657,425,"and some in waking dream,"
19658,425,for she hears the heels of the dripping ghosts
19659,425,"that ride the rough roof-beam,"
19660,425,
19661,425,"home, they come home from all the ports,"
19662,425,the living and the dead;
19663,425,the good wife's sons come home again
19664,425,for her blessing on their head!
19665,426,we've sent our little cupids all ashore --
19666,426," they were frightened, they were tired, they were cold,"
19667,426,"our sails of silk and purple go to store,"
19668,426, and we've cut away our mast of beaten gold
19669,426,foul weather!

19673,426,"the sea has shorn our galleries away,"

19714,427,"we were taken from the ore-bed and the mine,"
19715,427, we were melted in the furnace and the pit--

20557,442,
20558,442,pleased was his tribe with that image -- came in their hundreds to scan --
20559,442,"handled it, smelt it, and grunted,  verily, this is a man!"
20560,442,"thus do we carry our lances -- thus is a war-belt slung,"
20561,442,"lo! it is even as we are,  glory and honour to ung!"
20562,442,
20563,442,later he pictured an aurochs -- later he pictured a bear --
20564,442,pictured the sabre-tooth tiger dragging a man to his lair --

20566,442,"out of the love that he bore them, scribing them clearly on bone,"

20572,442,
20573,442,ung -- hath he slept with the aurochs -- watched where the mastodon roam?
20574,442,spoke on the ice with the bow-head -- followed the sabre-tooth home?
20575,442,"nay!  these are toys of his fancy!  if he have cheated us so,"
20576,442,how is there truth in his image -- the man that he fashioned of snow?
20577,442,
20578,442,"wroth was that maker of pictures -- hotly he answered the call,"
20579,442,"hunters and fishers and trappers, children and fools are ye all!"
20580,442,"look at the beasts when ye hunt them!  swift from the tumult he broke,"
20581,442,"ran to the cave of his father and told him the shame that they spoke,"
20582,442,
20583,442,"and the father of ung gave answer, that was old and wise in the craft,"
20584,442,"maker of pictures aforetime, he leaned on his lance and laughed,"
20585,442,"if they could see as thou seest they would do what thou hast done,"
20586,442,"and each man would make him a picture, and -- what would become of my son?"
20587,442,
20588,442,"there would be no pelts of the reindeer, flung down at thy cave for a gift,"

20606,442,"son that can see so clearly, return them their gifts again!"
20607,442,
20608,442,and ung looked down at his deerskins -- their broad shell-tasselled bands --
20609,442,and ung drew downward his mitten and looked at his naked hands;
20610,442,"and he gloved himself and departed, and he heard his father, behind,"
20611,442,"son that can see so clearly, rejoice that thy tribe is blind!"
20612,442,
20613,442,"straight on the glittering ice-field, by the caves of the lost dordogne,"

21124,455,"and some are sulky, while some will plunge,"
21125,455,"so ho! steady! stand still, you!"
21126,455,"some you must gentle, and some you must lunge,"
21127,455,there! there! who wants to kill you?
21128,455,some -- there are losses in every trade --
21129,455,"wreck their hearts ere bitted and made,"
21130,455,"will fight like fiends as the rope cuts hard,"
21131,455,"and die dumb-mad in the breaking-yard,"
21132,456,"what of the hunting, hunter bold?"
21133,456,"brother, the watch was long and cold,"
21134,456,what of the quarry ye went to kill?
21135,456,"brother, he crops in the jungle still,"
21136,456,where is the power that made your pride?
21137,456,"brother, it ebbs from my flank and side,"
21138,456,where is the haste that ye hurry by?
21139,456,"brother, i go to my lair to die!"
21140,457,"i have made for you a song,"
21141,457,"        and it may be right or wrong,"
21142,457,    but only you can tell me if it's true;
21143,457,        i have tried for to explain
21144,457,"        both your pleasure and your pain,"
21145,457,"    and, thomas, here's my best respects to you!"
21146,457,
21147,457,        o there'll surely come a day
21148,457,"        when they'll give you all your pay,"
21149,457,    and treat you as a christian ought to do;
21150,457,"        so, until that day comes round,"
21151,457,"        heaven keep you safe and sound,"
21152,457,"    and, thomas, here's my best respects to you!"
21153,458,"the cities are full of pride,"
21154,458,      challenging each to each --
21155,458,"    this from her mountain-side,"
21156,458,"      that from her burthened beach,"
21157,458,
21158,458,    they count their ships full tale --
21159,458,"      their corn and oil and wine,"
21160,458,"    derrick and loom and bale,"
21161,458,      and rampart's gun-flecked line;
21162,458,"    city by city they hail,"
21163,458,      hast aught to match with mine?
21164,458,
21165,458,    and the men that breed from them
21166,458,"      they traffic up and down,"
21167,458,    but cling to their cities' hem
21168,458,"      as a child to their mother's gown,"
21169,458,
21170,458,"    when they talk with the stranger bands,"
21171,458,      dazed and newly alone;
21172,458,"    when they walk in the stranger lands,"
21173,458,      by roaring streets unknown;
21174,458,    blessing her where she stands
21175,458,"      for strength above their own,"
21176,458,
21177,458,    on high to hold her fame
21178,458,"      that stands all fame beyond,"
21179,458,"    by oath to back the same,"
21180,458,      most faithful-foolish-fond;
21181,458,    making her mere-breathed name
21182,458,"      their bond upon their bond,"
21183,458,
21184,458,    so thank i god my birth
21185,458,      fell not in isles aside --
21186,458,"    waste headlands of the earth,"
21187,458,      or warring tribes untried --
21188,458,    but that she lent me worth
21189,458,"      and gave me right to pride,"
21190,458,
21191,458,    surely in toil or fray
21192,458,"      under an alien sky,"
21193,458,"    comfort it is to say,"
21194,458,      of no mean city am i!
21195,458,
21196,458,    neither by service nor fee
21197,458,      come i to mine estate --
21198,458,"    mother of cities to me,"
21199,458,"      for i was born in her gate,"
21200,458,"    between the palms and the sea,"
21201,458,"      where the world-end steamers wait,"
21202,458,
21203,458,"    now for this debt i owe,"
21204,458,      and for her far-borne cheer
21205,458,    must i make haste and go
21206,458,"      with tribute to her pier,"
21207,458,
21208,458,    and she shall touch and remit
21209,458,      after the use of kings
21210,458,"    orderly, ancient, fit"
21211,458,"      my deep-sea plunderings,"
21212,458,"    and purchase in all lands,"
21213,458,      and this we do for a sign
21214,458,"    her power is over mine,"
21215,458,      and mine i hold at her hands!
21216,459,"how comes it that, at even-tide,"
21217,459,"when level beams should show most truth,"
21218,459,"man, failing, takes unfailing pride"
21219,459,in memories of his frolic youth?
21220,459,
21221,459,venus and liber fill their hour;
21222,459,"the games engage, the law-courts prove;"
21223,459,till hardened life breeds love of power
21224,459,"or avarice, age's final love,"
21225,459,
21226,459,"yet at the end, these comfort not -"
21227,459,nor any triumph fate decrees -
21228,459,"compared with glorious, unforgot -"
21229,459,ten innocent enormities
21230,459,
21231,459,"of frontless days before the beard,"
21232,459,"when, instant on the casual jest,"
21233,459,the god himself of mirth appeared
21234,459,and snatched us to his heaving breast
21235,459,
21236,459,and we - not caring who he was
21237,459,but certain he would come again -
21238,459,accepted all he brought to pass
21239,459,"as gods accept the lives of men,"
21240,459,
21241,459,"then he withdrew from sight and speech,"
21242,459,"nor left a shrine, how comes it now,"
21243,459,"while charon's keel grates on the beach,"
21244,459,"he calls so clear, rememberest thou?"
21245,460,"thy face is far from this our war,"
21246,460,"      our call and counter-cry,"
21247,460,"    i shall not find thee quick and kind,"
21248,460,"      nor know thee till i die,"
21249,460,    enough for me in dreams to see
21250,460,"      and touch thy garments' hem,"
21251,460,    thy feet have trod so near to god
21252,460,"      i may not follow them,"
21253,460,
21254,460,through wantonness if men profess
21255,460,"they weary of thy parts,"
21256,460,e'en let them die at blasphemy
21257,460,and perish with their arts;
21258,460,"but we that love, but we that prove"
21259,460,"thine excellence august,"
21260,460,while we adore discover more
21261,460,"thee perfect, wise, and just,"
21262,460,
21263,460,since spoken word man's spirit stirred
21264,460,"beyond his belly-need,"
21265,460,what is is thine of fair design
21266,460,in thought and craft and deed;
21267,460,"each stroke aright of toil and fight,"
21268,460,"that was and that shall be,"
21269,460,"and hope too high, wherefore we die,"
21270,460,"has birth and worth in thee,"
21271,460,
21272,460,who holds by thee hath heaven in fee
21273,460,"to gild his dross thereby,"
21274,460,and knowledge sure that he endure
21275,460,a child until he die --
21276,460,for to make plain that man's disdain
21277,460,is but new beauty's birth --
21278,460,for to possess in loneliness
21279,460,"the joy of all the earth,"
21280,460,
21281,460,as thou didst teach all lovers speech
21282,460,"and life all mystery,"
21283,460,so shalt thou rule by every school
21284,460,"till love and longing die,"
21285,460,"who wast or yet the lights were set,"
21286,460,"a whisper in the void,"
21287,460,who shalt be sung through planets young
21288,460,"when this is clean destroyed,"
21289,460,
21290,460,"beyond the bounds our staring rounds,"
21291,460,"across the pressing dark,"
21292,460,the children wise of outer skies
21293,460,look hitherward and mark
21294,460,"a light that shifts, a glare that drifts,"
21295,460,"rekindling thus and thus,"
21296,460,"not all forlorn, for thou hast borne"
21297,460,"strange tales to them of us,"
21298,460,
21299,460,time hath no tide but must abide
21300,460,the servant of thy will;
21301,460,"tide hath no time, for to thy rhyme"
21302,460,the ranging stars stand still --
21303,460,"regent of spheres that lock our fears,"
21304,460,"our hopes invisible,"
21305,460,oh 'twas certes at thy decrees
21306,460,we fashioned heaven and hell!
21307,460,
21308,460,pure wisdom hath no certain path
21309,460,"that lacks thy morning-eyne,"
21310,460,and captains bold by thee controlled
21311,460,most like to gods design;
21312,460,thou art the voice to kingly boys
21313,460,"to lift them through the fight,"
21314,460,"and comfortress of unsuccess,"
21315,460,to give the dead good-night --
21316,460,
21317,460,a veil to draw 'twixt god his law
21318,460,"and man's infirmity,"
21319,460,a shadow kind to dumb and blind
21320,460,the shambles where we die;
21321,460,a rule to trick th' arithmetic
21322,460,too base of leaguing odds --
21323,460,"the spur of trust, the curb of lust,"
21324,460,thou handmaid of the gods!
21325,460,
21326,460,"o charity, all patiently"
21327,460,abiding wrack and scaith!
21328,460,"o faith, that meets ten thousand cheats"
21329,460,yet drops no jot of faith!
21330,460,devil and brute thou dost transmute
21331,460,"to higher, lordlier show,"
21332,460,who art in sooth that lovely truth
21333,460,the careless angels know!
21334,460,
21335,460,"    thy face is far from this our war,"
21336,460,"      our call and counter-cry,"
21337,460,"    i may not find thee quick and kind,"
21338,460,"      nor know thee till i die,"
21339,460,
21340,460,    yet may i look with heart unshook
21341,460,      on blow brought home or missed --
21342,460,    yet may i hear with equal ear
21343,460,      the clarions down the list;
21344,460,    yet set my lance above mischance
21345,460,      and ride the barriere --
21346,460,"    oh, hit or miss, how little 'tis,"
21347,460,      my lady is not there!
21348,461,the world hath set its heavy yoke
21349,461,upon the old white-bearded folk
21350,461,"who strive to please the king,"
21351,461,"god's mercy is upon the young,"
21352,461,god's wisdom in the baby tongue
21353,461,"that fears not anything,"
21354,462,"now tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in berkeley square,"
21355,462,and a spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair --
21356,462,"a spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away,"
21357,462,"till he heard as the roar of a rain-fed ford the roar of the milky way,"
21358,462,"till he heard the roar of the milky way die down and drone and cease,"
21359,462,"and they came to the gate within the wall where peter holds the keys,"
21360,462,"stand up, stand up now, tomlinson, and answer loud and high"
21361,462,the good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die --
21362,462,the good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone!
21363,462,"and the naked soul of tomlinson grew white as a rain-washed bone,"
21364,462,"o i have a friend on earth, he said, that was my priest and guide,"
21365,462,"and well would he answer all for me if he were by my side,"
21366,462,"-- for that ye strove in neighbour-love it shall be written fair,"
21367,462,"but now ye wait at heaven's gate and not in berkeley square,"
21368,462,"though we called your friend from his bed this night,"
21369,462," he could not speak for you,"
21370,462,"for the race is run by one and one and never by two and two,"
21371,462,"then tomlinson looked up and down, and little gain was there,"
21372,462,"for the naked stars grinned overhead, and he saw that his soul was bare,"
21373,462,"the wind that blows between the worlds, it cut him like a knife,"
21374,462,"and tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life,"
21375,462,"this i have read in a book, he said, and that was told to me,"
21376,462,"and this i have thought that another man thought of a prince in muscovy,"
21377,462,"the good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path,"
21378,462,"and peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath,"
21379,462,"ye have read, ye have heard, ye have thought, he said,"
21380,462," and the tale is yet to run,"
21381,462,"by the worth of the body that once ye had, give answer -- what ha' ye done?"
21382,462,"then tomlinson looked back and forth, and little good it bore,"
21383,462,"for the darkness stayed at his shoulder-blade and heaven's gate before, --"
21384,462,"o this i have felt, and this i have guessed, and this i have heard men say,"
21385,462,"and this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in norroway,"
21386,462,"-- ye have read, ye have felt, ye have guessed, good lack!"
21387,462, ye have hampered heaven's gate;
21388,462,there's little room between the stars in idleness to prate!
21389,462,"o none may reach by hired speech of neighbour, priest, and kin"
21390,462,through borrowed deed to god's good meed that lies so fair within;
21391,462,"get hence, get hence to the lord of wrong, for doom has yet to run,"
21392,462,"and, , ,the faith that ye share with berkeley square uphold you, tomlinson!"
21393,462,
21394,462,"    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,"
21395,462,
21396,462,"the spirit gripped him by the hair, and sun by sun they fell"
21397,462,"till they came to the belt of naughty stars that rim the mouth of hell,"
21398,462,"the first are red with pride and wrath, the next are white with pain,"
21399,462,"but the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again,"
21400,462,"they may hold their path, they may leave their path,"
21401,462," with never a soul to mark,"
21402,462,"they may burn or freeze, but they must not cease"
21403,462," in the scorn of the outer dark,"
21404,462,"the wind that blows between the worlds, it nipped him to the bone,"
21405,462,and he yearned to the flare of hell-gate
21406,462," there as the light of his own hearth-stone,"
21407,462,"the devil he sat behind the bars, where the desperate legions drew,"
21408,462,"but he caught the hasting tomlinson and would not let him through,"
21409,462,"wot ye the price of good pit-coal that i must pay? said he,"
21410,462,that ye rank yoursel' so fit for hell and ask no leave of me?
21411,462,"i am all o'er-sib to adam's breed that ye should give me scorn,"
21412,462,"for i strove with god for your first father the day that he was born,"
21413,462,"sit down, sit down upon the slag, and answer loud and high"
21414,462,"the harm that ye did to the sons of men or ever you came to die,"
21415,462,"and tomlinson looked up and up, and saw against the night"
21416,462,the belly of a tortured star blood-red in hell-mouth light;
21417,462,"and tomlinson looked down and down, and saw beneath his feet"
21418,462,"the frontlet of a tortured star milk-white in hell-mouth heat,"
21419,462,"o i had a love on earth, said he, that kissed me to my fall,"
21420,462,"and if ye would call my love to me i know she would answer all,"
21421,462,"-- all that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair,"
21422,462,"but now ye wait at hell-mouth gate and not in berkeley square,"
21423,462,"though we whistled your love from her bed to-night, i trow she would not run,"
21424,462,for the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one!
21425,462,"the wind that blows between the worlds, it cut him like a knife,"
21426,462,"and tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life, --"
21427,462,"once i ha' laughed at the power of love and twice at the grip of the grave,"
21428,462,"and thrice i ha' patted my god on the head that men might call me brave,"
21429,462,"the devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool, --"
21430,462,do ye think i would waste my good pit-coal on the hide of a brain-sick fool?
21431,462,i see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did
21432,462,"that i should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid,"
21433,462,"then tomlinson looked back and forth, and there was little grace,"
21434,462,"for hell-gate filled the houseless soul with the fear of naked space,"
21435,462,"nay, this i ha' heard, quo'  tomlinson, and this was noised abroad,"
21436,462,"and this i ha' got from a belgian book on the word of a dead french lord,"
21437,462,"-- ye ha' heard, ye ha' read, ye ha' got, good lack!"
21438,462, and the tale begins afresh --
21439,462,have ye sinned one sin for the pride o' the eye
21440,462, or the sinful lust of the flesh?
21441,462,"then tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered, let me in --"
21442,462,"for i mind that i borrowed my neighbour's wife to sin the deadly sin,"
21443,462,"the devil he grinned behind the bars, and banked the fires high,"
21444,462,"did ye read of that sin in a book? said he; and tomlinson said, ay!"
21445,462,"the devil he blew upon his nails, and the little devils ran,"
21446,462,"and he said,  go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man,"
21447,462,"winnow him out 'twixt star and star, and sieve his proper worth,"
21448,462,"there's sore decline in adam's line if this be spawn of earth,"
21449,462,"empusa's crew, so naked-new they may not face the fire,"
21450,462,"but weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire,"
21451,462,"over the coal they chased the soul, and racked it all abroad,"
21452,462,"as children rifle a caddis-case or the raven's foolish hoard,"
21453,462,"and back they came with the tattered thing, as children after play,"
21454,462,"and they said,  the soul that he got from god he has bartered clean away,"
21455,462,"we have threshed a stook of print and book, and winnowed a chattering wind"
21456,462,"and many a soul wherefrom he stole, but his we cannot find,"
21457,462,"we have handled him, we have dandled him, we have seared him to the bone,"
21458,462,"and sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own,"

21786,469,to seek her love between the spears and find her crown therein!
21787,469,"one shame is mine to-day, what need the weight of double shame?"
21788,469,"if once we reach the delhi gate, though all be lost, i win!"
21789,469,
21790,469,"we rode -- the white mare failed -- her trot a staggering stumble grew, --"
21791,469,the cooking-smoke of even rose and weltered and hung low;
21792,469,"and still we heard the populzai and still we strained anew,"
21793,469,"and delhi town was very near, but nearer was the foe,"
21794,469,
21795,469,"yea, delhi town was very near when lalun whispered, -- slay!"
21796,469,"lord of my life, the mare sinks fast -- stab deep and let me die!"
21797,469,"but scindia would not, and the maid tore free and flung away,"
21798,469,"and turning as she fell we heard the clattering populzai,"
21799,469,
21800,469,"then scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breath,"
21801,469,and wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a hand's-breadth in her side --
21802,469,the hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death --
21803,469,"the blood had chilled about her heart, she reared and fell and died,"
21804,469,
21805,469,"our gods were kind,  before he heard the maiden's piteous scream"
21806,469,"a log upon the delhi road, beneath the mare he lay --"
21807,469,lost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dream;
21808,469,"the darkness closed about his eyes -- i bore my king away,"
21809,470,"yet at the last, ere our spearmen had found him,"
21810,470,"yet at the last, ere a sword-thrust could save,"
21811,470,"yet at the last, with his masters around him,"
21812,470,"he spoke of the faith as a master to slave,"
21813,470,"yet at the last, though the kafirs had maimed him,"
21814,470,"broken by bondage and wrecked by the reiver,"
21815,470,"yet at the last, tho' the darkness had claimed him,"
21816,470,"he called upon allah, and died a believer!"
21817,471,"the doorkeepers of zion,"
21818,471, they do not always stand
21819,471,"in helmet and whole armour,"
21820,471, with halberds in their hand;
21821,471,"but, being sure of zion,"
21822,471," and all her mysteries,"
21823,471,"they rest awhile in zion,"
21824,471,sit down and smile in zion;
21825,471,"ay, even jest in zion;"
21826,471," in zion, at their ease,"
21827,471,
21828,471,"the gatekeepers of baal,"
21829,471," they dare not sit or lean,"
21830,471,but fume and fret and posture
21831,471, and foam and curse between;
21832,471,"for being bound to baal,"
21833,471," whose sacrifice is vain,"
21834,471,"their rest is scant with baal,"
21835,471,"they glare and pant for baal,"
21836,471,"they mouth and rant for baal,"
21837,471, for baal in their pain!
21838,471,
21839,471,"but we will go to zion,"
21840,471," by choice and not through dread,"
21841,471,with these our present comrades
21842,471, and those our present dead;
21843,471,"and, being free of zion"
21844,471," in both her fellowships,"
21845,471,sit down and sup in zion --
21846,471,stand up and drink in zion
21847,471,whatever cup in zion
21848,471, is offered to our lips!
