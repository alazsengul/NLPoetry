397,10,she catches him--then roger ties
398,10,his own head up--but not his eyes;
399,10,"for thro' the slender cloth he sees,"
400,10,"and runs at sam, who slips with ease"
401,10,"his clumsy hold; and, dodging round,"

403,10,`see what it is to play unfair!

406,10,"`he sees! he sees!' cries, softly, grace;"
407,10,"`o roger, thou, unskill'd in art,"
408,10,"must, surer bound, go thro' thy part!'"

661,17,"come, kings, and listen to my song,"
662,17,"when gwin, the son of nore,"
663,17,over the nations of the north
664,17,his cruel sceptre bore;

832,19,
833,19,now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song

838,20,and tasted all the summer's pride
839,20,'til the prince of love beheld
840,20,who in the sunny beams did glide!
841,20,
842,20,he shew'd me lilies for my hair
843,20,and blushing roses for my brow;
844,20,"he led me through his garden fair,"
845,20,"where all his golden pleasures grow,"
846,20,
847,20,"with sweet may dews my wings were wet,"
848,20,and phoebus fir'd my vocal rage

858,21,"    mercy, pity, peace"
859,21,"    is the world's release,"
860,21,    thus he sung all day

916,23,"    and he forc'd and forc'd and forc'd,"
917,23,"    down the golden hinges tore,"
918,23,"    and along the pavement sweet,"
919,23,"   set with pearls and rubies bright,"
920,23,   all his slimy length he drew

922,23,   vomiting his poison out

924,23,   so i turn'd into a sty

927,24,"   and its fallen emanation, the spectre and its cruel shadow,"
928,24,"   i see the past, present and future existing all at once"
929,24,"   before me, o divine spirit, sustain me on thy wings,"
930,24,   that i may awake albion from his long and cold repose;
931,24,"   for bacon and newton, sheath'd in dismal steel, their terrors hang"

933,24,"   infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations,"
934,24,
935,24,   i turn my eyes to the schools and universities of europe
936,24,"  and there behold the loom of locke, whose woof rages dire,"
937,24,"  wash'd by the water-wheels of newton, black the cloth"
938,24,"  in heavy wreaths folds over every nation, cruel works"
939,24,"  of many wheels i view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic"
940,24,"  moving by compulsion each other, not as those in eden, which,"
941,24,"  wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace,"
942,25,"if it is true, what the prophets write,"
943,25,"that the heathen gods are all stocks and stones,"
944,25,"shall we, for the sake of being polite,"
945,25,feed them with the juice of our marrow-bones?

983,28,and was the holy lamb of god
984,28,on england's pleasant pastures seen?
985,28,
986,28,and did the countenance divine

1347,41,
1348,41,"no no let us play, for it is yet day"
1349,41,and we cannot go to sleep
1350,41,"besides in the sky, the little birds fly"
1351,41,and the hills are all covered with sheep
1352,41,
1353,41,well well go & play till the light fades away
1354,41,and then go home to bed
1355,41,the little ones leaped & shouted & laugh'd
1356,41,and all the hills echoed
1357,42,"when the voices of children, are heard on the green"
1358,42,"and whisprings are in the dale,"
1359,42,"the days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,"
1360,42,"my face turns green and pale,"
1361,42,
1362,42,"then come home my children, the sun is gone down"
1363,42,and the dews of night arise
1364,42,"your spring & your day, are wasted in play"
1365,42,"and your winter and night in disguise,"

1367,43,and not be in sorrow too?
1368,43,"can i see anothers grief,"
1369,43,"and not seek for kind relief,"
1370,43,
1371,43,"can i see a falling tear,"
1372,43,"and not feel my sorrows share,"
1373,43,"can a father see his child,"

1376,43,"can a mother sit and hear,"
1377,43,an infant groan an infant fear--
1378,43,"no no never can it be,"
1379,43,"never never can it be,"

1383,43,hear the small bird's grief & care
1384,43,hear the woes that infants bear--
1385,43,
1386,43,and not sit beside the nest
1387,43,"pouring pity in their breast,"
1388,43,and not sit the cradle near

1390,43,
1391,43,"and not sit both night & day,"
1392,43,"wiping all our tears away,"

1410,44,"piping down the valleys wild,"
1411,44,"piping songs of pleasant glee,"
1412,44,"on a cloud i saw a child,"
1413,44,"and he laughing said to me,"
1414,44,
1415,44,pipe a song about a lamb!
1416,44,"so i piped with merry cheer,"
1417,44,"piper, pipe that song again,"
1418,44,"so i piped, he wept to hear,"
1419,44,
1420,44,"drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;"
1421,44,"sing thy songs of happy cheer,"
1422,44,"so i sung the same again,"
1423,44,"while he wept with joy to hear,"
1424,44,
1425,44,"piper, sit thee down and write"
1426,44,"in a book, that all may read,"
1427,44,"so he vanished from my sight,"
1428,44,"and i plucked a hollow reed,"
1429,44,
1430,44,"and i made a rural pen,"
1431,44,"and i stained the water clear,"
1432,44,and i wrote my happy songs
1433,44,"every child may joy to hear,"
1434,45,"the shadowy daughter of urthona stood before red orc,"
1435,45,"    when fourteen suns had faintly journey'd o'er his dark abode,"
1436,45,"    his food she brought in iron baskets, his drink in cups of iron,"
1437,45,    crown'd with a helmet and dark hair the nameless female stood;
1438,45,"    a quiver with its burning stores, a bow like that of night,"
1439,45,"    when pestilence is shot from heaven, no other arms she need!"
1440,45,"    invulnerable though naked, save where clouds roll round her loins"
1441,45,"    their awful folds in the dark air, silent she stood as night;"
1442,45,"    for never from her iron tongue could voice or sound arise,"
1443,45,"    but dumb till that dread day when orc assay'd his fierce embrace,"
1444,45,"    dark virgin, said the hairy youth, thy father stern, abhorr'd,"
1445,45,    rivets my tenfold chains while still on high my spirit soars;
1446,45,"    sometimes an eagle screaming in the sky, sometimes a lion"
1447,45,"    stalking upon the mountains, and sometimes a whale, i lash"
1448,45,    the raging fathomless abyss; anon a serpent folding
1449,45,"    around the pillars of urthona, and round thy dark limbs"
1450,45,"    on the canadian wilds i fold; feeble my spirit folds,"
1451,45,"    for chain'd beneath i rend these caverns, when thou bringest food"
1452,45,"    i howl my joy, and my red eyes seek to behold thy face--"
1453,45,"    in vain! these clouds roll to and fro, and hide thee from my sight,"
1454,45,"    silent as despairing love, and strong as jealousy,"
1455,45,    the hairy shoulders rend the links; free are the wrists of fire;
1456,45,"    round the terrific loins he seiz'd the panting, struggling womb;"
1457,45,"    it joy'd, she put aside her clouds and smiled her first-born smile,"
1458,45,"    as when a black cloud shews its lightnings to the silent deep,"
1459,45,"    soon as she saw the terrible boy, then burst the virgin cry,"
1460,45,"    i know thee, i have found thee, and i will not let thee go,"
1461,45,"    thou art the image of god who dwells in darkness of africa,"
1462,45,"    and thou art fall'n to give me life in regions of dark death,"
1463,45,    on my american plains i feel the struggling afflictions
1464,45,"    endur'd by roots that writhe their arms into the nether deep,"
1465,45,"    i see a serpent in canada who courts me to his love,"
1466,45,"    in mexico an eagle, and a lion in peru;"
1467,45,"    i see a whale in the south-sea, drinking my soul away,"
1468,45,    o what limb-rending pains i feel! thy fire and my frost
1469,45,"    mingle in howling pains, in furrows by thy lightnings rent,"
1470,45,"    this is eternal death, and this the torment long foretold,"
1471,46,"the nameless shadowy female rose from out the breast of orc,"
1472,46,    her snaky hair brandishing in the winds of enitharmon;
1473,46,"    and thus her voice arose,"
1474,46,"    o mother enitharmon, wilt thou bring forth other sons?"
1475,46,"    to cause my name to vanish, that my place may not be found,"
1476,46,"    for i am faint with travail,"
1477,46,"    like the dark cloud disburden'd in the day of dismal thunder,"
1478,46,"    my roots are brandish'd in the heavens, my fruits in earth beneath"
1479,46,"    surge, foam and labour into life, first born and first consum'd!"
1480,46,   consumed and consuming!
1481,46,"   then why shouldst thou, accursed mother, bring me into life?"
1482,46,"   i wrap my turban of thick clouds around my lab'ring head,"
1483,46,   and fold the sheety waters as a mantle round my limbs;
1484,46,   yet the red sun and moon
1485,46,"   and all the overflowing stars rain down prolific pains,"
1486,46,"   unwilling i look up to heaven, unwilling count the stars,"
1487,46,   sitting in fathomless abyss of my immortal shrine
1488,46,   i seize their burning power
1489,46,"   and bring forth howling terrors, all devouring fiery kings,"
1490,46,"   devouring and devoured, roaming on dark and desolate mountains,"
1491,46,"   in forests of eternal death, shrieking in hollow trees,"
1492,46,   ah mother enitharmon!
1493,46,"   stamp not with solid form this vig'rous progeny of fires,"
1494,46,"   i bring forth from my teeming bosom myriads of flames,"
1495,46,   and thou dost stamp them with a signet; then they roam abroad
1496,46,"   and leave me void as death,"
1497,46,"   ah! i am drown'd in shady woe and visionary joy,"
1498,46,   and who shall bind the infinite with an eternal band?
1499,46,   to compass it with swaddling bands? and who shall cherish it
1500,46,   with milk and honey?
1501,46,"   i see it smile, and i roll inward, and my voice is past,"
1502,46,"       she ceased, and roll'd her shady clouds"
1503,46,"       into the secret place,"
1504,47,"in seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy,"
1505,47,"    drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead,"
1506,47,"    the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,"
1507,47,"    prudence is a rich, ugly old maid courted by incapacity,"
1508,47,"    he who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence,"
1509,47,"    the cut worm forgives the plow,"
1510,47,"    dip him in the river who loves water,"
1511,47,"    a fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees,"
1512,47,"    he whose face gives no light, shall never become a star,"
1513,47,"  eternity is in love with the productions of time,"
1514,47,"  the busy bee has no time for sorrow,"
1515,47,"  the hours of folly are measur'd by the clock; but of wisdom, no clock can measure,"
1516,47,"  all wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap,"
1517,47,"  bring out number, weight and measure in a year of dearth,"
1518,47,"  no bird soars too high, if he soars with his own wings,"
1519,47,"  a dead body revenges not injuries,"
1520,47,"  the most sublime act is to set another before you,"
1521,47,"  if the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise,"
1522,47,"  folly is the cloak of knavery,"
1523,47,"  shame is pride's cloke,"
1524,47,"  prisons are built with stones of law, brothels with bricks of religion,"
1525,47,"  the pride of the peacock is the glory of god,"
1526,47,"  the lust of the goat is the bounty of god,"
1527,47,"  the wrath of the lion is the wisdom of god,"
1528,47,"  the nakedness of woman is the work of god,"
1529,47,"  excess of sorrow laughs, excess of joy weeps,"
1530,47,"  the roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of eternity, too great for the eye of man,"
1531,47,"  the fox condemns the trap, not himself,"
1532,47,"  joys impregnate, sorrows bring forth,"
1533,47,"  let man wear the fell of the lion, woman the fleece of the sheep,"
1534,47,"  the bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship,"
1535,47,"  the selfish, smiling fool, and the sullen, frowning fool shall be both thought wise, that they may be a rod,"
1536,47,"  what is now proved was once only imagin'd,"
1537,47,"  the rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbit watch the roots; the lion, the tyger, the horse, the elephant watch the fruits,"
1538,47,"  the cistern contains, the fountain overflows,"
1539,47,"  one thought fills immensity,"
1540,47,"  always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you,"
1541,47,"  every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth,"
1542,47,"  the eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow,"
1543,47,"  the fox provides for himself, but god provides for the lion,"
1544,47,"  think in the morning, act in the noon, eat in the evening, sleep in the night,"
1545,47,"  he who has suffer'd you to impose on him, knows you,"
1546,47,"  as the plow follows words, so god rewards prayers,"
1547,47,"  the tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction,"
1548,47,"  expect poison from the standing water,"
1549,47,"  you never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough,"
1550,47,  listen to the fool's reproach! it is a kingly title!
1551,47,"  the eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard of earth,"
1552,47,"  the weak in courage is strong in cunning,"
1553,47,"  the apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow; nor the lion, the horse, how he shall take his prey,"
1554,47,"  the thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest,"
1555,47,"  if others had not been foolish, we should be so,"
1556,47,"  the soul of sweet delight can never be defil'd,"
1557,47,"  when thou seest an eagle, thou seest a portion of genius; lift up thy head!"
1558,47,"  as the caterpiller chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys,"
1559,47,"  to create a little flower is the labour of ages,"
1560,47,"  damn braces, bless relaxes,"
1561,47,"  the best wine is the oldest, the best water the newest,"
1562,47,  prayers plow not! praises reap not!
1563,47,  joys laugh not! sorrows weep not!
1564,47,"  the head sublime, the heart pathos, the genitals beauty, the hands and feet proportion,"
1565,47,"  as the air to a bird or the sea to a fish, so is contempt to the contemptible,"
1566,47,"  the crow wish'd every thing was black, the owl that every thing was white,"
1567,47,"  exuberance is beauty,"
1568,47,"  if the lion was advised by the fox, he would be cunning,"
1569,47,"  improvement makes strait roads; but the crooked roads without improvement are roads of genius,"
1570,47,"  sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires,"
1571,47,"  where man is not, nature is barren,"
1572,47,"  truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ'd,"
1573,47,"  enough! or too much,"
1574,48,what is it men in women do require?
1575,48,"the lineaments of gratified desire,"
1576,48,what is it women do in men require?
1577,48,"the lineaments of gratified desire,"
1578,48,
1579,48,the look of love alarms
1580,48,because 'tis fill'd with fire;
1581,48,but the look of soft deceit
1582,48,"shall win the lover's hire,"
1583,48,
1584,48,"soft deceit & idleness,"
1585,48,"these are beauty's sweetest dress,"
1586,48,
1587,48,he who binds to himself a joy
1588,48,dot the winged life destroy;
1589,48,but he who kisses the joy as it flies
1590,48,"lives in eternity's sunrise,"
1591,49,"silent, silent night,"
1592,49,quench the holy light
1593,49,of thy torches bright;
1594,49,
1595,49,for possessed of day
1596,49,thousand spirits stray
1597,49,"that sweet joys betray,"
1598,49,
1599,49,why should joys be sweet
1600,49,"used with deceit,"
1601,49,nor with sorrows meet?
1602,49,
1603,49,but an honest joy
1604,49,does itself destroy
1605,49,"for a harlot coy,"
1606,50,"my silks and fine array,"
1607,50,"my smiles and languish'd air,"
1608,50,by love are driv'n away;
1609,50,and mournful lean despair
1610,50,brings me yew to deck my grave;
1611,50,"such end true lovers have,"
1612,50,
1613,50,his face is fair as heav'n
1614,50,when springing buds unfold;
1615,50,o why to him was't giv'n
1616,50,whose heart is wintry cold?
1617,50,"his breast is love's all-worshipp'd tomb,"
1618,50,"where all love's pilgrims come,"
1619,50,
1620,50,"bring me an axe and spade,"
1621,50,bring me a winding sheet;
1622,50,when i my grave have made
1623,50,"let winds and tempests beat,"
1624,50,"then down i'll lie as cold as clay,"
1625,50,true love doth pass away!
1626,51,"memory, hither come,"
1627,51,       and tune your merry notes;
1628,51,"   and, while upon the wind"
1629,51,"       your music floats,"
1630,51,
1631,51,   i'll pore upon the stream
1632,51,"       where sighing lovers dream,"
1633,51,   and fish for fancies as they pass
1634,51,"       within the watery glass,"
1635,51,
1636,51,"   i'll drink of the clear stream,"
1637,51,      and hear the linnet's song;
1638,51,  and there i'll lie and dream
1639,51,"      the day along,"
1640,51,
1641,51,"  and, when night comes, i'll go"
1642,51,"      to places fit for woe,"
1643,51,  walking along the darken'd valley

1646,52,"who present, past, & future sees"
1647,52,whose ears have heard
1648,52,"the holy word,"
1649,52,"that walk'd among the ancient trees,"
1650,52,
1651,52,calling the lapsed soul
1652,52,and weeping in the evening dew;
1653,52,"that might control,"
1654,52,the starry pole;
1655,52,and fallen fallen light renew!

1676,53,"merrily merrily, to welcome in the year,"
1677,53,
1678,53,"     little boy,"
1679,53,     full of joy;

1691,53,     my white neck;
1692,53,     let me pull
1693,53,     your soft wool;
1694,53,     let me kiss
1695,53,     your soft face;
1696,53,"merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year,"
1697,54,i dreamt a dream!  what can it mean?
1698,54,and that i was a maiden queen
1699,54,"guarded by an angel mild,"
1700,54,witless woe was ne'er beguiled!
1701,54,
1702,54,"and i wept both night and day,"
1703,54,and he wiped my tears away;
1704,54,"and i wept both day and night,"
1705,54,"and hid from him my heart's delight,"
1706,54,
1707,54,"so he took his wings, and fled;"
1708,54,"then the morn blushed rosy red,"
1709,54,"i dried my tears, and armed my fears"
1710,54,"with ten-thousand shields and spears,"
1711,54,
1712,54,soon my angel came again;
1713,54,"i was armed, he came in vain;"
1714,54,"for the time of youth was fled,"
1715,54,"and grey hairs were on my head,"
1716,55,the angel that presided o'er my birth
1717,55,"said, little creature, form'd of joy and mirth,"
1718,55,"go love without the help of any thing on earth,"
1719,56,"he, where thou dwellest, in what grove,"

1765,58,
1766,58,"    to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day,"

1842,58,"  descend, o little cloud, and hover before the eyes of thel,"
1843,58,
1844,58,"      the cloud descended, and the lily bow'd her modest head"
1845,58,
1846,58,"  and went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass,"
1847,58,
1848,58,ii
1849,58,
1850,58,"    o little cloud, the virgin said, i charge thee tell to me"

1856,58,"    i pass away, yet i complain, and no one hears my voice,"
1857,58,
1858,58,"    the cloud then shew'd his golden head and his bright form emerg'd,"

1866,58,"    and fearest thou, because i vanish and am seen no more,"
1867,58,
1868,58,"  nothing remains? o maid, i tell thee, when i pass away"
1869,58,
1870,58,"  it is to tenfold life, to love, to peace and raptures holy,"
1871,58,
1872,58,"  unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers,"
1873,58,
1874,58,"  and court the fair-eyed dew to take me to her shining tent,"
1875,58,
1876,58,"  the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun,"

1882,58,"  dost thou, o little cloud? i fear that i am not like thee,"
1883,58,
1884,58,"  for i walk thro' the vales of har, and smell the sweetest flowers,"
1885,58,
1886,58,"  but i feed not the little flowers; i hear the warbling birds,"
1887,58,
1888,58,"  but i feed not the warbling birds; they fly and seek their food,"
1889,58,
1890,58,"  but thel delights in these no more, because i fade away;"
1891,58,
1892,58,"  and all shall say, 'without a use this shining woman liv'd,"
1893,58,
1894,58,  or did she only live to be at death the food of worms?' 
1895,58,
1896,58,"  the cloud reclin'd upon his airy throne and answer'd thus,"
1897,58,
1898,58,"  then if thou art the food of worms, o virgin of the skies,"
1899,58,
1900,58,"  how great thy use, how great thy blessing! every thing that lives"
1901,58,
1902,58,"  lives not alone nor for itself, fear not, and i will call"
1903,58,
1904,58,"  the weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice,"
1905,58,
1906,58,"  come forth, worm of the silent valley, to thy pensive queen,"
1907,58,
1908,58,"  the helpless worm arose, and sat upon the lily's leaf,"

1912,58,iii
1913,58,
1914,58,"    then thel astonish'd view'd the worm upon its dewy bed,"
1915,58,
1916,58,"    art thou a worm? image of weakness, art thou but a worm?"
1917,58,
1918,58,    i see thee like an infant wrapped in the lily's leaf
1919,58,
1920,58,"    ah! weep not, little voice, thou canst not speak, but thou canst weep,"
1921,58,
1922,58,"    is this a worm? i see thee lay helpless and naked, weeping,"
1923,58,
1924,58,"    and none to answer, none to cherish thee with mother's smiles,"
1925,58,
1926,58,"        the clod of clay heard the worm's voice and rais'd her pitying head,"
1927,58,
1928,58,"    she bow'd over the weeping infant, and her life exhal'd"
1929,58,
1930,58,"    in milky fondness, then on thel she fix'd her humble eyes,"
1931,58,
1932,58,"  o beauty of the vales of har! we live not for ourselves,"
1933,58,
1934,58,"  thou seest me the meanest thing, and so i am indeed,"
1935,58,
1936,58,"  my bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark;"
1937,58,
1938,58,"  but he, that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head,"
1939,58,
1940,58,"  and kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast,"
1941,58,
1942,58,"  and says, 'thou mother of my children, i have loved thee"
1943,58,
1944,58,"  and i have given thee a crown that none can take away,'"
1945,58,
1946,58,"  but how this is, sweet maid, i know not, and i cannot know;"
1947,58,
1948,58,"  i ponder, and i cannot ponder; yet i live and love,"
1949,58,
1950,58,"  the daughter of beauty wip'd her pitying tears with her white veil,"
1951,58,
1952,58,"  and said, alas! i knew not this, and therefore did i weep,"
1953,58,
1954,58,"  that god would love a worm i knew, and punish the evil foot"
1955,58,
1956,58,  that wilful bruis'd its helpless form; but that he cherish'd it
1957,58,
1958,58,"  with milk and oil i never knew, and therefore did i weep;"
1959,58,
1960,58,"  and i complain'd in the mild air, because i fade away,"
1961,58,
1962,58,"  and lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot,"
1963,58,
1964,58,"  queen of the vales, the matron clay answer'd, i heard thy sighs,"
1965,58,
1966,58,"  and all thy moans flew o'er my roof, but i have call'd them down,"
1967,58,
1968,58,"  wilt thou, o queen, enter my house? 'tis given thee to enter"

1979,58,
1980,58,"    of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists,"
1981,58,
1982,58,"    a land of sorrows and of tears where never smile was seen,"
1983,58,
1984,58,"    she wander'd in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, list'ning"
1985,58,
1986,58,    dolours and lamentations; waiting oft beside a dewy grave
1987,58,
1988,58,"    she stood in silence, list'ning to the voices of the ground,"
1989,58,
1990,58,"    till to her own grave plot she came, and there she sat down,"
1991,58,
1992,58,"  and heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit,"
1993,58,
1994,58,  why cannot the ear be closed to its own destruction?
1995,58,
1996,58,  or the glist'ning eye to the poison of a smile?
1997,58,
1998,58,"  why are eyelids stor'd with arrows ready drawn,"
1999,58,
2000,58,  where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie?
2001,58,
2002,58,  or an eye of gifts and graces show'ring fruits and coined gold?
2003,58,
2004,58,  why a tongue impress'd with honey from every wind?
2005,58,
2006,58,"  why an ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?"
2007,58,
2008,58,"  why a nostril wide inhaling terror, trembling, and affright?"
2009,58,
2010,58,  why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy?
2011,58,
2012,58,  why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?
2013,58,
2014,58,"  the virgin started from her seat, and with a shriek"
2015,58,
2016,58,"  fled back unhinder'd till she came into the vales of har,"

2028,59,in his desolate mountains rifted furious
2029,59,by the black winds of perturbation

2151,61,long periods in burning fires labouring
2152,61,"till hoary, and age-broke, and aged,"
2153,61,"in despair and the shadows of death,"
2154,61,
2155,61,"7, and a roof, vast petrific around,"
2156,61,"on all sides he fram'd, like a womb;"
2157,61,where thousands of rivers in veins
2158,61,of blood pour down the mountains to cool
2159,61,the eternal fires beating without
2160,61,from eternals; & like a black globe
2161,61,"view'd by sons of eternity, standing"
2162,61,on the shore of the infinite ocean
2163,61,like a human heart struggling & beating
2164,61,"the vast world of urizen appear'd,"
2165,61,
2166,61,"8, and los round the dark globe of urizen,"
2167,61,"kept watch for eternals to confine,"
2168,61,the obscure separation alone;
2169,61,"for eternity stood wide apart,"
2170,61,as the stars are apart from the earth
2171,61,
2172,61,"9, los wept howling around the dark demon,"
2173,61,"and cursing his lot; for in anguish,"
2174,61,urizen was rent from his side;
2175,61,and a fathomless void for his feet;
2176,61,"and intense fires for his dwelling,"
2177,61,
2178,61,"10, but urizen laid in a stony sleep"
2179,61,"unorganiz'd, rent from eternity"
2180,61,
2181,61,"11, the eternals said, what is this? death"
2182,61,"urizen is a clod of clay,"
2183,61,
2184,61,"12, los howld in a dismal stupor,"
2185,61,groaning! gnashing! groaning!
2186,61,till the wrenching apart was healed
2187,61,
2188,61,"13, but the wrenching of urizen heal'd not"
2189,61,"cold, featureless, flesh or clay,"
2190,61,rifted with direful changes
2191,61,he lay in a dreamless night
2192,61,
2193,61,"14, till los rouz'd his fires, affrighted"
2194,61,"at the formless unmeasurable death,"
2195,62,a
2196,62,
2197,62,"1, los smitten with astonishment"
2198,62,frightend at the hurtling bones
2199,62,
2200,62,"2, and at the surging sulphureous"
2201,62,perturbed immortal mad raging
2202,62,
2203,62,"3, in whirlwinds & pitch & nitre"
2204,62,round the furious limbs of los
2205,62,
2206,62,"4, and los formed nets & gins"
2207,62,and threw the nets round about
2208,62,
2209,62,"5, he watch'd in shuddering fear"
2210,62,the dark changes & bound every change
2211,62,with rivets of iron & brass;
2212,62,
2213,62,"6, and these were the changes of urizen,"
2214,62,
2215,62,"b,"
2216,62,
2217,62,"1, ages on ages roll'd over him!"
2218,62,in stony sleep ages roll'd over him!
2219,62,like a dark waste stretching chang'able
2220,62,"by earthquakes riv'n, belching sullen fires"
2221,62,on ages roll'd ages in ghastly
2222,62,sick torment; around him in whirlwinds
2223,62,of darkness the eternal prophet howl'd
2224,62,beating still on his rivets of iron
2225,62,pouring sodor of iron; dividing
2226,62,"the horrible night into watches,"
2227,62,
2228,62,"2, and urizen so his eternal name"
2229,62,his prolific delight obscurd more & more
2230,62,in dark secrecy hiding in surging
2231,62,"sulphureous fluid his phantasies,"
2232,62,"the eternal prophet heavd the dark bellows,"
2233,62,and turn'd restless the tongs; and the hammer
2234,62,incessant beat; forging chains new & new
2235,62,"numb'ring with links, hours, days & years"
2236,62,
2237,62,"3, the eternal mind bounded began to roll"
2238,62,"eddies of wrath ceaseless round & round,"
2239,62,and the sulphureous foam surging thick
2240,62,"settled, a lake, bright, & shining clear,"
2241,62,"white as the snow on the mountains cold,"
2242,62,
2243,62,"4, forgetfulness, dumbness, necessity!"
2244,62,"in chains of the mind locked up,"
2245,62,like fetters of ice shrinking together
2246,62,"disorganiz'd, rent from eternity,"
2247,62,los beat on his fetters of iron;
2248,62,and heated his furnaces & pour'd
2249,62,iron sodor and sodor of brass
2250,62,
2251,62,"5, restless turnd the immortal inchain'd"
2252,62,heaving dolorous! anguish'd! unbearable
2253,62,till a roof shaggy wild enclosed
2254,62,"in an orb, his fountain of thought,"
2255,62,
2256,62,"6, in a horrible dreamful slumber;"
2257,62,like the linked infernal chain;
2258,62,a vast spine writh'd in torment
2259,62,upon the winds; shooting pain'd
2260,62,"ribs, like a bending cavern"
2261,62,"and bones of solidness, froze"
2262,62,"over all his nerves of joy,"
2263,62,"and a first age passed over,"
2264,62,"and a state of dismal woe,"
2265,62,
2266,62,"7, from the caverns of his jointed spine,"
2267,62,down sunk with fright a red
2268,62,round globe hot burning deep
2269,62,"deep down into the abyss,"
2270,62,"panting, conglobing, trembling"
2271,62,shooting out ten thousand branches
2272,62,"around his solid bones,"
2273,62,"and a second age passed over,"
2274,62,"and a state of dismal woe,"
2275,62,
2276,62,"8, in harrowing fear rolling round;"
2277,62,his nervous brain shot branches
2278,62,"round the branches of his heart,"
2279,62,on high into two little orbs
2280,62,and fixed in two little caves
2281,62,"hiding carefully from the wind,"
2282,62,"his eyes beheld the deep,"
2283,62,"and a third age passed over,"
2284,62,"and a state of dismal woe,"
2285,62,
2286,62,"9, the pangs of hope began,"
2287,62,"in heavy pain striving, struggling,"
2288,62,"two ears in close volutions,"
2289,62,from beneath his orbs of vision
2290,62,shot spiring out and petrified
2291,62,"as they grew, and a fourth age passed"
2292,62,"and a state of dismal woe,"
2293,62,
2294,62,"10, in ghastly torment sick;"
2295,62,hanging upon the wind;
2296,62,"two nostrils bent down to the deep,"
2297,62,and a fifth age passed over;
2298,62,"and a state of dismal woe,"
2299,62,
2300,62,"11, in ghastly torment sick;"
2301,62,"within his ribs bloated round,"
2302,62,a craving hungry cavern;
2303,62,"thence arose his channeld throat,"
2304,62,and like a red flame a tongue
2305,62,"of thirst & of hunger appeard,"
2306,62,"and a sixth age passed over,"
2307,62,"and a state of dismal woe,"
2308,62,
2309,62,"12, enraged & stifled with torment"
2310,62,he threw his right arm to the north
2311,62,his left arm to the south
2312,62,"shooting out in anguish deep,"
2313,62,and his feet stampd the nether abyss
2314,62,"in trembling & howling & dismay,"
2315,62,"and a seventh age passed over,"
2316,62,"and a state of dismal woe,"
2317,63,"1, then the inhabitants of those cities,"
2318,63,felt their nerves change into marrow
2319,63,and hardening bones began
2320,63,"in swift diseases and torments,"
2321,63,in throbbings & shootings & grindings
2322,63,thro' all the coasts; till weaken'd
2323,63,"the senses inward rush'd shrinking,"
2324,63,"beneath the dark net of infection,"
2325,63,
2326,63,"2, till the shrunken eyes clouded over"
2327,63,discernd not the woven hipocrisy
2328,63,but the streaky slime in their heavens
2329,63,brought together by narrowing perceptions
2330,63,appeard transparent air; for their eyes
2331,63,grew small like the eyes of a man
2332,63,and in reptile forms shrinking together
2333,63,of seven feet stature they remaind
2334,63,
2335,63,"3, six days they shrunk up from existence"
2336,63,and on the seventh day they rested
2337,63,"and they bless'd the seventh day, in sick hope,"
2338,63,and forgot their eternal life
2339,63,
2340,63,"4, and their thirty cities divided"
2341,63,in form of a human heart
2342,63,no more could they rise at will
2343,63,"in the infinite void, but bound down"
2344,63,to earth by their narrowing perceptions
2345,63,they lived a period of years
2346,63,then left a noisom body
2347,63,to the jaws of devouring darkness
2348,63,
2349,63,"5, and their children wept, & built"
2350,63,"tombs in the desolate places,"
2351,63,"and form'd laws of prudence, and call'd them"
2352,63,the eternal laws of god
2353,63,
2354,63,"6, and the thirty cities remaind"
2355,63,"surrounded by salt floods, now call'd"
2356,63,"africa, its name was then egypt,"
2357,63,
2358,63,"7, the remaining sons of urizen"
2359,63,beheld their brethren shrink together
2360,63,beneath the net of urizen;
2361,63,perswasion was in vain;
2362,63,"for the ears of the inhabitants,"
2363,63,"were wither'd, & deafen'd, & cold,"
2364,63,"and their eyes could not discern,"
2365,63,"their brethren of other cities,"
2366,63,
2367,63,"8, so fuzon call'd all together"
2368,63,"the remaining children of urizen,"
2369,63,"and they left the pendulous earth,"
2370,63,"they called it egypt, & left it,"
2371,63,
2372,63,"9, and the salt ocean rolled englob'd,"
2373,64,"1, in terrors los shrunk from his task,"
2374,64,"his great hammer fell from his hand,"
2375,64,"his fires beheld, and sickening,"
2376,64,"hid their strong limbs in smoke,"
2377,64,for with noises ruinous loud;
2378,64,with hurtlings & clashings & groans
2379,64,"the immortal endur'd his chains,"
2380,64,"tho' bound in a deadly sleep,"
2381,64,
2382,64,"2, all the myriads of eternity,"
2383,64,"all the wisdom & joy of life,"
2384,64,"roll like a sea around him,"
2385,64,except what his little orbs
2386,64,"of sight by degrees unfold,"
2387,64,
2388,64,"3, and now his eternal life"
2389,64,like a dream was obliterated
2390,64,
2391,64,"4, shudd'ring, the eternal prophet smote"
2392,64,"with a stroke, from his north to south region"
2393,64,the bellows & hammer are silent now
2394,64,"a nerveless silence, his prophetic voice"
2395,64,siez'd; a cold solitude & dark void
2396,64,the eternal prophet & urizen clos'd
2397,64,
2398,64,"5, ages on ages rolld over them"
2399,64,cut off from life & light frozen
2400,64,into horrible forms of deformity
2401,64,los suffer'd his fires to decay
2402,64,then he look'd back with anxious desire
2403,64,but the space undivided by existence
2404,64,"struck horror into his soul,"
2405,64,
2406,64,"6, los wept obscur'd with mourning,"
2407,64,his bosom earthquak'd with sighs;
2408,64,"he saw urizen deadly black,"
2409,64,"in his chains bound, & pity began,"
2410,64,
2411,64,"7, in anguish dividing & dividing"
2412,64,for pity divides the soul
2413,64,in pangs eternity on eternity
2414,64,life in cataracts pourd down his cliffs
2415,64,the void shrunk the lymph into nerves
2416,64,wand'ring wide on the bosom of night
2417,64,and left a round globe of blood
2418,64,trembling upon the void
2419,64,thus the eternal prophet was divided
2420,64,before the death-image of urizen
2421,64,for in changeable clouds and darkness
2422,64,"in a winterly night beneath,"
2423,64,"the abyss of los stretch'd immense,"
2424,64,"and now seen, now obscur'd, to the eyes"
2425,64,"of eternals, the visions remote"
2426,64,"of the dark separation appear'd,"
2427,64,as glasses discover worlds
2428,64,"in the endless abyss of space,"
2429,64,so the expanding eyes of immortals
2430,64,"beheld the dark visions of los,"
2431,64,and the globe of life blood trembling
2432,64,
2433,64,"8, the globe of life blood trembled"
2434,64,branching out into roots;
2435,64,"fib'rous, writhing upon the winds;"
2436,64,"fibres of blood, milk and tears;"
2437,64,"in pangs, eternity on eternity,"
2438,64,at length in tears & cries imbodied
2439,64,a female form trembling and pale
2440,64,waves before his deathy face
2441,64,
2442,64,"9, all eternity shudderd at sight"
2443,64,of the first female now separate
2444,64,pale as a cloud of snow
2445,64,waving before the face of los
2446,64,
2447,64,"10, wonder, awe, fear, astonishment,"
2448,64,petrify the eternal myriads;
2449,64,at the first female form now separate
2450,64,"they call'd her pity, and fled"
2451,64,
2452,64,"11, spread a tent, with strong curtains around them"
2453,64,let cords & stakes bind in the void
2454,64,that eternals may no more behold them
2455,64,
2456,64,"12, they began to weave curtains of darkness"
2457,64,they erected large pillars round the void
2458,64,with golden hooks fastend in the pillars
2459,64,with infinite labour the eternals
2460,64,"a woof wove, and called it science"
2461,65,"1, but los saw the female & pitied"
2462,65,"he embrac'd her, she wept, she refus'd"
2463,65,in perverse and cruel delight
2464,65,"she fled from his arms, yet he followd"
2465,65,
2466,65,"2, eternity shudder'd when they saw,"
2467,65,"man begetting his likeness,"
2468,65,"on his own divided image,"
2469,65,
2470,65,"3, a time passed over, the eternals"
2471,65,began to erect the tent;
2472,65,"when enitharmon sick,"
2473,65,"felt a worm within her womb,"
2474,65,
2475,65,"4, yet helpless it lay like a worm"
2476,65,in the trembling womb
2477,65,to be moulded into existence
2478,65,
2479,65,"5, all day the worm lay on her bosom"
2480,65,all night within her womb
2481,65,the worm lay till it grew to a serpent
2482,65,with dolorous hissings & poisons
2483,65,"round enitharmons loins folding,"
2484,65,
2485,65,"6, coild within enitharmons womb"
2486,65,"the serpent grew casting its scales,"
2487,65,with sharp pangs the hissings began
2488,65,"to change to a grating cry,"
2489,65,"many sorrows and dismal throes,"
2490,65,"many forms of fish, bird & beast,"
2491,65,brought forth an infant form
2492,65,"where was a worm before,"
2493,65,
2494,65,"7, the eternals their tent finished"
2495,65,alarm'd with these gloomy visions
2496,65,when enitharmon groaning
2497,65,"produc'd a man child to the light,"
2498,65,
2499,65,"8, a shriek ran thro' eternity,"
2500,65,and a paralytic stroke;
2501,65,"at the birth of the human shadow,"
2502,65,
2503,65,"9, delving earth in his resistless way;"
2504,65,"howling, the child with fierce flames"
2505,65,"issu'd from enitharmon,"
2506,65,
2507,65,"10, the eternals, closed the tent"
2508,65,they beat down the stakes the cords
2509,65,stretch'd for a work of eternity;
2510,65,"no more los beheld eternity,"
2511,65,
2512,65,"11, in his hands he seiz'd the infant"
2513,65,he bathed him in springs of sorrow
2514,65,"he gave him to enitharmon,"
2515,66,"1, they named the child orc, he grew"
2516,66,fed with milk of enitharmon
2517,66,
2518,66,"2, los awoke her; o sorrow & pain!"
2519,66,"a tight'ning girdle grew,"
2520,66,"around his bosom, in sobbings"
2521,66,"he burst the girdle in twain,"
2522,66,but still another girdle
2523,66,"opressd his bosom, in sobbings"
2524,66,"again he burst it, again"
2525,66,another girdle succeeds
2526,66,the girdle was form'd by day;
2527,66,"by night was burst in twain,"
2528,66,
2529,66,"3, these falling down on the rock"
2530,66,into an iron chain
2531,66,in each other link by link lock'd
2532,66,
2533,66,"4, they took orc to the top of a mountain,"
2534,66,o how enitharmon wept!
2535,66,they chain'd his young limbs to the rock
2536,66,with the chain of jealousy
2537,66,beneath urizens deathful shadow
2538,66,
2539,66,"5, the dead heard the voice of the child"
2540,66,and began to awake from sleep
2541,66,"all things, heard the voice of the child"
2542,66,"and began to awake to life,"
2543,66,
2544,66,"6, and urizen craving with hunger"
2545,66,stung with the odours of nature
2546,66,explor'd his dens around
2547,66,
2548,66,"7, he form'd a line & a plummet"
2549,66,"to divide the abyss beneath,"
2550,66,"he form'd a dividing rule,"
2551,66,
2552,66,"8, he formed scales to weigh;"
2553,66,he formed massy weights;
2554,66,he formed a brazen quadrant;
2555,66,he formed golden compasses
2556,66,and began to explore the abyss
2557,66,and he planted a garden of fruits
2558,66,
2559,66,"9, but los encircled enitharmon"
2560,66,with fires of prophecy
2561,66,"from the sight of urizen & orc,"
2562,66,
2563,66,"10, and she bore an enormous race"
2564,67,"1, urizen explor'd his dens"
2565,67,"mountain, moor, & wilderness,"
2566,67,with a globe of fire lighting his journey
2567,67,"a fearful journey, annoy'd"
2568,67,"by cruel enormities, forms"
2569,67,of life on his forsaken mountains
2570,67,
2571,67,"2, and his world teemd vast enormities"
2572,67,frightning; faithless; fawning
2573,67,portions of life; similitudes
2574,67,"of a foot, or a hand, or a head"
2575,67,"or a heart, or an eye, they swam mischevous"
2576,67,dread terrors! delighting in blood
2577,67,
2578,67,"3, most urizen sicken'd to see"
2579,67,his eternal creations appear
2580,67,sons & daughters of sorrow on mountains
2581,67,weeping! wailing! first thiriel appear'd
2582,67,astonish'd at his own existence
2583,67,"like a man from a cloud born, & utha"
2584,67,"from the waters emerging, laments!"
2585,67,grodna rent the deep earth howling
2586,67,amaz'd! his heavens immense cracks
2587,67,like the ground parch'd with heat; then fuzon
2588,67,"flam'd out! first begotten, last born,"
2589,67,all his eternal sons in like manner

2591,67,"from monsters, & worms of the pit,"
2592,67,
2593,67,"4, he in darkness clos'd, view'd all his race,"
2594,67,and his soul sicken'd! he curs'd
2595,67,both sons & daughters; for he saw
2596,67,that no flesh nor spirit could keep
2597,67,"his iron laws one moment,"
2598,67,
2599,67,"5, for he saw that life liv'd upon death"
2600,67,the ox in the slaughter house moans
2601,67,the dog at the wintry door
2602,67,"and he wept, & he called it pity"
2603,67,and his tears flowed down on the winds
2604,67,
2605,67,"6, cold he wander'd on high, over their cities"
2606,67,in weeping & pain & woe!
2607,67,and where-ever he wanderd in sorrows
2608,67,upon the aged heavens
2609,67,a cold shadow follow'd behind him
2610,67,"like a spiders web, moist, cold, & dim"
2611,67,drawing out from his sorrowing soul
2612,67,"the dungeon-like heaven dividing,"
2613,67,where ever the footsteps of urizen
2614,67,"walk'd over the cities in sorrow,"
2615,67,
2616,67,"7, till a web dark & cold, throughout all"
2617,67,the tormented element stretch'd
2618,67,from the sorrows of urizens soul
2619,67,and the web is a female in embrio
2620,67,"none could break the web, no wings of fire,"
2621,67,
2622,67,"8, so twisted the cords, & so knotted"

2624,67,
2625,67,"9, and all calld it, the net of religion"
2626,68,"of the primeval priests assum'd power,"
2627,68,when eternals spurn'd back his religion;
2628,68,"and gave him a place in the north,"
2629,68,"obscure, shadowy, void, solitary,"
2630,68,
2631,68,"eternals i hear your call gladly,"
2632,68,"dictate swift winged words, & fear not"
2633,68,"to unfold your dark visions of torment,"
2634,69,"the caverns of the grave i've seen,"
2635,69,"and these i show'd to england's queen,"

2643,69,"till the heavens and earth are gone,"
2644,69,"still admir'd by noble minds,"
2645,69,"follow'd by envy on the winds,"
2646,69,"re-engrav'd time after time,"
2647,69,"ever in their youthful prime,"

2653,69,"there they shine eternally,"
2654,70,"a little black thing in the snow,"
2655,70,crying weep! weep! in notes of woe!
2656,70,where are thy father and mother? say!--
2657,70,"they are both gone up to the church to pray,"
2658,70,
2659,70,"because i was happy upon the heath,"
2660,70,"and smiled among the winter's snow,"
2661,70,"they clothed me in the clothes of death,"
2662,70,"and taught me to sing the notes of woe,"
2663,70,
2664,70,"and because i am happy and dance and sing,"
2665,70,"they think they have done me no injury,"
2666,70,"and are gone to praise god and his priest and king,"
2667,70,"who make up a heaven of our misery,"
2668,71,"when my mother died i was very young,"
2669,71,and my father sold me while yet my tongue
2670,71,could scarcely cry weep! weep! weep! weep!
2671,71,"so your chimneys i sweep, and in soot i sleep,"
2672,71,
2673,71,"there's little tom dacre, who cried when his head,"
2674,71,"that curled like a lamb's back, was shaved; so i said,"
2675,71,"hush, tom! never mind it, for, when your head's bare,"
2676,71,"you know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair,"
2677,71,
2678,71,"and so he was quiet, and that very night,"
2679,71,"as tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight! --"
2680,71,"that thousands of sweepers, dick, joe, ned, and jack,"
2681,71,"were all of them locked up in coffins of black,"
2682,71,
2683,71,"and by came an angel, who had a bright key,"
2684,71,"and he opened the coffins, and let them all free;"
2685,71,"then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,"
2686,71,"and wash in a river, and shine in the sun,"
2687,71,
2688,71,"then naked and white, all their bags left behind,"
2689,71,"they rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind;"
2690,71,"and the angel told tom, if he'd be a good boy,"
2691,71,"he'd have god for his father, and never want joy,"
2692,71,
2693,71,"and so tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,"
2694,71,"and got with our bags and our brushes to work,"
2695,71,"though the morning was cold, tom was happy and warm,"
2696,71,"so, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm,"

2711,73,"the maiden caught me in the wild,"
2712,73,where i was dancing merrily;

2851,76,"became a chariot of fire,  "
2852,76,"throughout the land he took his course,  "
2853,76,"and trac’d diseases to their source,        "
2854,76,"he curs’d the scribe and pharisee,  "
2855,76,"trampling down hypocrisy,  "
2856,76,"where’er his chariot took its way,  "
2857,76,"there gates of death let in the day,  "
2858,76,broke down from every chain and bar;        
2859,76,and satan in his spiritual war

2861,76,"the god of this world, louder roll’d  "
2862,76,"the chariot-wheels, and louder still  "
2863,76,"his voice was heard from zion’s hill,        "

2874,76,"to be worshipp’d by the church of rome,  "

2877,76,give any proofs of humility?  
2878,76,"boast of high things with humble tone,  "
2879,76,and give with charity a stone?        
2880,76,"when but a child he ran away,  "
2881,76,"and left his parents in dismay,  "
2882,76,when they had wander’d three days long  
2883,76,"these were the words upon his tongue,  "
2884,76,"‘no earthly parents i confess,        "
2885,76,"i am doing my father’s business,’  "
2886,76,when the rich learnèd pharisee

2888,76,upon his heart with iron pen  
2889,76,"he wrote ‘ye must be born again,’        "
2890,76,he was too proud to take a bribe;  
2891,76,"he spoke with authority, not like a scribe,  "
2892,76,he says with most consummate art  
2893,76,"‘follow me, i am meek and lowly of heart,  "
2894,76,as that is the only way to escape        
2895,76,"the miser’s net and the glutton’s trap,’  "
2896,76,what can be done with such desperate fools  
2897,76,who follow after the heathen schools?  
2898,76,i was standing by when jesus died;  
2899,76,"what i call’d humility, they call’d pride,        "
2900,76,"he who loves his enemies betrays his friends,  "
2901,76,this surely is not what jesus intends;  
2902,76,"but the sneaking pride of heroic schools,  "
2903,76,and the scribes’ and pharisees’ virtuous rules;  
2904,76,"for he acts with honest, triumphant pride,        "
2905,76,"and this is the cause that jesus dies,  "
2906,76,"he did not die with christian ease,  "
2907,76,"asking pardon of his enemies,  "
2908,76,"if he had, caiaphas would forgive;  "
2909,76,"sneaking submission can always live,        "
2910,76,"he had only to say that god was the devil,  "
2911,76,"and the devil was god, like a christian civil;  "
2912,76,mild christian regrets to the devil confess  
2913,76,for affronting him thrice in the wilderness;  
2914,76,"he had soon been bloody caesar’s elf,        "
2915,76,"and at last he would have been caesar himself,  "
2916,76,"like dr, priestly and bacon and newton—  "
2917,76,poor spiritual knowledge is not worth a button  
2918,76,"for thus the gospel sir isaac confutes,  "
2919,76,‘god can only be known by his attributes;      
2920,76,"and as for the indwelling of the holy ghost,  "
2921,76,"or of christ and his father, it’s all a boast  "
2922,76,"and pride, and vanity of the imagination,  "
2923,76,"that disdains to follow this world’s fashion,’  "
2924,76,to teach doubt and experiment        
2925,76,"certainly was not what christ meant,  "
2926,76,"what was he doing all that time,  "
2927,76,from twelve years old to manly prime?  
2928,76,"was he then idle, or the less  "
2929,76,about his father’s business?      
2930,76,or was his wisdom held in scorn  
2931,76,before his wrath began to burn  
2932,76,"in miracles throughout the land,  "
2933,76,that quite unnerv’d the seraph band?  
2934,76,"if he had been antichrist, creeping jesus,      "
2935,76,he’d have done anything to please us;  
2936,76,"gone sneaking into synagogues,  "
2937,76,and not us’d the elders and priests like dogs;  
2938,76,but humble as a lamb or ass  
2939,76,"obey’d himself to caiaphas,      "
2940,76,"god wants not man to humble himself,  "
2941,76,"that is the trick of the ancient elf,  "
2942,76,"this is the race that jesus ran,  "
2943,76,"humble to god, haughty to man,  "
2944,76,cursing the rulers before the people      
2945,76,"even to the temple’s highest steeple,  "
2946,76,and when he humbled himself to god  
2947,76,"then descended the cruel rod,  "
2948,76,"‘if thou humblest thyself, thou humblest me,  "
2949,76,"thou also dwell’st in eternity,      "
2950,76,"thou art a man, god is no more,  "
2951,76,"thy own humanity learn to adore,  "
2952,76,"for that is my spirit of life,  "
2953,76,"awake, arise to spiritual strife,  "
2954,76,and thy revenge abroad display      
2955,76,"in terrors at the last judgement day,  "
2956,76,god’s mercy and long suffering  
2957,76,"is but the sinner to judgement to bring,  "
2958,76,thou on the cross for them shalt pray—  
2959,76,"and take revenge at the last day,’      "
2960,76,"jesus replied, and thunders hurl’d,  "
2961,76,"‘i never will pray for the world,  "
2962,76,once i did so when i pray’d in the garden;  
2963,76,"i wish’d to take with me a bodily pardon,’  "
2964,76,"can that which was of woman born,      "
2965,76,"in the absence of the morn,  "
2966,76,"when the soul fell into sleep,  "
2967,76,"and archangels round it weep,  "
2968,76,shooting out against the light  
2969,76,"fibres of a deadly night,      "
2970,76,"reasoning upon its own dark fiction,  "
2971,76,in doubt which is self-contradiction?  
2972,76,"humility is only doubt,  "
2973,76,"and does the sun and moon blot out,  "
2974,76,rooting over with thorns and stems      
2975,76,"the buried soul and all its gems,  "
2976,76,this life’s five windows of the soul  
2977,76,"distorts the heavens from pole to pole,  "
2978,76,and leads you to believe a lie  
2979,76,"when you see with, not thro’, the eye      "
2980,76,"that was born in a night, to perish in a night,  "
2981,76,"when the soul slept in the beams of light,  "
2982,76,
2983,76,did jesus teach doubt? or did he  
2984,76,"give any lessons of philosophy,  "
2985,76,"charge visionaries with deceiving,      "
2986,76,or call men wise for not believing?…  
2987,76,
2988,76,was jesus born of a virgin pure  
2989,76,with narrow soul and looks demure?  
2990,76,if he intended to take on sin  
2991,76,"the mother should an harlot been,      "
2992,76,"just such a one as magdalen,  "
2993,76,"with seven devils in her pen,  "
2994,76,"or were jew virgins still more curs’d,  "
2995,76,and more sucking devils nurs’d?  
2996,76,or what was it which he took on      
2997,76,that he might bring salvation?  
2998,76,"a body subject to be tempted,  "
2999,76,from neither pain nor grief exempted;  
3000,76,or such a body as might not feel  
3001,76,the passions that with sinners deal?      
3002,76,"yes, but they say he never fell,  "
3003,76,"ask caiaphas; for he can tell,—  "
3004,76,"‘he mock’d the sabbath, and he mock’d  "
3005,76,"the sabbath’s god, and he unlock’d  "
3006,76,"the evil spirits from their shrines,        "
3007,76,and turn’d fishermen to divines;  
3008,76,"o’erturn’d the tent of secret sins,  "
3009,76,"and its golden cords and pins,  "
3010,76,in the bloody shrine of war  
3011,76,"pour’d around from star to star,—      "
3012,76,"halls of justice, hating vice,  "
3013,76,"where the devil combs his lice,  "
3014,76,he turn’d the devils into swine  
3015,76,that he might tempt the jews to dine;  
3016,76,"since which, a pig has got a look        "
3017,76,"that for a jew may be mistook,  "
3018,76,"“obey your parents,”—what says he?  "
3019,76,"“woman, what have i to do with thee?  "
3020,76,"no earthly parents i confess,  "
3021,76,"i am doing my father’s business,”        "
3022,76,"he scorn’d earth’s parents, scorn’d earth’s god,  "
3023,76,and mock’d the one and the other’s rod;  
3024,76,his seventy disciples sent  
3025,76,against religion and government—  
3026,76,"they by the sword of justice fell,      "
3027,76,"and him their cruel murderer tell,  "
3028,76,"he left his father’s trade to roam,  "
3029,76,a wand’ring vagrant without home;  
3030,76,"and thus he others’ labour stole,  "
3031,76,"that he might live above control,        "
3032,76,the publicans and harlots he  
3033,76,"selected for his company,  "
3034,76,and from the adulteress turn’d away  
3035,76,"god’s righteous law, that lost its prey,’  "
3036,76,was jesus chaste? or did he      
3037,76,give any lessons of chastity?  
3038,76,"the morning blushèd fiery red,  "
3039,76,mary was found in adulterous bed;  
3040,76,"earth groan’d beneath, and heaven above  "
3041,76,"trembled at discovery of love,      "
3042,76,"jesus was sitting in moses’ chair,  "
3043,76,"they brought the trembling woman there,  "
3044,76,"moses commands she be ston’d to death,  "
3045,76,what was the sound of jesus’ breath?  
3046,76,he laid his hand on moses’ law;      
3047,76,"the ancient heavens, in silent awe,  "
3048,76,"writ with curses from pole to pole,  "
3049,76,"all away began to roll,  "
3050,76,the earth trembling and naked lay  
3051,76,in secret bed of mortal clay;      
3052,76,on sinai felt the hand divine  
3053,76,pulling back the bloody shrine;  
3054,76,"and she heard the breath of god,  "
3055,76,"as she heard by eden’s flood,  "
3056,76,‘good and evil are no more!      
3057,76,sinai’s trumpets cease to roar!  
3058,76,"cease, finger of god, to write!  "
3059,76,"the heavens are not clean in thy sight,  "
3060,76,"thou art good, and thou alone;  "
3061,76,"nor may the sinner cast one stone,      "
3062,76,"to be good only, is to be  "
3063,76,"a god or else a pharisee,  "
3064,76,"thou angel of the presence divine,  "
3065,76,"that didst create this body of mine,  "
3066,76,wherefore hast thou writ these laws      
3067,76,and created hell’s dark jaws?  
3068,76,"my presence i will take from thee,  "
3069,76,"a cold leper thou shalt be,  "
3070,76,tho’ thou wast so pure and bright  
3071,76,"that heaven was impure in thy sight,        "
3072,76,"tho’ thy oath turn’d heaven pale,  "
3073,76,"tho’ thy covenant built hell’s jail,  "
3074,76,tho’ thou didst all to chaos roll  
3075,76,"with the serpent for its soul,  "
3076,76,"still the breath divine does move,        "
3077,76,"and the breath divine is love,  "
3078,76,"mary, fear not! let me see  "
3079,76,"the seven devils that torment thee,  "
3080,76,"hide not from my sight thy sin,  "
3081,76,"that forgiveness thou may’st win,        "
3082,76,has no man condemnèd thee?’  
3083,76,"‘no man, lord,’ ‘then what is he  "
3084,76,"who shall accuse thee? come ye forth,  "
3085,76,"fallen fiends of heavenly birth,  "
3086,76,"that have forgot your ancient love,        "
3087,76,"and driven away my trembling dove,  "
3088,76,you shall bow before her feet;  
3089,76,you shall lick the dust for meat;  
3090,76,"and tho’ you cannot love, but hate,  "
3091,76,"shall be beggars at love’s gate,        "
3092,76,what was thy love? let me see it;  
3093,76,was it love or dark deceit?’  
3094,76,‘love too long from me has fled;  
3095,76,"’twas dark deceit, to earn my bread;  "
3096,76,"’twas covet, or ’twas custom, or      "
3097,76,some trifle not worth caring for;  
3098,76,that they may call a shame and sin  
3099,76,"love’s temple that god dwelleth in,  "
3100,76,and hide in secret hidden shrine  
3101,76,"the naked human form divine,      "
3102,76,and render that a lawless thing  
3103,76,"on which the soul expands its wing,  "
3104,76,"but this, o lord, this was my sin,  "
3105,76,"when first i let these devils in,  "
3106,76,in dark pretence to chastity      
3107,76,"blaspheming love, blaspheming thee,  "
3108,76,"thence rose secret adulteries,  "
3109,76,"and thence did covet also rise,  "
3110,76,my sin thou hast forgiven me;  
3111,76,canst thou forgive my blasphemy?      
3112,76,"canst thou return to this dark hell,  "
3113,76,and in my burning bosom dwell?  
3114,76,and canst thou die that i may live?  
3115,76,and canst thou pity and forgive?’  
3116,76,then roll’d the shadowy man away      
3117,76,"from the limbs of jesus, to make them his prey,  "
3118,76,"an ever devouring appetite,  "
3119,76,glittering with festering venoms bright;  
3120,76,"crying ‘crucify this cause of distress,  "
3121,76,who don’t keep the secrets of holiness!      
3122,76,the mental powers by diseases we bind;  
3123,76,"but he heals the deaf, the dumb, and the blind,  "
3124,76,"whom god has afflicted for secret ends,  "
3125,76,"he comforts and heals and calls them friends,’  "
3126,76,"but, when jesus was crucified,      "
3127,76,"then was perfected his galling pride,  "
3128,76,"in three nights he devour’d his prey,  "
3129,76,and still he devours the body of clay;  
3130,76,"for dust and clay is the serpent’s meat,  "
3131,76,"which never was made for man to eat,        "
3132,76,
3133,76,"seeing this false christ, in fury and passion  "
3134,76,"i made my voice heard all over the nation,  "
3135,76,what are those…  
3136,76,
3137,76,"i am sure this jesus will not do,  "
3138,76,"either for englishman or jew,"
3139,77,"little fly,"
3140,77,thy summer's play
3141,77,my thoughtless hand
3142,77,"has brushed away,"
3143,77,
3144,77,am not i
3145,77,a fly like thee?
3146,77,or art not thou
3147,77,a man like me?
3148,77,
3149,77,for i dance
3150,77,"and drink, and sing,"
3151,77,till some blind hand
3152,77,"shall brush my wing,"
3153,77,
3154,77,if thought is life
3155,77,and strength and breath
3156,77,and the want
3157,77,of thought is death;
3158,77,
3159,77,then am i
3160,77,"a happy fly,"
3161,77,"if i live,"
3162,77,"or if i die,"
3163,78,what is the price of experience? do men buy it for a song?
3164,78,"    or wisdom for a dance in the street? no, it is bought with the price"
3165,78,"    of all that a man hath, his house, his wife, his children,"
3166,78,"    wisdom is sold in the desolate market where none come to buy,"
3167,78,"    and in the wither'd field where the farmer plows for bread in vain,"
3168,78,    it is an easy thing to triumph in the summer's sun
3169,78,"    and in the vintage and to sing on the waggon loaded with corn,"
3170,78,"    it is an easy thing to talk of patience to the afflicted,"
3171,78,"    to speak the laws of prudence to the houseless wanderer,"
3172,78,
3173,78,  to listen to the hungry raven's cry in wintry season
3174,78,"  when the red blood is fill'd with wine and with the marrow of lambs,"
3175,78,"  it is an easy thing to laugh at wrathful elements,"
3176,78,"  to hear the dog howl at the wintry door, the ox in the slaughter house moan;"
3177,78,  to see a god on every wind and a blessing on every blast;
3178,78,  to hear sounds of love in the thunder storm that destroys our enemies' house;
3179,78,"  to rejoice in the blight that covers his field, and the sickness that cuts off his children,"
3180,78,"  while our olive and vine sing and laugh round our door, and our children bring fruits and flowers,"
3181,78,"  then the groan and the dolor are quite forgotten, and the slave grinding at the mill,"
3182,78,"  and the captive in chains, and the poor in the prison, and the soldier in the field"
3183,78,"  when the shatter'd bone hath laid him groaning among the happier dead,"
3184,78,"  it is an easy thing to rejoice in the tents of prosperity,"
3185,78,"  thus could i sing and thus rejoice, but it is not so with me,"
3186,78,"  compel the poor to live upon a crust of bread, by soft mild arts,"
3187,78,
3188,78,"  smile when they frown, frown when they smile; and when a man looks pale"
3189,78,"  with labour and abstinence, say he looks healthy and happy;"
3190,78,"  and when his children sicken, let them die; there are enough"
3191,78,"  born, even too many, and our earth will be overrun"
3192,78,"  without these arts, if you would make the poor live with temper,"
3193,78,  with pomp give every crust of bread you give; with gracious cunning
3194,78,"  magnify small gifts; reduce the man to want a gift, and then give with pomp,"
3195,78,"  say he smiles if you hear him sigh, if pale, say he is ruddy,"
3196,78,
3197,78,"  preach temperance, say he is overgorg'd and drowns his wit"
3198,78,"  in strong drink, though you know that bread and water are all"
3199,78,"  he can afford, flatter his wife, pity his children, till we can"
3200,78,"  reduce all to our will, as spaniels are taught with art,"
3201,78,"  the sun has left his blackness and has found a fresher morning,"
3202,78,"  and the mild moon rejoices in the clear and cloudless night,"
3203,78,"  and man walks forth from midst of the fires, the evil is all consum'd,"
3204,78,  his eyes behold the angelic spheres arising night and day;
3205,78,"  the stars consum'd like a lamp blown out, and in their stead, behold"
3206,78,  the expanding eyes of man behold the depths of wondrous worlds!
3207,78,"  one earth, one sea beneath; nor erring globes wander, but stars"
3208,78,  of fire rise up nightly from the ocean; and one sun
3209,78,"  each morning, like a new born man, issues with songs and joy"
3210,78,
3211,78,"  calling the plowman to his labour and the shepherd to his rest,"
3212,78,
3213,78,"  he walks upon the eternal mountains, raising his heavenly voice,"
3214,78,"  conversing with the animal forms of wisdom night and day,"
3215,78,"  that, risen from the sea of fire, renew'd walk o'er the earth;"
3216,78,"  for tharmas brought his flocks upon the hills, and in the vales"
3217,78,"  around the eternal man's bright tent, the little children play"
3218,78,"  among the woolly flocks, the hammer of urthona sounds"
3219,78,"  in the deep caves beneath; his limbs renew'd, his lions roar"
3220,78,"  around the furnaces and in evening sport upon the plains,"
3221,78,
3222,78,"  they raise their faces from the earth, conversing with the man,"
3223,78,  how is it we have walk'd through fires and yet are not consum'd?
3224,78,"  how is it that all things are chang'd, even as in ancient times?"
3225,79,"thee the ancientest peer, duke of burgundy, rose from the monarch's right hand, red as wines"
3226,79,"   from his mountains; an odor of war, like a ripe vineyard, rose from his garments,"
3227,79,"   and the chamber became as a clouded sky; o'er the council he stretch'd his red limbs,"
3228,79,"   cloth'd in flames of crimson; as a ripe vineyard stretches over sheaves of corn,"
3229,79,"   the fierce duke hung over the council; around him crowd, weeping in his burning robe,"
3230,79,"   a bright cloud of infant souls; his words fall like purple autumn on the sheaves,"
3231,79,"   shall this marble built heaven become a clay cottage, this earth an oak stool and these mowers"
3232,79,   from the atlantic mountains mow down all this great starry harvest of six thousand years?
3233,79,"   and shall necker, the hind of geneva, stretch out his crook'd sickle o'er fertile france"
3234,79,"   till our purple and crimson is faded to russet, and the kingdoms of earth bound in sheaves,"
3235,79,"   and the ancient forests of chivalry hewn, and the joys of the combat burnt for fuel;"
3236,79,"   till the power and dominion is rent from the pole, sword and sceptre from sun and moon,"
3237,79,"   the law and gospel from fire and air, and eternal reason and science"
3238,79,"   from the deep and the solid, and man lay his faded head down on the rock"
3239,79,"   of eternity, where the eternal lion and eagle remain to devour?"
3240,79,"   this to prevent--urg'd by cries in day, and prophetic dreams hovering in night,"
3241,79,"    to enrich the lean earth that craves, furrow'd with plows, whose seed is departing from her--"
3242,79,"    thy nobles have gather'd thy starry hosts round this rebellious city,"
3243,79,"    to rouze up the ancient forests of europe, with clarions of cloud breathing war,"
3244,79,"    to hear the horse neigh to the drum and trumpet, and the trumpet and war shout reply,"
3245,79,"    stretch the hand that beckons the eagles of heaven; they cry over paris, and wait"
3246,79,    till fayette point his finger to versailles; the eagles of heaven must have their prey!
3247,79,"    he ceas'd, and burn'd silent; red clouds roll round necker; a weeping is heard o'er the palace,"
3248,79,"    like a dark cloud necker paus'd, and like thunder on the just man's burial day he paus'd;"
3249,79,"    silent sit the winds, silent the meadows, while the husbandman and woman of weakness"
3250,79,"    and bright children look after him into the grave, and water his clay with love,"
3251,79,"    then turn towards pensive fields; so necker paus'd, and his visage was covered with clouds,"
3252,79,"      the king lean'd on his mountains, then lifted his head and look'd on his armies, that shone"
3253,79,"    through heaven, tinging morning with beams of blood; then turning to burgundy, troubled,"
3254,79,"    burgundy, thou wast born a lion! my soul is o'ergrown with distress,"
3255,79,"    for the nobles of france, and dark mists roll round me and blot the writing of god"
3256,79,"    written in my bosom, necker rise! leave the kingdom, thy life is surrounded with snares,"
3257,79,"    we have call'd an assembly, but not to destroy; we have given gifts, not to the weak;"
3258,79,"    i hear rushing of muskets, and bright'ning of swords, and visages redd'ning with war,"
3259,79,"    frowning and looking up from brooding villages and every dark'ning city,"
3260,79,"    ancient wonders frown over the kingdom, and cries of women and babes are heard,"
3261,79,"    and tempests of doubt roll around me, and fierce sorrows, because of the nobles of france,"
3262,79,"    depart! answer not! for the tempest must fall, as in years that are passed away,"
3263,80,"i laid me down upon a bank,"
3264,80,  where love lay sleeping;
3265,80,i heard among the rushes dank
3266,80,"  weeping, weeping,"
3267,80,
3268,80,"then i went to the heath and the wild,"
3269,80,  to the thistles and thorns of the waste;
3270,80,"and they told me how they were beguiled,"
3271,80,"  driven out, and compelled to the chaste,"
3272,80,
3273,80,"i went to the garden of love,"
3274,80,  and saw what i never had seen;
3275,80,"a chapel was built in the midst,"
3276,80,"  where i used to play on the green,"
3277,80,
3278,80,and the gates of this chapel were shut
3279,80,"  and thou shalt not, writ over the door;"
3280,80,so i turned to the garden of love
3281,80,"  that so many sweet flowers bore,"
3282,80,
3283,80,"and i saw it was filled with graves,"
3284,80,  and tombstones where flowers should be;
3285,80,"and priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,"
3286,80,"  and binding with briars my joys and desires,"
3287,81,"i die, i die! the mother said,"
3288,81,"   my children die for lack of bread,"
3289,81,   what more has the merciless tyrant said?
3290,81,"   the monk sat down on the stony bed,"
3291,81,
3292,81,"   the blood red ran from the grey monk's side,"
3293,81,"   his hands and feet were wounded wide,"
3294,81,"   his body bent, his arms and knees"
3295,81,"   like to the roots of ancient trees,"
3296,81,
3297,81,"   his eye was dry; no tear could flow,"
3298,81,"  a hollow groan first spoke his woe,"
3299,81,  he trembled and shudder'd upon the bed;
3300,81,"  at length with a feeble cry he said,"
3301,81,
3302,81,  when god commanded this hand to write
3303,81,"  in the studious hours of deep midnight,"
3304,81,  he told me the writing i wrote should prove
3305,81,"  the bane of all that on earth i lov'd,"
3306,81,
3307,81,"  my brother starv'd between two walls,"
3308,81,  his children's cry my soul appalls;
3309,81,"  i mock'd at the rack and griding chain,"
3310,81,"  my bent body mocks their torturing pain,"
3311,81,
3312,81,"  thy father drew his sword in the north,"
3313,81,  with his thousands strong he marched forth;
3314,81,  thy brother has arm'd himself in steel
3315,81,"  to avenge the wrongs thy children feel,"
3316,81,
3317,81,"  but vain the sword and vain the bow,"
3318,81,"  they never can work war's overthrow,"
3319,81,  the hermit's prayer and the widow's tear
3320,81,"  alone can free the world from fear,"
3321,81,
3322,81,"  for a tear is an intellectual thing,"
3323,81,"  and a sigh is the sword of an angel king,"
3324,81,  and the bitter groan of the martyr's woe
3325,81,"  is an arrow from the almighty's bow,"
3326,81,
3327,81,  the hand of vengeance found the bed
3328,81,  to which the purple tyrant fled;
3329,81,  the iron hand crush'd the tyrant's head
3330,81,"  and became a tyrant in his stead,"
3331,82,pity would be no more
3332,82,if we did not make somebody poor;
3333,82,and mercy no more could be
3334,82,"if all were as happy as we,"
3335,82,
3336,82,"and mutual fear brings peace,"
3337,82,"till the selfish loves increase,"
3338,82,"then cruelty knits a snare,"
3339,82,"and spreads his baits with care,"
3340,82,
3341,82,"he sits down with holy fears,"
3342,82,and waters the grounds with tears;
3343,82,then humility takes its root
3344,82,"underneath his foot,"
3345,82,
3346,82,soon spreads the dismal shade
3347,82,of mystery over his head;
3348,82,and the caterpillar and fly
3349,82,"feed on the mystery,"
3350,82,
3351,82,"and it bears the fruit of deceit,"
3352,82,ruddy and sweet to eat;
3353,82,and the raven his nest has made
3354,82,"in its thickest shade,"
3355,82,
3356,82,the gods of the earth and sea
3357,82,sought thro' nature to find this tree;
3358,82,"but their search was all in vain,"
3359,82,"there grows one in the human brain,"
3360,83,little lamb who made thee
3361,83,dost thou know who made thee
3362,83,"gave thee life & bid thee feed,"
3363,83,by the stream & o'er the mead;
3364,83,"gave thee clothing of delight,"
3365,83,softest clothing wooly bright;
3366,83,"gave thee such a tender voice,"
3367,83,making all the vales rejoice;
3368,83,little lamb who made thee
3369,83,dost thou know who made thee
3370,83,
3371,83,"little lamb i'll tell thee,"
3372,83,little lamb i'll tell thee;
3373,83,"he is called by thy name,"
3374,83,"for he calls himself a lamb,"
3375,83,"he is meek & he is mild,"
3376,83,"he became a little child,"
3377,83,"i a child & thou a lamb,"
3378,83,"we are called by his name,"
3379,83,"little lamb god bless thee,"
3380,83,"little lamb god bless thee,"
3381,84,"awake, awake, my little boy!"
3382,84,thou wast thy mother's only joy;
3383,84,why dost thou weep in thy gentle sleep?
3384,84,"awake! thy father does thee keep,"
3385,84,
3386,84,"o, what land is the land of dreams?"
3387,84,"what are its mountains, and what are its streams?"
3388,84,"o father! i saw my mother there,"
3389,84,"among the lilies by waters fair,"
3390,84,
3391,84,"among the lambs, clothžd in white,"
3392,84,"she walk'd with her thomas in sweet delight,"
3393,84,"i wept for joy, like a dove i mourn;"
3394,84,o! when shall i again return?
3395,84,
3396,84,"dear child, i also by pleasant streams"
3397,84,have wander'd all night in the land of dreams;
3398,84,"but tho' calm and warm the waters wide,"
3399,84,"i could not get to the other side,"
3400,84,
3401,84,"father, o father! what do we here"
3402,84,in this land of unbelief and fear?
3403,84,the land of dreams is better far
3404,84,"above the light of the morning star,"
3405,85,"the modest rose puts forth a thorn,"
3406,85,"the humble sheep a threat'ning horn,"
3407,85,"while the lily white shall in love delight,"
3408,85,"nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright,"
3409,86,"my mother bore me in the southern wild,"
3410,86,"  and i  am black, but oh my soul is white!"
3411,86,"white as an angel is the english child,"
3412,86,"  but i am black, as if bereaved of light,"
3413,86,
3414,86,"my mother taught me underneath a tree,"
3415,86,"  and, sitting down before the heat of day,"
3416,86,"she took me on her lap and kissed me,"
3417,86,"  and, pointed to the east, began to say,"
3418,86,
3419,86,"look on the rising sun, there god does live,"
3420,86,"  and gives his light, and gives his heat away,"
3421,86,and flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
3422,86,"  comfort in morning, joy in the noonday,"
3423,86,
3424,86,"and we are put on earth a little space,"
3425,86,  that we may learn to bear the beams of love
3426,86,and these black bodies and this sunburnt face
3427,86,"  is but a cloud, and like a shady grove,"
3428,86,
3429,86,"for when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,"
3430,86,"  the cloud will vanish, we shall hear his voice,"
3431,86,"saying, 'come out from the grove, my love and care"
3432,86,"  and round my golden tent like lambs rejoice',"
3433,86,
3434,86,"thus did my mother say, and kissed me;"
3435,86,"and thus i say to little english boy,"
3436,86,"when i from black and he from white cloud free,"
3437,86,and round the tent of god like lambs we joy
3438,86,
3439,86,i'll shade him from the heat till he can bear
3440,86,to lean in joy upon our father's knee;
3441,86,"and then i'll stand and stroke his silver hair,"
3442,86,"and be like him, and he will then love me,"
3443,87," the little boy lost in the lonely fen,"
3444,87,"  led by the wandering light,"
3445,87,"began to cry, but god, ever nigh,"
3446,87,"  appeared like his father, in white,"
3447,87,
3448,87,"he kissed the child, and by the hand led,"
3449,87,"  and to his mother brought,"
3450,87,"who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,"
3451,87,"  the little boy weeping sought,"
3452,88," father, father, where are you going?"
3453,88,  oh do not walk so fast!
3454,88,"speak, father, speak to you little boy,"
3455,88,"  or else i shall be lost,"
3456,88,
3457,88,"the night was dark, no father was there,"
3458,88,  the child was wet with dew;
3459,88,"the mire was deep, and the child did weep,"
3460,88,"  and away the vapour flew,"
3461,89,"all the night in woe,"
3462,89,"lyca's parents go,"
3463,89,"over vallies deep,"
3464,89,"while the desarts weep,"
3465,89,
3466,89,"tired and woe-begone,"
3467,89,"hoarse with making moan,"
3468,89,"arm in arm seven days,"
3469,89,"they trac'd the desert ways,"
3470,89,
3471,89,"seven nights they sleep,"
3472,89,"among shadows deep,"
3473,89,and dream they see their child
3474,89,"starvdd in desart wild,"
3475,89,
3476,89,pale thro' pathless ways
3477,89,"the fancied image strays,"
3478,89,"famish'd, weeping, weak"
3479,89,with hollow piteous shriek
3480,89,
3481,89,"rising from unrest,"
3482,89,"the trembling woman prest,"
3483,89,with feet of weary woe;
3484,89,"she could no further go,"
3485,89,
3486,89,"in his arms he bore,"
3487,89,"her arm'd with sorrow sore,"
3488,89,till before their way
3489,89,"a couching lion lay,"
3490,89,
3491,89,"turning back was vain,"
3492,89,"soon his heavy mane,"
3493,89,bore them to the ground;
3494,89,"then he stalk'd around,"
3495,89,
3496,89,"smelling to his prey,"
3497,89,"but their fears allay,"
3498,89,"when he licks their hands,"
3499,89,"and silent by them stands,"
3500,89,
3501,89,they look upon his eyes
3502,89,"fill'd with deep surprise,"
3503,89,"and wondering behold,"
3504,89,"a spirit arm'd in gold,"
3505,89,
3506,89,on his head a crown
3507,89,"on his shoulders down,"
3508,89,"flow'd his golden hair,"
3509,89,"gone was all their care,"
3510,89,
3511,89,"follow me he said,"
3512,89,weep not for the maid;
3513,89,"in my palace deep,"
3514,89,"lyca lies asleep,"
3515,89,
3516,89,"then they followed,"
3517,89,where the vision led;
3518,89,"and saw their sleeping child,"
3519,89,"among tygers wild,"
3520,89,
3521,89,to this day they dwell
3522,89,in a lonely dell
3523,89,"nor fear the wolvish howl,"
3524,89,"nor the lion's growl,"
3525,90,"children of the future age,"
3526,90,"reading this indignant page,"
3527,90,know that in a former time
3528,90,"love, sweet love, was thought a crime,"
3529,90,
3530,90,"in the age of gold,"
3531,90,"free from winter's cold,"
3532,90,"youth and maiden bright,"
3533,90,"to the holy light,"
3534,90,"naked in the sunny beams delight,"
3535,90,
3536,90,"once a youthful pair,"
3537,90,"filled with softest care,"
3538,90,met in garden bright
3539,90,where the holy light
3540,90,"had just removed the curtains of the night,"
3541,90,
3542,90,"then, in rising day,"
3543,90,on the grass they play;
3544,90,"parents were afar,"
3545,90,"strangers came not near,"
3546,90,"and the maiden soon forgot her fear,"
3547,90,
3548,90,"tired with kisses sweet,"
3549,90,they agree to meet
3550,90,when the silent sleep
3551,90,"waves o'er heaven's deep,"
3552,90,"and the weary tired wanderers weep,"
3553,90,
3554,90,to her father white
3555,90,came the maiden bright;
3556,90,"but his loving look,"
3557,90,like the holy book
3558,90,"all her tender limbs with terror shook,"
3559,90,
3560,90,"ona, pale and weak,"
3561,90,to thy father speak!
3562,90,oh the trembling fear!
3563,90,oh the dismal care
3564,90,that shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!
3565,91,"dear mother, dear mother, the church is cold,"
3566,91,    but the ale-house is healthy and pleasant and warm;
3567,91,"    besides i can tell where i am used well,"
3568,91,"    such usage in heaven will never do well,"
3569,91,"      but if at the church they would give us some ale,"
3570,91,"    and a pleasant fire our souls to regale,"
3571,91,"    we'd sing and we'd pray all the live-long day,"
3572,91,"    nor ever once wish from the church to stray,"
3573,91,"      then the parson might preach, and drink, and sing,"
3574,91,   and we'd be as happy as birds in the spring;
3575,91,"   and modest dame lurch, who is always at church,"
3576,91,"   would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch,"
3577,91,"     and god, like a father rejoicing to see"
3578,91,"   his children as pleasant and happy as he,"
3579,91,"   would have no more quarrel with the devil or the barrel,"
3580,91,"   but kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel,"
3581,92,"in seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy,"
3582,92,"    drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead,"
3583,92,"    the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,"
3584,92,"    prudence is a rich, ugly old maid courted by incapacity,"
3585,92,"    he who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence,"
3586,92,"    the cut worm forgives the plow,"
3587,92,"    dip him in the river who loves water,"
3588,92,"    a fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees,"
3589,92,"    he whose face gives no light, shall never become a star,"
3590,92,"   eternity is in love with the productions of time,"
3591,92,"   the busy bee has no time for sorrow,"
3592,92,"   the hours of folly are measur'd by the clock; but of wisdom, no clock can measure,"
3593,92,"   all wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap,"
3594,92,"   bring out number, weight and measure in a year of dearth,"
3595,92,"   no bird soars too high, if he soars with his own wings,"
3596,92,"   a dead body revenges not injuries,"
3597,92,"   the most sublime act is to set another before you,"
3598,92,"   if the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise,"
3599,92,"   folly is the cloak of knavery,"
3600,92,"   shame is pride's cloke,"
3601,92,"   prisons are built with stones of law, brothels with bricks of religion,"
3602,92,"   the pride of the peacock is the glory of god,"
3603,92,"   the lust of the goat is the bounty of god,"
3604,92,"   the wrath of the lion is the wisdom of god,"
3605,92,"   the nakedness of woman is the work of god,"
3606,92,"   excess of sorrow laughs, excess of joy weeps,"
3607,92,"   the roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of"
3608,92,"eternity, too great for the eye of man,"
3609,92,"   the fox condemns the trap, not himself,"
3610,92,"   joys impregnate, sorrows bring forth,"
3611,92,"   let man wear the fell of the lion, woman the fleece of the sheep,"
3612,92,"   the bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship,"
3613,92,"   the selfish, smiling fool, and the sullen, frowning fool shall be both thought wise, that they may be a rod,"
3614,92,"   what is now proved was once only imagin'd,"
3615,92,"   the rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbit watch the roots; the lion, the tyger, the horse, the elephant watch the fruits,"
3616,92,"   the cistern contains, the fountain overflows,"
3617,92,"   one thought fills immensity,"
3618,92,"   always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you,"
3619,92,"   every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth,"
3620,92,"   the eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow,"
3621,92,"   the fox provides for himself, but god provides for the lion,"
3622,92,"   think in the morning, act in the noon, eat in the evening, sleep in the night,"
3623,92,"   he who has suffer'd you to impose on him, knows you,"
3624,92,"   as the plow follows words, so god rewards prayers,"
3625,92,"   the tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction,"
3626,92,"   expect poison from the standing water,"
3627,92,"   you never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough,"
3628,92,   listen to the fool's reproach! it is a kingly title!
3629,92,"   the eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard of earth,"
3630,92,"   the weak in courage is strong in cunning,"
3631,92,"   the apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow; nor the lion, the horse, how he shall take his prey,"
3632,92,"   the thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest,"
3633,92,"   if others had not been foolish, we should be so,"
3634,92,"   the soul of sweet delight can never be defil'd,"
3635,92,"   when thou seest an eagle, thou seest a portion of genius; lift up thy head!"
3636,92,"   as the caterpiller chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys,"
3637,92,"   to create a little flower is the labour of ages,"
3638,92,"   damn braces, bless relaxes,"
3639,92,"   the best wine is the oldest, the best water the newest,"
3640,92,   prayers plow not! praises reap not!
3641,92,   joys laugh not! sorrows weep not!
3642,92,"   the head sublime, the heart pathos, the genitals beauty, the hands and feet proportion,"
3643,92,"   as the air to a bird or the sea to a fish, so is contempt to the contemptible,"
3644,92,"   the crow wish'd every thing was black, the owl that every thing was white,"
3645,92,"   exuberance is beauty,"
3646,92,"   if the lion was advised by the fox, he would be cunning,"
3647,92,"   improvement makes strait roads; but the crooked roads without improvement are roads of genius,"
3648,92,"   sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires,"
3649,92,"   where man is not, nature is barren,"
3650,92,"   truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ'd,"
3651,92,"   enough! or too much,"
3652,93,and did those feet in ancient time
3653,93,walk upon england's mountains green?
3654,93,and was the holy lamb of god
3655,93,on england's pleasant pastures seen?
3656,93,
3657,93,and did the countenance divine
3658,93,shine forth upon our clouded hills?
3659,93,and was jerusalem builded here
3660,93,among these dark satanic mills?
3661,93,
3662,93,bring me my bow of burning gold!
3663,93,bring me my arrows of desire!
3664,93,"bring me my spear!  o clouds, unfold!"
3665,93,bring me my charriot of fire!
3666,93,
3667,93,"i will not cease from mental fight,"
3668,93,nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
3669,93,till we have built jerusalem
3670,93,"in england's green and pleasant land,"
3671,94,what is it men in women do require?
3672,94,"the lineaments of gratified desire,"
3673,94,what is it women do in men require?
3674,94,the lineaments of gratified desire
3675,95,"i love to rise in a summer morn,"
3676,95,when the birds sing on every tree;
3677,95,"the distant huntsman winds his horn,"
3678,95,"and the sky-lark sings with me,"
3679,95,"o! what sweet company,"
3680,95,
3681,95,"but to go to school in a summer morn,"
3682,95,o! it drives all joy away;
3683,95,"under a cruel eye outworn,"
3684,95,"the little ones spend the day,"
3685,95,"in sighing and dismay,"
3686,95,
3687,95,"ah! then at times i drooping sit,"
3688,95,"and spend many an anxious hour,"
3689,95,"nor in my book can i take delight,"
3690,95,"nor sit in learnings bower,"
3691,95,"worn thro' with the dreary shower,"
3692,95,
3693,95,"how can the bird that is born for joy,"
3694,95,"sit in a cage and sing,"
3695,95,"how can a child when fears annoy,"
3696,95,"but droop his tender wing,"
3697,95,"and forget his youthful spring,"
3698,95,
3699,95,"o! father & mother, if buds are nip'd,"
3700,95,"and blossoms blown away,"
3701,95,and if the tender plants are strip'd
3702,95,"of their joy in the springing day,"
3703,95,"by sorrow and care's dismay,"
3704,95,
3705,95,"how shall the summer arise in joy,"
3706,95,"or the summer fruits appear,"
3707,95,or how shall we gather what griefs destroy
3708,95,"or bless the mellowing year,"
3709,95,"when the blasts of winter appear,"
3710,96,how sweet is the shepherd's sweet lot!
3711,96,from the morn to the evening he strays;
3712,96,"he shall follow his sheep all the day,"
3713,96,"and his tongue shall be filled with praise,"
3714,96,
3715,96,"for he hears the lambs' innocent call,"
3716,96,and he hears the ewes' tender reply;
3717,96,"he is watchful while they are in peace,"
3718,96,"for they know when their shepherd is nigh,"
3719,97,"o rose, thou art sick!"
3720,97,the invisible worm
3721,97,"that flies in the night,"
3722,97,"in the howling storm,"
3723,97,has found out thy bed
3724,97,"of crimson joy,"
3725,97,and his dark secret love
3726,97,"does thy life destroy,"
3727,98,"the sky is an immortal tent built by the sons of los,"
3728,98,   and every space that a man views around his dwelling-place
3729,98,   standing on his own roof or in his garden on a mount
3730,98,"   of twenty-five cubits in height, such space is his universe,"
3731,98,"   and on its verge the sun rises and sets, the clouds bow"
3732,98,"   to meet the flat earth and the sea in such an order'd space,"
3733,98,"   the starry heavens reach no further, but here bend and set"
3734,98,"   on all sides, and the two poles turn on their valves of gold,"
3735,98,"   and if he moves his dwelling-place, his heavens also move"
3736,98,"  where'er he goes, and all his neighbourhood bewail his loss,"
3737,98,"  such are the spaces called earth and such its dimension,"
3738,98,  as to that false appearance which appears to the reasoner
3739,98,"  as of a globe rolling through voidness, it is a delusion of ulro,"
3740,98,"  the microscope knows not of this nor the telescope, they alter"
3741,98,"  the ratio of the spectator's organs, but leave objects untouch'd,"
3742,98,  for every space larger than a red globule of man's blood
3743,98,"  is visionary, and is created by the hammer of los;"
3744,98,  and every space smaller than a globule of man's blood opens
3745,98,"  into eternity of which this vegetable earth is but a shadow,"
3746,98,  the red globule is the unwearied sun by los created
3747,98,"  to measure time and space to mortal men every morning,"
3748,99,africa
3749,99,
3750,99,"       i will sing you a song of los, the eternal prophet,"
3751,99,"       he sung it to four harps at the tables of eternity,"
3752,99,"       in heart-formed africa,"
3753,99,      urizen faded! ariston shudderd!
3754,99,     and thus the song began
3755,99,
3756,99,"       adam stood in the garden of eden,"
3757,99,     and noah on the mountains of ararat;
3758,99,     they saw urizen give his laws to the nations
3759,99,"      by the hands of the children of los,"
3760,99,
3761,99,       adam shudderd! noah faded! black grew the sunny african
3762,99,"       when rintrah gave abstract philosophy to brama in the east,"
3763,99,       night spoke to the cloud!
3764,99,"       lo these human form'd spirits in smiling hipocrisy, war"
3765,99,       against one another; so let them war on; slaves to the eternal elements
3766,99,"       noah shrunk, beneath the waters;"
3767,99,       abram fled in fires from chaldea;
3768,99,"       moses beheld upon mount sinai forms of dark delusion,"
3769,99,
3770,99,"       to trismegistus, palamabron gave an abstract law,"
3771,99,"       to pythagoras socrates & plato,"
3772,99,
3773,99,"       times rolled on o'er all the sons of har, time after time"
3774,99,"      orc on mount atlas howld, chain'd down with the chain of jealousy"
3775,99,      then oothoon hoverd over judah & jerusalem
3776,99,       and jesus heard her voice a man of sorrows he receivd
3777,99,"       a gospel from wretched theotormon,"
3778,99,
3779,99,"       the human race began to wither, for the healthy built"
3780,99,"       secluded places, fearing the joys of love"
3781,99,"    and the disease'd only propagated,"
3782,99,"       so antamon call'd up leutha from her valleys of delight,"
3783,99,"      and to mahomet a loose bible gave,"
3784,99,"       but in the north, to odin, sotha gave a code of war,"
3785,99,"       because of diralada thinking to reclaim his joy,"
3786,99,
3787,99,"       these were the churches, hospitals, castles, palaces,"
3788,99,       like nets & gins & traps to catch the joys of eternity
3789,99,      and all the rest a desart;
3790,99,"       till like a dream eternity was obliterated & erased,"
3791,99,
3792,99,"       since that dread day when har and heva fled,"
3793,99,      because their brethren & sisters liv'd in war & lust;
3794,99,       and as they fled they shrunk
3795,99,"      into two narrow doleful forms,"
3796,99,       creeping in reptile flesh upon
3797,99,"     the bosom of the ground,"
3798,99,     and all the vast of nature shrunk
3799,99,"      before their shrunken eyes,"
3800,99,
3801,99,      thus the terrible race of los & enitharmon gave
3802,99,      laws & religions to the sons of har binding them more
3803,99,"       and more to earth, closing and restraining,"
3804,99,      till a philosophy of five senses was complete
3805,99,     urizen wept & gave it into the hands of newton & locke
3806,99,
3807,99,"      clouds roll heavy upon the alps round rousseau & voltaire,"
3808,99,      and on the mountains of lebanon round the deceased gods
3809,99,     of asia; & on the deserts of africa round the fallen angels
3810,99,      the guardian prince of albion burns in his nightly tent
3811,99,
3812,99,      asia
3813,99,
3814,99,   the kings of asia heard
3815,99,     the howl rise up from europe!
3816,99,   and each ran out from his web;
3817,99,      from his ancient woven den;
3818,99,      for the darkness of asia was startled
3819,99,"     at the thick-flaming, thought-creating fires of orc,"
3820,99,
3821,99,      and the kings of asia stood
3822,99,"      and cried in bitterness of soul,"
3823,99,
3824,99,      shall not the king call for famine from the heath?
3825,99,"      nor the priest, for pestilence from the fen?"
3826,99,    to restrain! to dismay! to thin!
3827,99,      the inhabitants of mountain and plain;
3828,99,"       in the day, of full-feeding prosperity;"
3829,99,"       and the night of delicious songs,"
3830,99,
3831,99,      shall not the councellor throw his curb
3832,99,      of poverty on the laborious?
3833,99,   to fix the price of labour;
3834,99,"    to invent allegoric riches,"
3835,99,
3836,99,     and the privy admonishers of men
3837,99,     call for fires in the city
3838,99,"      for heaps of smoking ruins,"
3839,99,      in the night of prosperity & wantonness
3840,99,
3841,99,"      to turn man from his path,"
3842,99,"       to restrain the child from the womb,"
3843,99,
3844,99,"    to cut off the bread from the city,"
3845,99,"      that the remnant may learn to obey,"
3846,99,      that the pride of the heart may fail;
3847,99,"      that the lust of the eyes may be quench'd,"
3848,99,      that the delicate ear in its infancy
3849,99,
3850,99,       may be dull'd; and the nostrils clos'd up;
3851,99,       to teach mortal worms the path
3852,99,"     that leads from the gates of the grave,"
3853,99,
3854,99,     urizen heard them cry!
3855,99,    and his shudd'ring waving wings
3856,99,      went enormous above the red flames
3857,99,     drawing clouds of despair thro' the heavens
3858,99,"      of europe as he went,"
3859,99,    and his books of brass iron & gold
3860,99,"      melted over the land as he flew,"
3861,99,
3862,99,"      heavy-waving, howling, weeping,"
3863,99,
3864,99,"   and he stood over judea,"
3865,99,"  and stay'd in his ancient place,"
3866,99,    and stretch'd his clouds over jerusalem;
3867,99,
3868,99,"      for adam, a mouldering skeleton"
3869,99,     lay bleach'd on the garden of eden;
3870,99,     and noah as white as snow
3871,99,"    on the mountains of ararat,"
3872,99,
3873,99,       then the thunders of urizen bellow'd aloud
3874,99,"       from his woven darkness above,"
3875,99,
3876,99,       orc raging in european darkness
3877,99,       arose like a pillar of fire above the alps
3878,99,      like a serpent of fiery flame!
3879,99,      the sullen earth
3880,99,       shrunk!
3881,99,
3882,99,    forth from the dead dust rattling bones to bones
3883,99,"    join, shaking convuls'd the shivring clay breathes"
3884,99,"    and all flesh naked stands, fathers and friends;"
3885,99,"      mothers & infants; kings & warriors,"
3886,99,
3887,99,"    the grave shrieks with delight, & shakes"
3888,99,"       her hollow womb, & clasps the solid stem,"
3889,99,"    her bosom swells with wild desire,"
3890,99,"      and milk & blood & glandous wine,"
3891,100,i heard an angel singing
3892,100,"when the day was springing,"
3893,100,"mercy, pity, and peace,"
3894,100,"are the world's release,"
3895,100,
3896,100,so he sang all day
3897,100,"over the new-mown hay,"
3898,100,"till the sun went down,"
3899,100,"and the haycocks looked brown,"
3900,100,
3901,100,i heard a devil curse
3902,100,"over the heath and the furse,"
3903,100,mercy vould be no more
3904,100,"if there were nobody poor,"
3905,100,and pity no more could be
3906,100,"if all were happy as ye,"
3907,100,"and mutual fear brings peace,"
3908,100,misery's increase
3909,100,"are mercy, pity, and peace,"
3910,100,
3911,100,"at his curse the sun went down,"
3912,100,"and the heavens gave a frown,"
3913,101,tyger! tyger! burning bright
3914,101,in the forest of the night
3915,101,what immortal hand or eye
3916,101,could frame thy fearful symmetry?
3917,101,
3918,101,in what distant deeps or skies
3919,101,burnt the fire of thine eyes?
3920,101,on what wings dare he aspire?
3921,101,what the hand dare seize the fire?
3922,101,
3923,101,"and what shoulder, and what art,"
3924,101,could twist the sinews of thy heart?
3925,101,"and when thy heart began to beat,"
3926,101,what dread hand? and what dread feet?
3927,101,
3928,101,what the hammer? what the chain?
3929,101,in what furnace was thy brain?
3930,101,what the anvil? what dread grasp
3931,101,dare its deadly terrors clasp?
3932,101,
3933,101,"when the stars threw down their spears,"
3934,101,"and watered heaven with their tears,"
3935,101,did he smile his work to see?
3936,101,did he who made the lamb make thee?
3937,101,
3938,101,tyger! tyger! burning bright
3939,101,"in the forests of the night,"
3940,101,what immortal hand or eye
3941,101,dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
3942,102,"youth of delight, come hither,"
3943,102,"and see the opening morn,"
3944,102,"image of truth new born,"
3945,102,"doubt is fled, & clouds of reason,"
3946,102,"dark disputes & artful teazing,"
3947,102,"folly is an endless maze,"
3948,102,"tangled roots perplex her ways,"
3949,102,how many have fallen there!
3950,102,"they stumble all night over bones of the dead,"
3951,102,"and feel they know not what but care,"
3952,102,"and wish to lead others, when they should be led,"
3953,103,"as i wandered the forest,"
3954,103,"the green leaves among,"
3955,103,i heard a wild flower
3956,103,"singing a song,"
3957,103,
3958,103,i slept in the earth
3959,103,"in the silent night,"
3960,103,i murmured my fears
3961,103,"and i felt delight,"
3962,103,
3963,103,in the morning i went
3964,103,"as rosy as morn,"
3965,103,to seek for new joy;
3966,103,"but oh! met with scorn,"
3967,104,"a robin redbreast in a cage,"
3968,104,"puts all heaven in a rage,"
3969,104,
3970,104,a skylark wounded on the wing
3971,104,"doth make a cherub cease to sing,"
3972,104,
3973,104,he who shall hurt the little wren
3974,104,"shall never be beloved by men,"
3975,105,"o autumn, laden with fruit, and stain'd"
3976,105,"with the blood of the grape, pass not, but sit"
3977,105,"beneath my shady roof; there thou may'st rest,"
3978,105,"and tune thy jolly voice to my fresh pipe,"
3979,105,and all the daughters of the year shall dance!
3980,105,"sing now the lusty song of fruits and flowers,"
3981,105,
3982,105,the narrow bud opens her beauties to
3983,105,"the sun, and love runs in her thrilling veins;"
3984,105,"blossoms hang round the brows of morning, and"
3985,105,"flourish down the bright cheek of modest eve,"
3986,105,"till clust'ring summer breaks forth into singing,"
3987,105,"and feather'd clouds strew flowers round her head,"
3988,105,
3989,105,the spirits of the air live in the smells
3990,105,"of fruit; and joy, with pinions light, roves round"
3991,105,"the gardens, or sits singing in the trees,"
3992,105,"thus sang the jolly autumn as he sat,"
3993,105,"then rose, girded himself, and o'er the bleak"
3994,105,"hills fled from our sight; but left his golden load,"
3995,106,"o holy virgin! clad in purest white,"
3996,106,"unlock heav'n's golden gates, and issue forth;"
3997,106,awake the dawn that sleeps in heaven; let light
3998,106,"rise from the chambers of the east, and bring"
3999,106,"the honey'd dew that cometh on waking day,"
4000,106,"o radiant morning, salute the sun"
4001,106,"rous'd like a huntsman to the chase, and with"
4002,106,"thy buskin'd feet appear upon our hills,"
4003,107,why art thou silent & invisible  
4004,107,father of jealousy
4005,107,why dost thou hide thyself in clouds  
4006,107,from every searching eye
4007,107,
4008,107,why darkness & obscurity
4009,107,in all thy words & laws  
4010,107,that none dare eat the fruit but from  
4011,107,the wily serpents jaws  
4012,107,or is it because secrecy
4013,107,gains females loud applause
4014,108,"o thou with dewy locks, who lookest down"
4015,108,"thro' the clear windows of the morning, turn"
4016,108,"thine angel eyes upon our western isle,"

4018,108,
4019,108,"the hills tell each other, and the listening"
4020,108,valleys hear; all our longing eyes are turned
4021,108,"up to thy bright pavilions, issue forth,"
4022,108,"and let thy holy feet visit our clime,"
4023,108,
4024,108,"come o'er the eastern hills, and let our winds"
4025,108,kiss thy perfumed garments; let us taste

4028,108,
4029,108,o deck her forth with thy fair fingers; pour
4030,108,thy soft kisses on her bosom; and put

4034,109,"thy strength, curb thy fierce steeds, allay the heat"
4035,109,"that flames from their large nostrils! thou, o summer,"
4036,109,"oft pitched'st here thy goldent tent, and oft"
4037,109,"beneath our oaks hast slept, while we beheld"
4038,109,"with joy thy ruddy limbs and flourishing hair,"
4039,109,
4040,109,beneath our thickest shades we oft have heard
4041,109,"thy voice, when noon upon his fervid car"

4043,109,"sit down, and in our mossy valleys, on"
4044,109,"some bank beside a river clear, throw thy"
4045,109,"silk draperies off, and rush into the stream,"
4046,109,"our valleys love the summer in his pride,"
4047,109,
4048,109,"our bards are fam'd who strike the silver wire,"

4059,110,tho thou art worship'd by the names divine        
4060,110,of jesus & jehovah thou art still
4061,110,the son of morn in weary nights decline
4062,110,the lost travellers dream under the hill
4063,111,"thou fair-haired angel of the evening,"
4064,111,"now, whilst the sun rests on the mountains, light"
4065,111,thy bright torch of love; thy radiant crown
4066,111,"put on, and smile upon our evening bed!"
4067,111,"smile on our loves, and while thou drawest the"
4068,111,"blue curtains of the sky, scatter thy silver dew"
4069,111,on every flower that shuts its sweet eyes
4070,111,"in timely sleep, let thy west wing sleep on"
4071,111,"the lake; speak silence with thy glimmering eyes,"
4072,111,"and wash the dusk with silver, soon, full soon,"
4073,111,"dost thou withdraw; then the wolf rages wide,"
4074,111,"and the lion glares through the dun forest,"
4075,111,the fleeces of our flocks are covered with

4094,113,"my first vision of light,  "
4095,113,"on the yellow sands sitting,  "

4097,113,his glorious beams          
4098,113,"from heaven’s high streams,  "
4099,113,"over sea, over land,  "

4108,113,the jewels of light  
4109,113,"distinct shone and clear,  "
4110,113,amaz’d and in fear  
4111,113,"i each particle gazèd,  "
4112,113,"astonish’d, amazèd;        "
4113,113,for each was a man  
4114,113,"human-form’d, swift i ran,  "
4115,113,"for they beckon’d to me,  "
4116,113,"remote by the sea,  "
4117,113,"saying, ‘each grain of sand,        "
4118,113,"every stone on the land,  "
4119,113,"each rock and each hill,  "
4120,113,"each fountain and rill,  "
4121,113,"each herb and each tree,  "
4122,113,"mountain, hill, earth, and sea,        "
4123,113,"cloud, meteor, and star,  "
4124,113,"are men seen afar,’  "
4125,113,i stood in the streams  
4126,113,"of heaven’s bright beams,  "
4127,113,and saw felpham sweet        
4128,113,"beneath my bright feet,  "
4129,113,in soft female charms;  
4130,113,and in her fair arms  
4131,113,"my shadow i knew,  "
4132,113,"and my wife’s shadow too,        "
4133,113,"and my sister, and friend,  "
4134,113,we like infants descend  
4135,113,"in our shadows on earth,  "
4136,113,"like a weak mortal birth,  "
4137,113,"my eyes, more and more,        "
4138,113,"like a sea without shore,  "
4139,113,"continue expanding,  "
4140,113,the heavens commanding;  
4141,113,"till the jewels of light,  "
4142,113,"heavenly men beaming bright,        "
4143,113,"appear’d as one man,  "
4144,113,who complacent began  
4145,113,my limbs to enfold  
4146,113,in his beams of bright gold;  
4147,113,like dross purg’d away        
4148,113,"all my mire and my clay,  "
4149,113,"soft consum’d in delight,  "
4150,113,in his bosom sun-bright  
4151,113,"i remain’d, soft he smil’d,  "
4152,113,"and i heard his voice mild,        "
4153,113,"saying, ‘this is my fold,  "
4154,113,"o thou ram horn’d with gold,  "
4155,113,who awakest from sleep  
4156,113,"on the sides of the deep,  "
4157,113,on the mountains around        
4158,113,the roarings resound  
4159,113,"of the lion and wolf,  "
4160,113,"the loud sea, and deep gulf,  "
4161,113,"these are guards of my fold,  "
4162,113,o thou ram horn’d with gold!’        
4163,113,and the voice faded mild;  
4164,113,i remain’d as a child;  
4165,113,all i ever had known  
4166,113,"before me bright shone,  "
4167,113,i saw you and your wife        
4168,113,"by the fountains of life,  "
4169,113,such the vision to me  
4170,113,"appear’d on the sea,"
4171,114,whate'er is born of mortal birth
4172,114,must be consumed with the earth
4173,114,"to rise from generation free,"
4174,114,then what have i to do with thee?
4175,114,
4176,114,"the sexes sprung from shame & pride,"
4177,114,"blow'd in the morn, in evening died;"
4178,114,but mercy chang'd death into sleep;
4179,114,"the sexes rose to work & weep,"
4180,114,
4181,114,"thou, mother of my mortal part,"
4182,114,"with cruelty didst mould my heart,"
4183,114,and with false self-deceiving tears
4184,114,"didst bind my nostrils, eyes, & ears,"
4185,114,
4186,114,"didst close my tongue in senseless clay,"
4187,114,"and me to mortal life betray,"
4188,114,"the death of jesus set me free,"
4189,114,then what have i to do with thee?
4190,115,"o winter! bar thine adamantine doors,"
4191,115,the north is thine; there hast thou built thy dark
4192,115,"deep-founded habitation, shake not thy roofs,"
4193,115,"nor bend thy pillars with thine iron car,'"
4194,115,"he hears me not, but o'er the yawning deep"
4195,115,"rides heavy; his storms are unchain'd, sheathèd"
4196,115,"in ribbèd steel; i dare not lift mine eyes,"
4197,115,"for he hath rear'd his sceptre o'er the world,"
4198,115,
4199,115,"lo! now the direful monster, whose 1000 skin clings"
4200,115,"to his strong bones, strides o'er the groaning rocks,"
4201,115,"he withers all in silence, and in his hand"
4202,115,"unclothes the earth, and freezes up frail life,"
4203,115,
4204,115,"he takes his seat upon the cliffs,--the mariner"
4205,115,"cries in vain, poor little wretch, that deal'st"
4206,115,"with storms!--till heaven smiles, and the monster"
4207,115,"is driv'n yelling to his caves beneath mount hecla,"
4208,116,"when klopstock england defied,"
4209,116,uprose william blake in his pride;
4210,116,for old nobodaddy aloft
4211,116,", , , and belch'd and cough'd;"
4212,116,"then swore a great oath that made heaven quake,"
4213,116,"and call'd aloud to english blake,"
4214,116,"blake was giving his body ease,"
4215,116,"at lambeth beneath the poplar trees,"
4216,116,from his seat then started he
4217,116,"and turn'd him round three times three,"
4218,116,"the moon at that sight blush'd scarlet red,"
4219,116,"the stars threw down their cups and fled,"
4220,116,"and all the devils that were in hell,"
4221,116,
4222,116,"answerèd with a ninefold yell,"
4223,116,"klopstock felt the intripled turn,"
4224,116,"and all his bowels began to churn,"
4225,116,"and his bowels turn'd round three times three,"
4226,116,"and lock'd in his soul with a ninefold key; , , ,"
4227,116,then again old nobodaddy swore
4228,116,"he ne'er had seen such a thing before,"
4229,116,"since noah was shut in the ark,"
4230,116,"since eve first chose her hellfire spark,"
4231,116,"since 'twas the fashion to go naked,"
4232,116,"since the old anything was created , , ,"
4233,117,why should i care for the men of thames  
4234,117,or the cheating waves of charter'd streams  
4235,117,or shrink at the little blasts of fear  
4236,117,that the hireling blows into my ear  
4237,117,
4238,117,tho born on the cheating banks of thames
4239,117,tho his waters bathed my infant limbs  
4240,117,the ohio shall wash his stains from me
4241,117,"i was born a slave but i go to be free,"
4242,118,"why was cupid a boy,"
4243,118,and why a boy was he?
4244,118,"he should have been a girl,"
4245,118,"for aught that i can see,"
4246,118,
4247,118,"for he shoots with his bow,"
4248,118,"and the girl shoots with her eye,"
4249,118,"and they both are merry and glad,"
4250,118,"and laugh when we do cry,"
4251,118,
4252,118,and to make cupid a boy
4253,118,was the cupid girl's mocking plan;
4254,118,for a boy can't interpret the thing
4255,118,"till he is become a man,"
4256,118,
4257,118,"and then he's so pierc'd with cares,"
4258,118,"and wounded with arrowy smarts,"
4259,118,that the whole business of his life
4260,118,"is to pick out the heads of the darts,"
4261,118,
4262,118,'twas the greeks' love of war
4263,118,"turn'd love into a boy,"
4264,118,and woman into a statue of stone--
4265,118,"and away fled every joy,"
4266,119,"you don't believe -- i won't attempt to make ye,"
4267,119,"you are asleep -- i won't attempt to wake ye,"
4268,119,sleep on! sleep on! while in your pleasant dreams
4269,119,"of reason you may drink of life's clear streams,"
4270,119,"reason and newton, they are quite two things;"
4271,119,"for so the swallow and the sparrow sings,"
4272,119,
4273,119,"reason says `miracle', newton says `doubt,'"
4274,119,"aye! that's the way to make all nature out,"
4275,119,"`doubt, doubt, and don't believe without experiment',"
4276,119,"that is the very thing that jesus meant,"
4277,119,when he said `only believe! believe and try!
4278,119,"try, try, and never mind the reason why!'"
