269,5,"went dressed in vegetation,"
270,5,in flights which opened a tunnel
271,5,through the wind would pass
272,5,to where birds were breaking open
273,5,the dense blue air -

276,5,"when i returned from so many journeys,"
277,5,i stayed suspended and green

279,5,"i saw how wings worked,"
280,5,how perfumes are transmitted
281,5,"by feathery telegraph,"
282,5,"and from above i saw the path,"
283,5,"the springs and the roof tiles,"
284,5,"the fishermen at their trades,"
285,5,the trousers of the foam;
286,5,"i saw it all from my green sky,"

288,5,"than the swallows in their courses,"
289,5,"the tiny, shining water"
290,5,of the small bird on fire
291,5,"which dances out of the pollen,"
292,6,"brown and agile child, the sun which forms the fruit"
293,6,and ripens the grain and twists the seaweed
294,6,has made your happy body and your luminous eyes
295,6,"and given your mouth the smile of water,"
296,6,
297,6,a black and anguished sun is entangled in the twigs
298,6,"of your black mane when you hold out your arms,"
299,6,you play in the sun as in a tidal river
300,6,"and it leaves two dark pools in your eyes,"
301,6,
302,6,"brown and agile child, nothing draws me to you,"
303,6,"everything pulls away from me here in the noon,"
304,6,"you are the delirious youth of bee,"
305,6,"the drunkedness of the wave, the power of the heat,"
306,6,
307,6,my somber heart seeks you always
308,6,"i love your happy body, your rich, soft voice,"
309,6,"dusky butterfly, sweet and sure"
310,6,"like the wheat field, the sun, the poppy, and the water,"
311,7,"how neatly a cat sleeps,"
312,7,"sleeps with its paws and its posture,"
313,7,"sleeps with its wicked claws,"
314,7,"and with its unfeeling blood,"
315,7,sleeps with all the rings--
316,7,a series of burnt circles--
317,7,which have formed the odd geology
318,7,"of its sand-colored tail,"
319,7,
320,7,"i should like to sleep like a cat,"
321,7,"with all the fur of time,"
322,7,"with a tongue rough as flint,"
323,7,with the dry sex of fire;
324,7,"and after speaking to no one,"
325,7,"stretch myself over the world,"
326,7,"over roofs and landscapes,"
327,7,with a passionate desire
328,7,"to hunt the rats in my dreams,"
329,7,
330,7,i have seen how the cat asleep
331,7,"would undulate, how the night"
332,7,flowed through it like dark water;
333,7,"and at times, it was going to fall"
334,7,or possibly plunge into
335,7,"the bare deserted snowdrifts,"
336,7,sometimes it grew so much in sleep
337,7,"like a tiger's great-grandfather,"
338,7,and would leap in the darkness over
339,7,"rooftops, clouds and volcanoes,"
340,7,

342,7,with episcopal ceremony
343,7,"and your stone-carved moustache,"
344,7,take care of all our dreams;
345,7,control the obscurity
346,7,of our slumbering prowess
347,7,with your relentless heart
348,7,"and the great ruff of your tail,"
349,7,
350,7,translated by alastair reid
351,8,"we have lost even this twilight,"
352,8,no one saw us this evening hand in hand
353,8,"while the blue night dropped on the world,"
354,8,
355,8,i have seen from my window
356,8,"the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops,"
357,8,
358,8,sometimes a piece of sun
359,8,"burned like a coin in my hand,"
360,8,
361,8,i remembered you with my soul clenched
362,8,"in that sadness of mine that you know,"
363,8,
364,8,where were you then?
365,8,who else was there?
366,8,saying what?
367,8,why will the whole of love come on me suddenly
368,8,when i am sad and feel you are far away?
369,8,
370,8,the book fell that always closed at twilight
371,8,"and my blue sweater rolled like a hurt dog at my feet,"
372,8,
373,8,"always, always you recede through the evenings"
374,8,"toward the twilight erasing statues,"
375,9,drunk as drunk on turpentine
376,9,"from your open kisses,"
377,9,your wet body wedged
378,9,between my wet body and the strake
379,9,"of our boat that is made of flowers,"
380,9,"feasted, we guide it - our fingers"
381,9,like tallows adorned with yellow metal -
382,9,"over the sky's hot rim,"
383,9,"the day's last breath in our sails,"
384,9,
385,9,pinned by the sun between solstice
386,9,"and equinox, drowsy and tangled together"
387,9,we drifted for months and woke
388,9,"with the bitter taste of land on our lips,"
389,9,"eyelids all sticky, and we longed for lime"
390,9,and the sound of a rope
391,9,"lowering a bucket down its well, then,"
392,9,"we came by night to the fortunate isles,"
393,9,and lay like fish
394,9,"under the net of our kisses,"
395,9,
396,9,      poema 9
397,9,
398,9,"ebrio de trementina y largos besos,"
399,9,"estival, el velero de las rosas dirijo,"
400,9,"torcido hacia la muerte del delgado día,"
401,9,"cimentado en el sólido frenesí marino,"
402,9,
403,9,pálido y amarrado a mi agua devorante
404,9,"cruzo en el agrio olor del clima descubierto,"
405,9,"aún vestido de gris y sonidos amargos,"
406,9,"y una cimera triste de abandonada espuma,"
407,9,
408,9,"voy, duro de pasiones, montado en mi ola única,"
409,9,"lunar, solar, ardiente y frío, repentino,"
410,9,dormido en la garganta de las afortunadas
411,9,"islas blancas y dulces como caderas frescas,"
412,9,
413,9,tiembla en la noche húmeda mi vestido de besos
414,9,"locamente cargado de eléctricas gestiones,"
415,9,de modo heroico dividido en sueños
416,9,"y embriagadoras rosas practicándose en mí,"
417,9,
418,9,"aguas arriba, en medio de las olas externas,"
419,9,tu paralelo cuerpo se sujeta en mis brazos
420,9,como un pez infinitamente pegado a mi alma
421,9,"rápido y lento en la energía subceleste,"
422,10,you've asked me what the lobster is weaving there with
423,10,       his golden feet?
424,10,"i reply, the ocean knows this,"
425,10,"you say, what is the ascidia waiting for in its transparent"
426,10,       bell? what is it waiting for?
427,10,"i tell you it is waiting for time, like you,"
428,10,you ask me whom the macrocystis alga hugs in its arms?
429,10,"study, study it, at a certain hour, in a certain sea i know,"
430,10,"you question me about the wicked tusk of the narwhal,"
431,10,       and i reply by describing
432,10,"how the sea unicorn with the harpoon in it dies,"
433,10,"you enquire about the kingfisher's feathers,"
434,10,which tremble in the pure springs of the southern tides?
435,10,or you've found in the cards a new question touching on
436,10,       the crystal architecture
437,10,"of the sea anemone, and you'll deal that to me now?"
438,10,you want to understand the electric nature of the ocean
439,10,       spines?
440,10,    the armored stalactite that breaks as it walks?
441,10,"    the hook of the angler fish, the music stretched out"
442,10,    in the deep places like a thread in the water?
443,10,
444,10,"    i want to tell you the ocean knows this, that life in its"
445,10,       jewel boxes
446,10,"    is endless as the sand, impossible to count, pure,"
447,10,    and among the blood-colored grapes time has made the
448,10,       petal
449,10,"    hard and shiny, made the jellyfish full of light"
450,10,"    and untied its knot, letting its musical threads fall"
451,10,"    from a horn of plenty made of infinite mother-of-pearl,"
452,10,
453,10,    i am nothing but the empty net which has gone on ahead
454,10,"    of human eyes, dead in those darknesses,"
455,10,"    of fingers accustomed to the triangle, longitudes"
456,10,"    on the timid globe of an orange,"
457,10,
458,10,"    i walked around as you do, investigating"
459,10,"    the endless star,"
460,10,"    and in my net, during the night, i woke up naked,"
461,10,"    the only thing caught, a fish trapped inside the wind,"
462,11,"beloved of the rivers,beset"
463,11,"by azure water and transparent drops,"
464,11,like a tree of veins your spectre
465,11,"of dark goddess biting apples,"
466,11,and then awakening naked
467,11,"to be tattoed by the rivers,"
468,11,and in the wet heights your head
469,11,"filled the world with new dew,"
470,11,
471,11,"water rose to your waist,"
472,11,you are made of wellsprings
473,11,"and lakes shone on your forehead,"
474,11,from your sources of density you drew
475,11,water like vital tears
476,11,and hauled the riverbeds to the sand
477,11,"across the planetary night,"
478,11,"crossing rough, dilated stone,"
479,11,breaking down on the way
480,11,"all the salt of geology,"
481,11,cutting through forests of compact walls
482,11,"dislodging the muscles of quartz,"
483,12,fleas interest me so much
484,12,"that i let them bite me for hours,"
485,12,"they are perfect, ancient, sanskrit,"
486,12,"machines that admit of no appeal,"
487,12,"they do not bite to eat,"
488,12,they bite only to jump;
489,12,"they are the dancers of the celestial sphere,"
490,12,delicate acrobats
491,12,in the softest and most profound circus;
492,12,"let them gallop on my skin,"
493,12,"divulge their emotions,"
494,12,"amuse themselves with my blood,"
495,12,"but someone should introduce them to me,"
496,12,"i want to know them closely,"
497,12,"i want to know what to rely on,"
498,13,"rise up to be born with me, brother,"
499,13,give me your hand from the deep
500,13,"zone seeded by your sorrow,"
501,13,"you won’t return from under the rocks,"
502,13,"you won’t return from your subterranean time,"
503,13,"your hardened voice won’t return,"
504,13,"your gouged-out eyes won’t return,"
505,13,
506,13,"look at me from the depth of the earth,"
507,13,"laborer, weaver, silent shepherd,"
508,13,"tamer of wild llamas like spirit images,"
509,13,"construction worker on a daring scaffold,"
510,13,"waterer of the tears of the andes,"
511,13,"jeweler with broken fingers,"
512,13,"farmer trembling as you sow,"
513,13,"potter, poured out into your clay,"
514,13,bring to the cup of this new life
515,13,"your old buried sorrows,"
516,13,"show me your blood and your furrow,"
517,13,"tell me, “here i was punished,"
518,13,because the jewel didn’t shine or the earth
519,13,"didn’t yield grain or stones on time,”"
520,13,show me the stone you fell over
521,13,"and the wood on which they crucified you,"
522,13,"make a spark from the old flints for me,"
523,13,for the old lamps to show the whips still stuck
524,13,after centuries in the old wounds
525,13,"and the axes shining with blood,"
526,13,"i come to speak for your dead mouth,"
527,13,across the earth come together all
528,13,the silent worn-out lips
529,13,and from the depth speak to me all this long night
530,13,"like i was pinned down there with you,"
531,13,"tell me all, chain by chain,"
532,13,"link by link and step by step,"
533,13,"sharpen the knives which you hid,"
534,13,"put them in my breast and in my hand,"
535,13,like a river of yellow lighting
536,13,like a river of buried jaguars
537,13,"and let me weep, hours, days, years,"
538,13,"for blind ages, cycles of stars,"
539,13,
540,13,"give me silence, water, hope,"
541,13,
542,13,"give me struggle, iron, volcanoes,"
543,13,
544,13,"stick bodies to me like magnets,"
545,13,
546,13,"draw near to my veins and my mouth,"
547,13,
548,13,"speak through my words and my blood,"
549,14,the names of god and especially those of his representative  
550,14,who is called jesus or christ according to holy books and  
551,14,    someone's mouth  
552,14,"these names have been used, worn out and left  "
553,14,on the shores of rivers of of human lives  
554,14,"like the empty shells of a mollusk,  "
555,14,however when we touch these sacred but exhausted  
556,14,"names, these wounded scattered petals  "
557,14,which have come out of the oceans of love and fear  
558,14,"something still remains, a sip of water,  "
559,14,"a rainbow footprint that still shimmers in the light,  "
560,14,while the names of god were used  
561,14,"by the best and the worst, by the clean and the dirty  "
562,14,"by the white and the black, by bloody murderers  "
563,14,and by victims flaming gold with napalm  
564,14,while nixon with his hands  
565,14,"of cain blessed those whom he condemned to death,  "
566,14,while fewer and fewer divine footprints were found  
567,14,    on the beach  
568,14,"people began to study colors,  "
569,14,"the future of honey, the sign of uranium  "
570,14,they looked with anxiety and hope for the possibilities  
571,14,"of killing themselves or not killing themselves, of organizing  "
572,14,    themselves into a fabric  
573,14,"of going further on, of breaking through limits without stopping  "
574,14,
575,14,what we came across in these blood thirsty times  
576,14,"with their smoke of burning trash, their dead ashes  "
577,14,as we weren't able to stop looking  
578,14,we often stopped to look at the names of god  
579,14,we lifted them with tenderness because they reminded us  
580,14,"of our ancestors, of the first people, those who said the prayers  "
581,14,those who discovered the hymn that united them in misfortune  
582,14,and now seeing the empty fragments which sheltered those  
583,14,    ancient people  
584,14,"we feel those smooth substances,  "
585,14,"worn out and used up by good and by evil,"
586,15,"the young maricones and the horny muchachas,"
587,15,"the big fat widows delirious from insomnia,"
588,15,"the young wives thirty hours' pregnant,"
589,15,"and the hoarse tomcats that cross my garden at night,"
590,15,like a collar of palpitating sexual oysters
591,15,"surround my solitary home,"
592,15,"enemies of my soul,"
593,15,conspirators in pajamas
594,15,"who exchange deep kisses for passwords,"
595,15,radiant summer brings out the lovers
596,15,"in melancholy regiments,"
597,15,fat and thin and happy and sad couples;
598,15,"under the elegant coconut palms, near the ocean and moon,"
599,15,"there is a continual life of pants and panties,"
600,15,"a hum from the fondling of silk stockings,"
601,15,"and women's breasts that glisten like eyes,"
602,15,"the salary man, after a while,"
603,15,"after the week's tedium, and the novels read in bed at night,"
604,15,"has decisively fucked his neighbor,"
605,15,"and now takes her to the miserable movies,"
606,15,"where the heroes are horses or passionate princes,"
607,15,and he caresses her legs covered with sweet down
608,15,"with his ardent and sweaty palms that smell like cigarettes,"
609,15,the night of the hunter and the night of the husband
610,15,"come together like bed sheets and bury me,"
611,15,"and the hours after lunch, when the students and priests are masturbating,"
612,15,"and the animals mount each other openly,"
613,15,"and the bees smell of blood, and the flies buzz cholerically,"
614,15,"and cousins play strange games with cousins,"
615,15,"and doctors glower at the husband of the young patient,"
616,15,"and the early morning in which the professor, without a thought,"
617,15,"pays his conjugal debt and eats breakfast,"
618,15,"and to top it all off, the adulterers, who love each other truly"
619,15,"on beds big and tall as ships,"
620,15,"so, eternally,"
621,15,this twisted and breathing forest crushes me
622,15,with gigantic flowers like mouth and teeth
623,15,"and black roots like fingernails and shoes,"
624,16,"here i love you,"
625,16,"in the dark pines the wind disentangles itself,"
626,16,"the moon glows like phosphorous on the vagrant waters,"
627,16,"days, all one kind, go chasing each other,"
628,16,
629,16,"the snow unfurls in dancing figures,"
630,16,"a silver gull slips down from the west,"
631,16,"sometimes a sail, high, high stars,"
632,16,"oh the black cross of a ship,"
633,16,"alone,"
634,16,
635,16,"sometimes i get up early and even my soul is wet,"
636,16,"far away the sea sounds and resounds,"
637,16,"this is a port,"
638,16,
639,16,"here i love you,"
640,16,"here i love you and the horizon hides you in vain,"
641,16,"i love you still among these cold things,"
642,16,sometimes my kisses go on those heavy vessels
643,16,"that cross the sea towards no arrival,"
644,16,"i see myself forgotten like those old anchors,"
645,16,
646,16,"the piers sadden when the afternoon moors there,"
647,16,"my life grows tired, hungry to no purpose,"
648,16,"i love what i do not have, you are so far,"
649,16,"my loathing wrestles with the slow twilights,"
650,16,"but night comes and starts to sing to me,"
651,16,
652,16,"the moon turns its clockwork dream,"
653,16,"the biggest stars look at me with your eyes,"
654,16,"and as i love you, the pines in the wind"
655,16,"want to sing your name with their leaves of wire,"
656,17,i do not love you except because i love you;
657,17,"i go from loving to not loving you,"
658,17,from waiting to not waiting for you
659,17,"my heart moves from cold to fire,"
660,17,
661,17,i love you only because it's you the one i love;
662,17,"i hate you deeply, and hating you"
663,17,"bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you"
664,17,"is that i do not see you but love you blindly,"
665,17,
666,17,maybe january light will consume
667,17,my heart with its cruel
668,17,"ray, stealing my key to true calm,"
669,17,
670,17,in this part of the story i am the one who
671,17,"dies, the only one, and i will die of love because i love you,"
672,17,"because i love you, love, in fire and blood,"
673,18,"i hunt for a sign of you in all the others,"
674,18,"in the rapid undulant river of women,"
675,18,"braids, shyly sinking eyes,"
676,18,"light step that slices, sailing through the foam,"
677,18,
678,18,"suddenly i think i can make out your nails,"
679,18,"oblong, quick, nieces of a cherry,"
680,18,"then it's your hair that passes by, and i think"
681,18,"i see your image, a bonfire, burning in the water,"
682,18,
683,18,"i searched, but no one else had your rhythms,"
684,18,"your light, the shady day you brought from the forest;"
685,18,"nobody had your tiny ears,"
686,18,
687,18,"you are whole, exact, and everything you are is one,"
688,18,"and so i go along, with you i float along, loving"
689,18,"a wide mississippi toward a feminine sea,"
690,19,"i remember you as you were in the last autumn,"
691,19,"you were the grey beret and the still heart,"
692,19,"in your eyes the flames of the twilight fought on,"
693,19,"and the leaves fell in the water of your soul,"
694,19,
695,19,clasping my arms like a climbing plant
696,19,"the leaves garnered your voice, that was slow and at peace,"
697,19,"bonfire of awe in which my thirst was burning,"
698,19,"sweet blue hyacinth twisted over my soul,"
699,19,
700,19,"i feel your eyes traveling, and the autumn is far off,"
701,19,"grey beret, voice of a bird, heart like a house"
702,19,towards which my deep longings migrated
703,19,"and my kisses fell, happy as embers,"
704,19,
705,19,"sky from a ship, field from the hills,"
706,19,"your memory is made of light, of smoke, of a still pond!"
707,19,"beyond your eyes, farther on, the evenings were blazing,"
708,19,"dry autumn leaves revolved in your soul,"
709,20,"you are going to ask, and where are the lilacs?"
710,20,and the poppy-petalled metaphysics?
711,20,and the rain repeatedly spattering
712,20,its words and drilling them full
713,20,of apertures and birds?
714,20,"i'll tell you all the news,"
715,20,
716,20,"i lived in a suburb,"
717,20,"a suburb of madrid, with bells,"
718,20,"and clocks, and trees,"
719,20,
720,20,from there you could look out
721,20,"over castille's dry face,"
722,20,"a leather ocean,"
723,20,my house was called
724,20,"the house of flowers, because in every cranny"
725,20,"geraniums burst, it was"
726,20,a good-looking house
727,20,"with its dogs and children,"
728,20,"remember, raul?"
729,20,"eh, rafel?         federico, do you remember"
730,20,from under the ground
731,20,my balconies on which
732,20,the light of june drowned flowers in your mouth?
733,20,"brother, my brother!"
734,20,everything
735,20,"loud with big voices, the salt of merchandises,"
736,20,"pile-ups of palpitating bread,"
737,20,the stalls of my suburb of arguelles with its statue
738,20,"like a drained inkwell in a swirl of hake,"
739,20,"oil flowed into spoons,"
740,20,a deep baying
741,20,"of feet and hands swelled in the streets,"
742,20,"metres, litres, the sharp"
743,20,"measure of life,"
744,20,"stacked-up fish,"
745,20,the texture of roofs with a cold sun in which
746,20,"the weather vane falters,"
747,20,"the fine, frenzied ivory of potatoes,"
748,20,"wave on wave of tomatoes rolling down the sea,"
749,20,
750,20,"and one morning all that was burning,"
751,20,one morning the bonfires
752,20,leapt out of the earth
753,20,devouring human beings --
754,20,"and from then on fire,"
755,20,"gunpowder from then on,"
756,20,"and from then on blood,"
757,20,"bandits with planes and moors,"
758,20,"bandits with finger-rings and duchesses,"
759,20,bandits with black friars spattering blessings
760,20,came through the sky to kill children
761,20,and the blood of children ran through the streets
762,20,"without fuss, like children's blood,"
763,20,
764,20,"jackals that the jackals would despise,"
765,20,"stones that the dry thistle would bite on and spit out,"
766,20,vipers that the vipers would abominate!
767,20,
768,20,face to face with you i have seen the blood
769,20,of spain tower like a tide
770,20,to drown you in one wave
771,20,of pride and knives!
772,20,
773,20,treacherous
774,20,"generals,"
775,20,"see my dead house,"
776,20,"look at broken spain ,"
777,20,from every house burning metal flows
778,20,"instead of flowers,"
779,20,from every socket of spain
780,20,spain emerges
781,20,"and from every dead child a rifle with eyes,"
782,20,and from every crime bullets are born
783,20,which will one day find
784,20,"the bull's eye of your hearts,"
785,20,
786,20,"and you'll ask, why doesn't his poetry"
787,20,speak of dreams and leaves
788,20,and the great volcanoes of his native land?
789,20,
790,20,"come and see the blood in the streets,"
791,20,come and see
792,20,"the blood in the streets,"
793,20,come and see the blood
794,20,in the streets!
795,21,i want you to know
796,21,"one thing,"
797,21,
798,21,"you know how this is,"
799,21,if i look
800,21,"at the crystal moon, at the red branch"
801,21,"of the slow autumn at my window,"
802,21,if i touch
803,21,near the fire
804,21,the impalpable ash
805,21,"or the wrinkled body of the log,"
806,21,"everything carries me to you,"
807,21,"as if everything that exists,"
808,21,"aromas, light, metals,"
809,21,were little boats
810,21,that sail
811,21,"toward those isles of yours that wait for me,"
812,21,
813,21,"well, now,"
814,21,if little by little you stop loving me
815,21,"i shall stop loving you little by little,"
816,21,
817,21,if suddenly
818,21,you forget me
819,21,"do not look for me,"
820,21,"for i shall already have forgotten you,"
821,21,
822,21,"if you think it long and mad,"
823,21,the wind of banners
824,21,"that passes through my life,"
825,21,and you decide
826,21,to leave me at the shore
827,21,"of the heart where i have roots,"
828,21,remember
829,21,"that on that day,"
830,21,"at that hour,"
831,21,i shall lift my arms
832,21,and my roots will set off
833,21,"to seek another land,"
834,21,
835,21,but
836,21,"if each day,"
837,21,"each hour,"
838,21,you feel that you are destined for me
839,21,"with implacable sweetness,"
840,21,if each day a flower
841,21,"climbs up to your lips to seek me,"
842,21,"ah my love, ah my own,"
843,21,"in me all that fire is repeated,"
844,21,"in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,"
845,21,"my love feeds on your love, beloved,"
846,21,and as long as you live it will be in your arms
847,21,"without leaving mine,"
848,22,in my sky at twilight you are like a cloud
849,22,"and your form and colour are the way i love them,"
850,22,"you are mine, mine, woman with sweet lips"
851,22,"and in your life my infinite dreams live,"
852,22,
853,22,"the lamp of my soul dyes your feet,"
854,22,"the sour wine is sweeter on your lips,"
855,22,"oh reaper of my evening song,"
856,22,how solitary dreams believe you to be mine!
857,22,
858,22,"you are mine, mine, i go shouting it to the afternoon's"
859,22,"wind, and the wind hauls on my widowed voice,"
860,22,"huntress of the depth of my eyes, your plunder"
861,22,"stills your nocturnal regard as though it were water,"
862,22,
863,22,"you are taken in the net of my music, my love,"
864,22,"and my nets of music are wide as the sky,"
865,22,"my soul is born on the shore of your eyes of mourning,"
866,22,"in your eyes of mourning the land of dreams begin,"
867,23,little
868,23,"rose,"
869,23,"roselet,"
870,23,"at times,"
871,23,"tiny and naked,"
872,23,it seems
873,23,as though you would fit
874,23,"in one of my hands,"
875,23,as though i’ll clasp you like this
876,23,"and carry you to my mouth,"
877,23,but
878,23,suddenly
879,23,"my feet touch your feet and my mouth your lips,"
880,23,"you have grown,"
881,23,"your shoulders rise like two hills,"
882,23,"your breasts wander over my breast,"
883,23,my arm scarcely manages to encircle the thin
884,23,"new-moon line of your waist,"
885,23,"in love you loosened yourself like sea water,"
886,23,i can scarcely measure the sky’s most spacious eyes
887,23,"and i lean down to your mouth to kiss the earth,"
888,24,leaning into the afternoons i cast my sad nets
889,24,"towards your oceanic eyes,"
890,24,
891,24,"there in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames,"
892,24,"its arms turning like a drowning man's,"
893,24,
894,24,i send out red signals across your absent eyes
895,24,"that smell like the sea or the beach by a lighthouse,"
896,24,
897,24,"you keep only darkness, my distant female,"
898,24,"from your regard sometimes the coast of dread emerges,"
899,24,
900,24,leaning into the afternoons i fling my sad nets
901,24,"to that sea that is thrashed by your oceanic eyes,"
902,24,
903,24,the birds of night peck at the first stars
904,24,"that flash like my soul when i love you,"
905,24,
906,24,the night gallops on its shadowy mare
907,24,"shedding blue tassels over the land,"
908,25,"lost in the forest, i broke off a dark twig"
909,25,"and lifted its whisper to my thirsty lips,"
910,25,"maybe it was the voice of the rain crying,"
911,25,"a cracked bell, or a torn heart,"
912,25,
913,25,something from far off it seemed
914,25,"deep and secret to me, hidden by the earth,"
915,25,"a shout muffled by huge autumns,"
916,25,"by the moist half-open darkness of the leaves,"
917,25,
918,25,"wakening from the dreaming forest there, the hazel-sprig"
919,25,"sang under my tongue, its drifting fragrance"
920,25,climbed up through my conscious mind
921,25,
922,25,as if suddenly the roots i had left behind
923,25,"cried out to me, the land i had lost with my childhood---"
924,25,"and i stopped, wounded by the wandering scent,"
925,26,"what's wrong with you, with us,"
926,26,what's happening to us?
927,26,ah our love is a harsh cord
928,26,that binds us wounding us
929,26,and if we want
930,26,"to leave our wound,"
931,26,"to separate,"
932,26,it makes a new knot for us and condemns us
933,26,"to drain our blood and burn together,"
934,26,
935,26,what's wrong with you? i look at you
936,26,and i find nothing in you but two eyes
937,26,"like all eyes, a mouth"
938,26,"lost among a thousand mouths that i have kissed, more beautiful,"
939,26,a body just like those that have slipped
940,26,"beneath my body without leaving any memory,"
941,26,
942,26,and how empty you went through the world
943,26,like a wheat-colored jar
944,26,"without air, without sound, without substance!"
945,26,i vainly sought in you
946,26,depth for my arms
947,26,"that dig, without cease, beneath the earth,"
948,26,"beneath your skin, beneath your eyes,"
949,26,"nothing,"
950,26,beneath your double breast scarcely
951,26,raised
952,26,a current of crystalline order
953,26,"that does not know why it flows singing,"
954,26,"why, why, why,"
955,26,"my love, why?"
956,27,"love, we're going home now,"
957,27,"where the vines clamber over the trellis,"
958,27,"even before you, the summer will arrive,"
959,27,"on its honeysuckle feet, in your bedroom,"
960,27,
961,27,"our nomadic kisses wandered over all the world,"
962,27,"armenia, dollop of disinterred honey,"
963,27,"ceylon, green dove, and the yangtse with its old"
964,27,"old patience, dividing the day from the night,"
965,27,
966,27,"and now, dearest, we return, across the crackling sea"
967,27,"like two blind birds to their wall,"
968,27,"to their nest in a distant spring,"
969,27,
970,27,"because love cannot always fly without resting,"
971,27,"our lives return to the wall, to the rocks of the sea,"
972,27,"our kisses head back home where they belong,"
973,28,"lovely one,"
974,28,just as on the cool stone
975,28,"of the spring, the water"
976,28,"opens a wide flash of foam,"
977,28,"so is the smile of your face,"
978,28,"lovely one,"
979,28,
980,28,"lovely one,"
981,28,with delicate hands and slender feet
982,28,"like a silver pony,"
983,28,"walking, flower of the world,"
984,28,"thus i see you,"
985,28,"lovely one,"
986,28,
987,28,"lovely one,"
988,28,with a nest of copper entangled
989,28,"on your head, a nest"
990,28,the colour of dark honey
991,28,"where my heart burns and rests,"
992,28,"lovely one,"
993,28,
994,28,"lovely one,"
995,28,"your eyes are too big for your face,"
996,28,"your eyes are too big for the earth,"
997,28,
998,28,"there are countries, there are rivers,"
999,28,"in your eyes,"
1000,28,"my country is your eyes,"
1001,28,"i walk through them,"
1002,28,they light the world
1003,28,"through which i walk,"
1004,28,"lovely one,"
1005,28,
1006,28,"lovely one,"
1007,28,your breasts are like two loaves made
1008,28,"of grainy earth and golden moon,"
1009,28,"lovely one,"
1010,28,
1011,28,"lovely one,"
1012,28,"your waist,"
1013,28,my arm shaped it like a river when
1014,28,"it flowed a thousand years through your sweet body,"
1015,28,"lovely one,"
1016,28,
1017,28,"lovely one,"
1018,28,"there is nothing like your hips,"
1019,28,perhaps earth has
1020,28,in some hidden place
1021,28,"the curve and the fragrance of your body,"
1022,28,"perhaps in some place,"
1023,28,"lovely one,"
1024,28,
1025,28,"lovely one, my lovely one,"
1026,28,"your voice, your skin, your nails,"
1027,28,"lovely one, my lovely one,"
1028,28,"your being, your light, your shadow,"
1029,28,"lovely one,"
1030,28,"all that is mine, lovely one,"
1031,28,"all that is mine, my dear,"
1032,28,"when you walk or rest,"
1033,28,"when you sing or sleep,"
1034,28,"when you suffer or dream,"
1035,28,"always,"
1036,28,"when you are near or far,"
1037,28,"always,"
1038,28,"you are mine, my lovely one,"
1039,28,"always,"
1040,29,"because of you, in gardens of blossoming"
1041,29,"flowers i ache from the perfumes of spring,"
1042,29,"i have forgotten your face, i no longer"
1043,29,remember your hands; how did your lips
1044,29,"feel on mine?,"
1045,29,
1046,29,"because of you, i love the white statues"
1047,29,"drowsing in the parks, the white statues that"
1048,29,"have neither voice nor sight,"
1049,29,
1050,29,"i have forgotten your voice, your happy voice;"
1051,29,"i have forgotten your eyes,"
1052,29,
1053,29,"like a flower to its perfume, i am bound to"
1054,29,"my vague memory of you, i live with pain"
1055,29,"that is like a wound; if you touch me, you will"
1056,29,"make to me an irreperable harm,"
1057,29,
1058,29,"your caresses enfold me, like climbing"
1059,29,"vines on melancholy walls,"
1060,29,
1061,29,"i have forgotten your love, yet i seem to"
1062,29,"glimpse you in every window,"
1063,29,
1064,29,"because of you, the heady perfumes of"
1065,29,"summer pain me; because of you, i again"
1066,29,"seek out the signs that precipitate desires,"
1067,29,"shooting stars, falling objects,"
1068,30,neither clown nor child nor black
1069,30,nor white but verticle
1070,30,and a questioning innocence
1071,30,"dressed in night and snow,"
1072,30,"the mother smiles at the sailor,"
1073,30,"the fisherman at the astronaunt,"
1074,30,but the child child does not smile
1075,30,"when he looks at the bird child,"
1076,30,and from the disorderly ocean
1077,30,the immaculate passenger
1078,30,"emerges in snowy mourning,"
1079,30,
1080,30,i was without doubt the child bird
1081,30,there in the cold archipelagoes
1082,30,"when it looked at me with its eyes,"
1083,30,"with its ancient ocean eyes,"
1084,30,it had neither arms nor wings
1085,30,but hard little oars
1086,30,"on its sides,"
1087,30,it was as old as the salt;
1088,30,"the age of moving water,"
1089,30,"and it looked at me from its age,"
1090,30,since then i know i do not exist;
1091,30,"i am a worm in the sand,"
1092,30,
1093,30,the reasons for my respect
1094,30,"remained in the sand,"
1095,30,the religious bird
1096,30,"did not need to fly,"
1097,30,"did not need to sing,"
1098,30,and through its form was visible
1099,30,"its wild soul bled salt,"
1100,30,as if a vein from the bitter sea
1101,30,"had been broken,"
1102,30,
1103,30,"penguin, static traveler,"
1104,30,"deliberate priest of the cold,"
1105,30,i salute your vertical salt
1106,30,"and envy your plumed pride,"
1107,31,"naked, you are simple as one of your hands,"
1108,31,"smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round,"
1109,31,"you have moonlines, applepathways,"
1110,31,"naked, you are slender as a naked grain of wheat,"
1111,31,
1112,31,"naked, you are blue as the night in cuba;"
1113,31,you have vines and stars in your hair;
1114,31,"naked, you are spacious and yellow"
1115,31,"as summer in a golden church,"
1116,31,
1117,31,"naked, you are tiny as one of your nails,"
1118,31,"curved, subtle, rosy, till the day is born"
1119,31,"and you withdraw to the underground world,"
1120,31,
1121,31,"as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores,"
1122,31,"your clear light dims, gets dressed, drops its leaves,"
1123,31,"and becomes a naked hand again,"
1124,32,"there are cemeteries that are lonely,"
1125,32,"graves full of bones that do not make a sound,"
1126,32,"the heart moving through a tunnel,"
1127,32,"in it darkness, darkness, darkness,"
1128,32,"like a shipwreck we die going into ourselves,"
1129,32,"as though we were drowning inside our hearts,"
1130,32,"as though we lived falling out of the skin into the soul,"
1131,32,
1132,32,"and there are corpses,"
1133,32,"feet made of cold and sticky clay,"
1134,32,"death is inside the bones,"
1135,32,"like a barking where there are no dogs,"
1136,32,"coming out from bells somewhere, from graves somewhere,"
1137,32,"growing in the damp air like tears of rain,"
1138,32,
1139,32,sometimes i see alone
1140,32,"coffins under sail,"
1141,32,"embarking with the pale dead, with women that have dead hair,"
1142,32,"with bakers who are as white as angels,"
1143,32,"and pensive young girls married to notary publics,"
1144,32,"caskets sailing up the vertical river of the dead,"
1145,32,"the river of dark purple,"
1146,32,"moving upstream with sails filled out by the sound of death,"
1147,32,"filled by the sound of death which is silence,"
1148,32,
1149,32,death arrives among all that sound
1150,32,"like a shoe with no foot in it, like a suit with no man in it,"
1151,32,"comes and knocks, using a ring with no stone in it, with no"
1152,32,"    finger in it,"
1153,32,"comes and shouts with no mouth, with no tongue, with no"
1154,32,"    throat,"
1155,32,nevertheless its steps can be heard
1156,32,"and its clothing makes a hushed sound, like a tree,"
1157,32,
1158,32,"i'm not sure, i understand only a little, i can hardly see,"
1159,32,"but it seems to me that its singing has the color of damp violets,"
1160,32,"of violets that are at home in the earth,"
1161,32,"because the face of death is green,"
1162,32,"and the look death gives is green,"
1163,32,with the penetrating dampness of a violet leaf
1164,32,"and the somber color of embittered winter,"
1165,32,
1166,32,"but death also goes through the world dressed as a broom,"
1167,32,"lapping the floor, looking for dead bodies,"
1168,32,"death is inside the broom,"
1169,32,"the broom is the tongue of death looking for corpses,"
1170,32,"it is the needle of death looking for thread,"
1171,32,
1172,32,"death is inside the folding cots,"
1173,32,"it spends its life sleeping on the slow mattresses,"
1174,32,"in the black blankets, and suddenly breathes out,"
1175,32,"it blows out a mournful sound that swells the sheets,"
1176,32,and the beds go sailing toward a port
1177,32,"where death is waiting, dressed like an admiral,"
1178,33,now
1179,33,let's look for birds!
1180,33,the tall iron branches
1181,33,"in the forest,"
1182,33,the dense
1183,33,"fertility on the ground,"
1184,33,the world
1185,33,"is wet,"
1186,33,a dewdrop or raindrop
1187,33,"shines,"
1188,33,a diminutive star
1189,33,"among the leaves,"
1190,33,the morning time
1191,33,mother earth
1192,33,"is cool,"
1193,33,the air
1194,33,is like a river
1195,33,which shakes
1196,33,"the silence,"
1197,33,"it smells of rosemary,"
1198,33,of space
1199,33,"and roots,"
1200,33,"overhead,"
1201,33,"a crazy song,"
1202,33,"it's a bird,"
1203,33,how
1204,33,out of its throat
1205,33,smaller than a finger
1206,33,can there fall the waters
1207,33,of its song?
1208,33,luminous ease!
1209,33,invisible
1210,33,power
1211,33,torrent
1212,33,of music
1213,33,"in the leaves,"
1214,33,sacred conversations!
1215,33,clean and fresh washed
1216,33,is this
1217,33,day resounding
1218,33,"like a green dulcimer,"
1219,33,i bury
1220,33,my shoes
1221,33,"in the mud,"
1222,33,"jump over rivulets,"
1223,33,a thorn
1224,33,bites me and a gust
1225,33,of air like a crystal
1226,33,wave
1227,33,"splits up inside my chest,"
1228,33,where
1229,33,are the birds?
1230,33,maybe it was
1231,33,that
1232,33,rustling in the foliage
1233,33,or that fleeting pellet
1234,33,of brown velvet
1235,33,or that displaced
1236,33,perfume? that
1237,33,leaf that let loose cinnamon smell
1238,33,- was that a bird? that dust
1239,33,from an irritated magnolia
1240,33,or that fruit
1241,33,which fell with a thump -
1242,33,was that a flight?
1243,33,"oh, invisible little"
1244,33,critters
1245,33,birds of the devil
1246,33,with their ringing
1247,33,"with their useless feathers,"
1248,33,i only want
1249,33,"to caress them,"
1250,33,"to see them resplendent,"
1251,33,i don't want
1252,33,to see under glass
1253,33,"the embalmed lightning,"
1254,33,"i want to see them living,"
1255,33,i want to touch their gloves
1256,33,"of real hide,"
1257,33,which they never forget in
1258,33,the branches
1259,33,and to converse with
1260,33,them
1261,33,sitting on my shoulders
1262,33,although they may leave
1263,33,me like certain statues
1264,33,"undeservedly whitewashed,"
1265,33,"impossible,"
1266,33,"you can't touch them,"
1267,33,you can hear them
1268,33,like a heavenly
1269,33,"rustle or movement,"
1270,33,they converse
1271,33,"with precision,"
1272,33,they repeat
1273,33,"their observations,"
1274,33,they brag
1275,33,"of how much they do,"
1276,33,they comment
1277,33,"on everything that exists,"
1278,33,they learn
1279,33,certain sciences
1280,33,"like hydrography,"
1281,33,and by a sure science
1282,33,they know
1283,33,where there are harvests
1284,33,of grain
1285,34,"america, from a grain"
1286,34,of maize you grew
1287,34,to crown
1288,34,with spacious lands
1289,34,"the ocean foam,"
1290,34,"a grain of maize was your geography,"
1291,34,from the grain
1292,34,"a green lance rose,"
1293,34,"was covered with gold,"
1294,34,to grace the heights
1295,34,"of peru with its yellow tassels,"
1296,34,
1297,34,"but, poet, let"
1298,34,history rest in its shroud;
1299,34,praise with your lyre
1300,34,"the grain in its granaries,"
1301,34,"sing to the simple maize in the kitchen,"
1302,34,
1303,34,"first, a fine beard"
1304,34,fluttered in the field
1305,34,above the tender teeth
1306,34,"of the young ear,"
1307,34,then the husks parted
1308,34,and fruitfulness burst its veils
1309,34,of pale papyrus
1310,34,that grains of laughter
1311,34,"might fall upon the earth,"
1312,34,"to the stone,"
1313,34,"in your journey,"
1314,34,"you returned,"
1315,34,"not to the terrible stone,"
1316,34,the bloody
1317,34,"triangle of mexican death,"
1318,34,"but to the grinding stone,"
1319,34,sacred
1320,34,"stone of your kitchens,"
1321,34,"there, milk and matter,"
1322,34,"strength-giving, nutritious"
1323,34,"cornmeal pulp,"
1324,34,you were worked and patted
1325,34,by the wondrous hands
1326,34,"of dark-skinned women,"
1327,34,
1328,34,"wherever you fall, maize,"
1329,34,whether into the
1330,34,"splendid pot of partridge, or among"
1331,34,"country beans, you light up"
1332,34,the meal and lend it
1333,34,"your virginal flavor,"
1334,34,
1335,34,"oh, to bite into"
1336,34,the steaming ear beside the sea
1337,34,"of distant song and deepest waltz,"
1338,34,to boil you
1339,34,as your aroma
1340,34,spreads through
1341,34,"blue sierras,"
1342,34,
1343,34,but is there
1344,34,no end
1345,34,to your treasure?
1346,34,
1347,34,"in chalky, barren lands"
1348,34,bordered
1349,34,"by the sea, along"
1350,34,"the rocky chilean coast,"
1351,34,at times
1352,34,only your radiance
1353,34,reaches the empty
1354,34,"table of the miner,"
1355,34,
1356,34,"your light, your cornmeal, your hope"
1357,34,"pervades america's solitudes,"
1358,34,and to hunger
1359,34,your lances
1360,34,"are enemy legions,"
1361,34,
1362,34,"within your husks,"
1363,34,"like gentle kernels,"
1364,34,our sober provincial
1365,34,"children's hearts were nurtured,"
1366,34,until life began
1367,34,"to shuck us from the ear,"
1368,35,"sadness, scarab"
1369,35,"with seven crippled feet,"
1370,35,"spiderweb egg,"
1371,35,"scramble-brained rat,"
1372,35,"bitch's skeleton,"
1373,35,"no entry here,"
1374,35,"don't come in,"
1375,35,"go away,"
1376,35,go back
1377,35,"south with your umbrella,"
1378,35,go back
1379,35,"north with your serpent's teeth,"
1380,35,"a poet lives here,"
1381,35,no sadness may
1382,35,"cross this threshold,"
1383,35,through these windows
1384,35,"comes the breath of the world,"
1385,35,"fresh red roses,"
1386,35,flags embroidered with
1387,35,"the victories of the people,"
1388,35,"no,"
1389,35,"no entry,"
1390,35,flap
1391,35,"your bat's wings,"
1392,35,i will trample the feathers
1393,35,"that fall from your mantle,"
1394,35,i will sweep the bits and pieces
1395,35,of your carcass to
1396,35,"the four corners of the wind,"
1397,35,"i will wring your neck,"
1398,35,"i will stitch your eyelids shut,"
1399,35,"i will sew your shroud,"
1400,35,"sadness, and bury your rodent bones"
1401,35,"beneath the springtime of an apple tree,"
1402,36,the artichoke
1403,36,with a tender heart
1404,36,"dressed up like a warrior,"
1405,36,"standing at attention, it built"
1406,36,a small helmet
1407,36,under its scales
1408,36,it remained
1409,36,"unshakeable,"
1410,36,by its side
1411,36,the crazy vegetables
1412,36,uncurled
1413,36,"their tendrills and leaf-crowns,"
1414,36,"throbbing bulbs,"
1415,36,in the sub-soil
1416,36,the carrot
1417,36,with its red mustaches
1418,36,"was sleeping,"
1419,36,the grapevine
1420,36,hung out to dry its branches
1421,36,"through which the wine will rise,"
1422,36,the cabbage
1423,36,dedicated itself
1424,36,"to trying on skirts,"
1425,36,the oregano
1426,36,"to perfuming the world,"
1427,36,and the sweet
1428,36,artichoke
1429,36,"there in the garden,"
1430,36,"dressed like a warrior,"
1431,36,burnished
1432,36,like a proud
1433,36,"pomegrante,"
1434,36,and one day
1435,36,side by side
1436,36,in big wicker baskets
1437,36,walking through the market
1438,36,to realize their dream
1439,36,the artichoke army
1440,36,"in formation,"
1441,36,never was it so military
1442,36,"like on parade,"
1443,36,the men
1444,36,in their white shirts
1445,36,among the vegetables
1446,36,were
1447,36,the marshals
1448,36,of the artichokes
1449,36,lines in close order
1450,36,"command voices,"
1451,36,and the bang
1452,36,"of a falling box,"
1453,36,
1454,36,but
1455,36,then
1456,36,maria
1457,36,comes
1458,36,with her basket
1459,36,she chooses
1460,36,"an artichoke,"
1461,36,"she's not afraid of it,"
1462,36,"she examines it, she observes it"
1463,36,"up against the light like it was an egg,"
1464,36,"she buys it,"
1465,36,she mixes it up
1466,36,in her handbag
1467,36,with a pair of shoes
1468,36,with a cabbage head and a
1469,36,bottle
1470,36,of vinegar
1471,36,until
1472,36,she enters the kitchen
1473,36,"and submerges it in a pot,"
1474,36,
1475,36,thus ends
1476,36,in peace
1477,36,this career
1478,36,of the armed vegetable
1479,36,"which is called an artichoke,"
1480,36,then
1481,36,"scale by scale,"
1482,36,we strip off
1483,36,the delicacy
1484,36,and eat
1485,36,the peaceful mush
1486,36,"of its green heart,"
1487,37,when i close a book
1488,37,"i open life,"
1489,37,i hear
1490,37,faltering cries
1491,37,"among harbours,"
1492,37,copper ignots
1493,37,slide down sand-pits
1494,37,"to tocopilla,"
1495,37,"night time,"
1496,37,among the islands
1497,37,our ocean
1498,37,"throbs with fish,"
1499,37,"touches the feet, the thighs,"
1500,37,the chalk ribs
1501,37,"of my country,"
1502,37,the whole of night
1503,37,"clings to its shores, by dawn"
1504,37,it wakes up singing
1505,37,"as if it had excited a guitar,"
1506,37,
1507,37,"the ocean's surge is calling,"
1508,37,the wind
1509,37,calls me
1510,37,"and rodriguez calls,"
1511,37,and jose antonio--
1512,37,i got a telegram
1513,37,from the 'mine' union
1514,37,and the one i love
1515,37,whose name i won't let out
1516,37,"expects me in bucalemu,"
1517,37,
1518,37,no book has been able
1519,37,"to wrap me in paper,"
1520,37,to fill me up
1521,37,"with typography,"
1522,37,with heavenly imprints
1523,37,or was ever able
1524,37,"to bind my eyes,"
1525,37,i come out of books to people orchards
1526,37,"with the hoarse family of my song,"
1527,37,to work the burning metals
1528,37,or to eat smoked beef
1529,37,"by mountain firesides,"
1530,37,i love adventurous
1531,37,"books,"
1532,37,"books of forest or snow,"
1533,37,depth or sky
1534,37,but hate
1535,37,the spider book
1536,37,in which thought
1537,37,has laid poisonous wires
1538,37,to trap the juvenile
1539,37,"and circling fly,"
1540,37,"book, let me go,"
1541,37,i won't go clothed
1542,37,"in volumes,"
1543,37,i don't come out
1544,37,"of collected works,"
1545,37,my poems
1546,37,have not eaten poems--
1547,37,they devour
1548,37,"exciting happenings,"
1549,37,"feed on rough weather,"
1550,37,and dig their food
1551,37,"out of earth and men,"
1552,37,i'm on my way
1553,37,with dust in my shoes
1554,37,"free of mythology,"
1555,37,"send books back to their shelves,"
1556,37,"i'm going down into the streets,"
1557,37,i learned about life
1558,37,"from life itself,"
1559,37,love i learned in a single kiss
1560,37,and could teach no one anything
1561,37,except that i have lived
1562,37,"with something in common among men,"
1563,37,"when fighting with them,"
1564,37,"when saying all their say in my song,"
1565,38,"day-colored wine,"
1566,38,"night-colored wine,"
1567,38,wine with purple feet
1568,38,"or wine with topaz blood,"
1569,38,"wine,"
1570,38,starry child
1571,38,"of earth,"
1572,38,"wine, smooth"
1573,38,"as a golden sword,"
1574,38,soft
1575,38,"as lascivious velvet,"
1576,38,"wine, spiral-seashelled"
1577,38,"and full of wonder,"
1578,38,"amorous,"
1579,38,marine;
1580,38,"never has one goblet contained you,"
1581,38,"one song, one man,"
1582,38,"you are choral, gregarious,"
1583,38,"at the least, you must be shared,"
1584,38,at times
1585,38,you feed on mortal
1586,38,memories;
1587,38,your wave carries us
1588,38,"from tomb to tomb,"
1589,38,"stonecutter of icy sepulchers,"
1590,38,and we weep
1591,38,transitory tears;
1592,38,your
1593,38,glorious
1594,38,spring dress
1595,38,"is different,"
1596,38,"blood rises through the shoots,"
1597,38,"wind incites the day,"
1598,38,nothing is left
1599,38,"of your immutable soul,"
1600,38,wine
1601,38,"stirs the spring, happiness"
1602,38,"bursts through the earth like a plant,"
1603,38,"walls crumble,"
1604,38,"and rocky cliffs,"
1605,38,"chasms close,"
1606,38,"as song is born,"
1607,38,"a jug of wine, and thou beside me"
1608,38,"in the wilderness,"
1609,38,"sang the ancient poet,"
1610,38,let the wine pitcher
1611,38,"add to the kiss of love its own,"
1612,38,
1613,38,"my darling, suddenly"
1614,38,the line of your hip
1615,38,becomes the brimming curve
1616,38,"of the wine goblet,"
1617,38,"your breast is the grape cluster,"
1618,38,"your nipples are the grapes,"
1619,38,"the gleam of spirits lights your hair,"
1620,38,and your navel is a chaste seal
1621,38,"stamped on the vessel of your belly,"
1622,38,your love an inexhaustible
1623,38,"cascade of wine,"
1624,38,"light that illuminates my senses,"
1625,38,"the earthly splendor of life,"
1626,38,
1627,38,"but you are more than love,"
1628,38,"the fiery kiss,"
1629,38,"the heat of fire,"
1630,38,more than the wine of life;
1631,38,you are
1632,38,"the community of man,"
1633,38,"translucency,"
1634,38,"chorus of discipline,"
1635,38,"abundance of flowers,"
1636,38,"i like on the table,"
1637,38,"when we're speaking,"
1638,38,the light of a bottle
1639,38,"of intelligent wine,"
1640,38,"drink it,"
1641,38,and remember in every
1642,38,"drop of gold,"
1643,38,"in every topaz glass,"
1644,38,"in every purple ladle,"
1645,38,that autumn labored
1646,38,to fill the vessel with wine;
1647,38,"and in the ritual of his office,"
1648,38,let the simple man remember
1649,38,"to think of the soil and of his duty,"
1650,38,"to propagate the canticle of the wine,"
1651,39,"and it was at that age , poetry arrived"
1652,39,"in search of me, i don't know, i don't know where"
1653,39,"it came from, from winter or a river,"
1654,39,"i don't know how or when,"
1655,39,"no they were not voices, they were not"
1656,39,"words, nor silence,"
1657,39,"but from a street i was summoned,"
1658,39,"from the branches of night,"
1659,39,"abruptly from the others,"
1660,39,among violent fires
1661,39,"or returning alone,"
1662,39,there i was without a face
1663,39,"and it touched me,"
1664,39,
1665,39,"i did not know what to say, my mouth"
1666,39,had no way
1667,39,"with names,"
1668,39,"my eyes were blind,"
1669,39,"and something started in my soul,"
1670,39,"fever or forgotten wings,"
1671,39,"and i made my own way,"
1672,39,deciphering
1673,39,"that fire,"
1674,39,"and i wrote the first faint line,"
1675,39,"faint, without substance, pure"
1676,39,"nonsense,"
1677,39,pure wisdom
1678,39,"of someone who knows nothing,"
1679,39,and suddenly i saw
1680,39,the heavens
1681,39,unfastened
1682,39,"and open,"
1683,39,"planets,"
1684,39,"palpitating plantations,"
1685,39,"shadow perforated,"
1686,39,riddled
1687,39,"with arrows, fire and flowers,"
1688,39,"the winding night, the universe,"
1689,39,
1690,39,"and i, infinitesimal being,"
1691,39,drunk with the great starry
1692,39,"void,"
1693,39,"likeness, image of"
1694,39,"mystery,"
1695,39,felt myself a pure part
1696,39,"of the abyss,"
1697,39,"i wheeled with the stars,"
1698,39,"my heart broke loose on the wind,"
1699,40,"what it takes on this planet,"
1700,40,"to make love to each other in peace,"
1701,40,"everyone pries under your sheets,"
1702,40,"everyone interferes with your loving,"
1703,40,"they say terrible things about a man and a woman,"
1704,40,"who after much milling about,"
1705,40,"all sorts of compunctions,"
1706,40,"do something unique,"
1707,40,"they both lie with each other in one bed,"
1708,40,"i ask myself whether frogs are so furtive,"
1709,40,"or sneeze as they please,"
1710,40,"whether they whisper to each other in swamps about illegitimate frogs,"
1711,40,"or the joys of amphibious living,"
1712,40,"i ask myself if birds single out enemy birds,"
1713,40,"or bulls gossip with bullocks before they go out in public with cows,"
1714,40,"even the roads have eyes and the parks their police,"
1715,40,"hotels spy on their guests,"
1716,40,"windows name names,"
1717,40,"canons and squadrons debark on missions to liquidate love,"
1718,40,"all those ears and those jaws working incessantly,"
1719,40,till a man and his girl
1720,40,"have to raise their climax,"
1721,40,"full tilt,"
1722,40,"on a bicycle,"
1723,41,"puedo escribir los versos más tristes esta noche,"
1724,41,
1725,41,"escribir, por ejemplo, 'la noche está estrellada,"
1726,41,"y tiritan, azules, los astros, a lo lejos,'"
1727,41,
1728,41,"el viento de la noche gira en el cielo y canta,"
1729,41,
1730,41,"puedo escribir los versos más tristes esta noche,"
1731,41,"yo la quise, y a veces ella también me quiso,"
1732,41,
1733,41,"en las noches como ésta la tuve entre mis brazos,"
1734,41,"la besé tantas veces bajo el cielo infinito,"
1735,41,
1736,41,"ella me quiso, a veces yo también la quería,"
1737,41,"cómo no haber amado sus grandes ojos fijos,"
1738,41,
1739,41,"puedo escribir los versos más tristes esta noche,"
1740,41,"pensar que no la tengo, sentir que la he perdido,"
1741,41,
1742,41,"oir la noche inmensa, más inmnesa sin ella,"
1743,41,"y el verso cae al alma como al pasto el rocío,"
1744,41,
1745,41,"qué importa que mi amor no pudiera guadarla,"
1746,41,"la noche está estrellada y ella no está conmigo,"
1747,41,
1748,41,"eso es todo, a lo lejos alguien canta, a lo lejos,"
1749,41,"mi alma no se contenta con haberla perdido,"
1750,41,
1751,41,"como para acercarla mi mirada la busca,"
1752,41,"mi corazón la busca, y ella no está conmigo,"
1753,41,
1754,41,"la misma noche que hace blanquear los mismos árboles,"
1755,41,"nosotros, los de entonces, ya no somos los mismos,"
1756,41,
1757,41,"ya no la quiero, es cierto, pero cuánto la quise,"
1758,41,"mi voz buscaba el viento para tocar su oído,"
1759,41,
1760,41,"de otro, será de otro, como antes de mis besos,"
1761,41,"su voz, su cuerpo claro, sus ojos infinitos,"
1762,41,
1763,41,"ya no la quiero, es cierto, pero tal vez la quiero,"
1764,41,"es tan corto el amor, y es tan largo el olvido,"
1765,41,
1766,41,"porque en noches como ésta la tuve entre mis brazos,"
1767,41,"mi alma no se contenta con haberla perdido,"
1768,41,
1769,41,"aunque éste sea el último dolor que ella me causa,"
1770,41,"y éstos sean los últimos versos que yo le escribo,"
1771,42,"it was the twilight of the iguana,"
1772,42,
1773,42,"from a rainbowing battlement,"
1774,42,a tongue like a javelin
1775,42,lunging in verdure;
1776,42,"an ant heap treading the jungle,"
1777,42,"monastic, on musical feet;"
1778,42,"the guanaco, oxygen-fine"
1779,42,"in the high places swarthed with distances,"
1780,42,cobbling his feet into gold;
1781,42,the llama of scrupulous eye
1782,42,the widens his gaze on the dews
1783,42,"of a delicate world,"
1784,42,
1785,42,a monkey is weaving
1786,42,a thread of insatiable lusts
1787,42,"on the margins of morning,"
1788,42,"he topples a pollen-fall,"
1789,42,startles the violet-flight
1790,42,"of the butterfly, wings on the muzo,"
1791,42,
1792,42,"it was the night of the alligator,"
1793,42,"snouts moving out of the slime,"
1794,42,"in original darkness, the pullulations,"
1795,42,"a clatter of armour, opaque"
1796,42,"in the sleep of the bog,"
1797,42,"turning back to the chalk of the sources,"
1798,42,
1799,42,the jaguar touches the leaves
1800,42,"with his phosphorous absence,"
1801,42,the puma speeds to his covert
1802,42,"in the blaze of his hungers,"
1803,42,"his eyeballs, a jungle of alcohol,"
1804,42,"burn in his head,"
1805,43,neither the heart cut by a piece of glass
1806,43,in a wasteland of thorns
1807,43,nor the atrocious waters seen in the corners
1808,43,"of certain houses, waters like eyelids and eyes"
1809,43,can capture your waist in my hands
1810,43,when my heart lifts its oaks
1811,43,"towards your unbreakable thread of snow,"
1812,43,
1813,43,"nocturnal sugar, spirit"
1814,43,"of the crowns,"
1815,43,ransomed
1816,43,"human blood, your kisses"
1817,43,send into exile
1818,43,"and a stroke of water, with remnants of the sea,"
1819,43,neats on the silences that wait for you
1820,43,"surrounding the worn chairs, wearing out doors,"
1821,43,
1822,43,"nights with bright spindles,"
1823,43,"divided, material, nothing"
1824,43,"but voice, nothing but"
1825,43,"naked every day,"
1826,43,
1827,43,"over your breasts of motionless current,"
1828,43,"over your legs of firmness and water,"
1829,43,over the permanence and the pride
1830,43,of your naked hair
1831,43,"i want to be, my love, now that the tears are"
1832,43,thrown
1833,43,"into the raucous baskets where they accumulate,"
1834,43,"i want to be, my love, alone with a syllable"
1835,43,"of mangled silver, alone with a tip"
1836,43,"of your breast of snow,"
1837,44,"no te amo como si fueras rosa de sal, topacio"
1838,44,"o flecha de claveles que propagan el fuego,"
1839,44,"te amo como se aman ciertas cosas oscuras,"
1840,44,"secretamente, entre la sombra y el alma,"
1841,44,
1842,44,te amo como la planta que no florece y lleva
1843,44,"dentro de sí, escondida, la luz de aquellas flores,"
1844,44,y gracias a tu amor vive oscuro en mi cuerpo
1845,44,"el apretado aroma que ascendió de la tierra,"
1846,44,
1847,44,"te amo sin saber cómo, ni cuándo, ni de dónde,"
1848,44,"te amo directamente sin problemas ni orgullo,"
1849,44,"así te amo porque no sé amar de otra manera,"
1850,44,
1851,44,"sino así de este modo en que no soy ni eres,"
1852,44,"tan cerca que tu mano sobre mi pecho es mía,"
1853,44,"tan cerca que se cierran tus ojos con mi sueño,"
1854,45,"and now you're mine,  rest with your dream in my dream,"
1855,45,"love and pain and work should all sleep, now,"
1856,45,"the night turns on its invisible wheels,"
1857,45,"and you are pure beside me as a sleeping amber,"
1858,45,
1859,45,"no one else, love, will sleep in my dreams,  you will go,"
1860,45,"we will go together, over the waters of time,"
1861,45,"no one else will travel through the shadows with me,"
1862,45,"only you, evergreen, ever sun, ever moon,"
1863,45,
1864,45,your hands have already opened their delicate fists
1865,45,and let their soft drifting signs drop away; your eyes closed like two gray
1866,45,"wings, and i move"
1867,45,
1868,45,"after, following the folding water you carry, that carries"
1869,45,"me away,  the night, the world, the wind spin out their destiny,"
1870,45,"without you, i am your dream, only that, and that is all,"
1871,46,"if your eyes were not the color of the moon,"
1872,46,"of a day full   [here, interrupted by the baby waking -- continued about 26"
1873,46,hours later ]
1874,46,"of a day full of clay, and work, and fire,"
1875,46,"if even held-in you did not move in agile grace like the air,"
1876,46,"if you were not an amber week,"
1877,46,
1878,46,not the yellow moment
1879,46,when autumn climbs up through the vines;
1880,46,if you were not that bread the fragrant moon
1881,46,"kneads, sprinkling its flour across the sky,"
1882,46,
1883,46,"oh, my dearest, i could not love you so!"
1884,46,but when i hold you i hold everything that is --
1885,46,"sand, time, the tree of the rain,"
1886,46,
1887,46,"everything is alive so that i can be alive,"
1888,46,"without moving i can see it all,"
1889,46,"in your life i see everything that lives,"
1890,47,"i crave your mouth, your voice, your hair,"
1891,47,"silent and starving, i prowl through the streets,"
1892,47,"bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day"
1893,47,"i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps,"
1894,47,
1895,47,"i hunger for your sleek laugh,"
1896,47,"your hands the color of a savage harvest,"
1897,47,"hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,"
1898,47,"i want to eat your skin like a whole almond,"
1899,47,
1900,47,"i want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,"
1901,47,"the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,"
1902,47,"i want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,"
1903,47,
1904,47,"and i pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,"
1905,47,"hunting for you, for your hot heart,"
1906,47,"like a puma in the barrens of quitratue,"
1907,48,"i do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,"
1908,48,"or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off,"
1909,48,"i love you as certain dark things are to be loved,"
1910,48,"in secret, between the shadow and the soul,"
1911,48,
1912,48,i love you as the plant that never blooms
1913,48,but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;
1914,48,"thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,"
1915,48,"risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body,"
1916,48,
1917,48,"i love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,"
1918,48,"i love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;"
1919,48,so i love you because i know no other way
1920,48,
1921,48,"than this, where i does not exist, nor you,"
1922,48,"so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,"
1923,48,"so close that your eyes close as i fall asleep,"
1924,49,"you are the daughter of the sea, oregano's first cousin,"
1925,49,"swimmer, your body is pure as the water;"
1926,49,"cook, your blood is quick as the soil,"
1927,49,"everything you do is full of flowers, rich with the earth,"
1928,49,
1929,49,"your eyes go out toward the water, and the waves rise;"
1930,49,your hands go out to the earth and the seeds swell;
1931,49,"you know the deep essence of water and the earth,"
1932,49,"conjoined in you like a formula for clay,"
1933,49,
1934,49,"naiad, cut your body into turquoise pieces,"
1935,49,"they will bloom resurrected in the kitchen,"
1936,49,"this is how you become everything that lives,"
1937,49,
1938,49,"and so at last, you sleep, in the circle of my arms"
1939,49,that push back the shadows so that you can rest--
1940,49,"vegetables, seaweed, herbs, the foam of your dreams,"
1941,50,"tell me, is the rose naked"
1942,50,"or is that her only dress?,"
1943,50,
1944,50,why do trees conceal
1945,50,"the splendor of their roots?,"
1946,50,
1947,50,who hears the regrets
1948,50,"of the thieving automobile?,"
1949,50,
1950,50,is there anything in the world sadder
1951,50,"than a train standing in the rain?,"
1952,51,"an odor has remained among the sugarcane,"
1953,51,"a mixture of blood and body, a penetrating"
1954,51,"petal that brings nausea,"
1955,51,between the coconut palms the graves are full
1956,51,"of ruined bones, of speechless death-rattles,"
1957,51,the delicate dictator is talking
1958,51,"with top hats, gold braid, and collars,"
1959,51,the tiny palace gleams like a watch
1960,51,and the rapid laughs with gloves on
1961,51,cross the corridors at times
1962,51,and join the dead voices
1963,51,"and the blue mouths freshly buried,"
1964,51,"the weeping cannot be seen, like a plant"
1965,51,"whose seeds fall endlessly on the earth,"
1966,51,"whose large blind leaves grow even without light,"
1967,51,"hatred has grown scale on scale,"
1968,51,"blow on blow, in the ghastly water of the swamp,"
1969,51,with a snout full of ooze and silence
1970,52,my eyes went away from me
1971,52,"following a dark girl who went by,"
1972,52,
1973,52,she was made of black motherofpearl
1974,52,"made of darkpurple grapes,"
1975,52,and she lashed my blood
1976,52,"with her tail of fire,"
1977,52,
1978,52,"after them all i go,"
1979,52,
1980,52,a pale blonde went by
1981,52,like a golden plant
1982,52,"swaying her gifts,"
1983,52,and my mouth went
1984,52,like a wave
1985,52,discharging on her breast
1986,52,"lightningbolts of blood,"
1987,52,
1988,52,"after them all i go,"
1989,52,
1990,52,"but to you, without my moving,"
1991,52,"without seeing you, distant you,"
1992,52,"go my blood and my kisses,"
1993,52,"my dark one and my fair one,"
1994,52,"my broad one and my slender one,"
1995,52,"my ugly one, my beauty,"
1996,52,made of all the gold
1997,52,"and of all the silver,"
1998,52,made of all the wheat
1999,52,"and of all the earth,"
2000,52,made of all the water
2001,52,"of sea waves,"
2002,52,made for my arms
2003,52,"made for my kisses,"
2004,52,"made for my soul,"
2005,53,"the light wraps you in its mortal flame,"
2006,53,"abstracted pale mourner, standing that way"
2007,53,against the old propellers of the twighlight
2008,53,"that revolves around you,"
2009,53,
2010,53,"speechless, my friend,"
2011,53,alone in the loneliness of this hour of the dead
2012,53,"and filled with the lives of fire,"
2013,53,"pure heir of the ruined day,"
2014,53,
2015,53,"a bough of fruit falls from the sun on your dark garment,"
2016,53,the great roots of night
2017,53,"grow suddenly from your soul,"
2018,53,and the things that hide in you come out again
2019,53,so that a blue and palled people
2020,53,"your newly born, takes nourishment,"
2021,53,
2022,53,oh magnificent and fecund and magnetic slave
2023,53,"of the circle that moves in turn through black and gold,"
2024,53,"rise, lead and possess a creation"
2025,53,so rich in life that its flowers perish
2026,53,"and it is full of sadness,"
2027,54,ancient night and the unruly salt
2028,54,"beat at the walls of my house,"
2029,54,"the shadow is all one, the sky"
2030,54,"throbs now along with the ocean,"
2031,54,and sky and shadow erupt
2032,54,"in the crash of their vast conflict,"
2033,54,all night long they struggle;
2034,54,nobody knows the name
2035,54,of the harsh light that keeps slowly opening
2036,54,"like a languid fruit,"
2037,54,"so on the coast comes to light,"
2038,54,"out of seething shadow, the harsh dawn,"
2039,54,"gnawed at by the moving salt,"
2040,54,"swept clean by the mass of night,"
2041,54,"bloodstained in its sea-washed crater,"
2042,55,to the solemn sea the old women come
2043,55,with their shawls knotted around their necks
2044,55,"with their fragile feet cracking,"
2045,55,
2046,55,they sit down alone on the shore
2047,55,without moving their eyes or their hands
2048,55,"without changing the clouds or the silence,"
2049,55,
2050,55,the obscene sea breaks and claws
2051,55,rushes downhill trumpeting
2052,55,"shakes its bull's beard,"
2053,55,
2054,55,the gentle old ladies seated
2055,55,as if in a transparent boat
2056,55,"they look at the terrorist waves,"
2057,55,
2058,55,where will they go and where have they been?
2059,55,they come from every corner
2060,55,"they come from our own lives,"
2061,55,
2062,55,now they have the ocean
2063,55,the cold and burning emptiness
2064,55,"the solitude full of flames,"
2065,55,
2066,55,they come from all the pasts
2067,55,from houses which were fragrant
2068,55,"from burnt-up evenings,"
2069,55,
2070,55,"they look, or don't look, at the sea"
2071,55,with their walking sticks they draw signs in the sand
2072,55,"and the sea erases their calligraphy,"
2073,55,
2074,55,the old women get up and go away
2075,55,with their fragile bird feet
2076,55,while the waves flood in
2077,55,"traveling naked in the wind,"
2078,56,"i have named you queen,"
2079,56,"there are taller than you, taller,"
2080,56,"there are purer than you, purer,"
2081,56,"there are lovelier than you, lovelier,"
2082,56,"but you are the queen,"
2083,56,
2084,56,when you go through the streets
2085,56,"no one recognizes you,"
2086,56,"no one sees your crystal crown, no one looks"
2087,56,at the carpet of red gold
2088,56,"that you tread as you pass,"
2089,56,"the nonexistent carpet,"
2090,56,
2091,56,and when you appear
2092,56,all the rivers sound
2093,56,"in my body, bells"
2094,56,"shake the sky,"
2095,56,"and a hymn fills the world,"
2096,56,
2097,56,"only you and i,"
2098,56,"only you and i, my love,"
2099,56,"listen to me,"
2100,57,"love, a question"
2101,57,"has destroyed you,"
2102,57,
2103,57,i have come back to you
2104,57,"from thorny uncertainty,"
2105,57,
2106,57,i want you straight as
2107,57,"the sword or the road,"
2108,57,
2109,57,but you insist
2110,57,on keeping a nook
2111,57,"of shadow that i do not want,"
2112,57,
2113,57,"my love,"
2114,57,"understand me,"
2115,57,"i love all of you,"
2116,57,"from eyes to feet, to toenails,"
2117,57,"inside,"
2118,57,"all the brightness, which you kept,"
2119,57,
2120,57,"it is i, my love,"
2121,57,"who knocks at your door,"
2122,57,"it is not the ghost, it is not"
2123,57,the one who once stopped
2124,57,"at your window,"
2125,57,"i knock down the door,"
2126,57,"i enter your life,"
2127,57,"i come to live in your soul,"
2128,57,"you cannot cope with me,"
2129,57,
2130,57,"you must open door to door,"
2131,57,"you must obey me,"
2132,57,you must open your eyes
2133,57,"so that i may search in them,"
2134,57,you must see how i walk
2135,57,with heavy steps
2136,57,along all the roads
2137,57,"that, blind, were waiting for me,"
2138,57,
2139,57,"do not fear,"
2140,57,"i am yours,"
2141,57,but
2142,57,"i am not the passenger or the beggar,"
2143,57,"i am your master,"
2144,57,"the one you were waiting for,"
2145,57,and now i enter
2146,57,"your life,"
2147,57,"no more to leave it,"
2148,57,"love, love, love,"
2149,57,"but to stay,"
2150,58,"you swallowed everything, like distance,"
2151,58,"like the sea, like time,"
2152,58,in you everything sank!
2153,58,"it was the happy hour of assault and the kiss,"
2154,58,"the hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse,"
2155,58,"pilot's dread, fury of a blind diver,"
2156,58,"turbulent drunkenness of love,"
2157,58,in you everything sank!
2158,59,"the weary one, orphan"
2159,59,"of the masses, the self,"
2160,59,"the crushed one, the one made of concrete,"
2161,59,"the one without a country in crowded restaurants,"
2162,59,"he who wanted to go far away, always farther away,"
2163,59,"didn't know what to do there, whether he wanted"
2164,59,"or didn't want to leave or remain on the island,"
2165,59,"the hesitant one, the hybrid, entangled in himself,"
2166,59,"had no place here, the straight-angled stone,"
2167,59,"the infinite look of the granite prism,"
2168,59,"the circular solitude all banished him,"
2169,59,"he went somewhere else with his sorrows,"
2170,59,"he returned to the agony of his native land,"
2171,59,"to his indecisions, of winter and summer,"
2172,60,"lost in the forest, i broke off a dark twig"
2173,60,"and lifted its whisper to my thirsty lips,"
2174,60,"maybe it was the voice of the rain crying,"
2175,60,"a cracked bell, or a torn heart,"
2176,60,
2177,60,something from far off it seemed
2178,60,"deep and secret to me, hidden by the earth,"
2179,60,"a shout muffled by huge autumns,"
2180,60,"by the moist half-open darkness of the leaves,"
2181,60,
2182,60,"wakening from the dreaming forest there, the hazel-sprig"
2183,60,"sang under my tongue, its drifting fragrance"
2184,60,climbed up through my conscious mind
2185,60,
2186,60,as if suddenly the roots i had left behind
2187,60,"cried out to me, the land i had lost with my childhood---"
2188,60,"and i stopped, wounded by the wandering scent"
2189,61,"i can write the saddest poem of all tonight,"
2190,61,
2191,61,"write, for instance, the night is full of stars,"
2192,61,"and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance,"
2193,61,
2194,61,"the night wind whirls in the sky and sings,"
2195,61,
2196,61,"i can write the saddest poem of all tonight,"
2197,61,"i loved her, and sometimes she loved me too,"
2198,61,
2199,61,"on nights like this, i held her in my arms,"
2200,61,"i kissed her so many times under the infinite sky,"
2201,61,
2202,61,"she loved me, sometimes i loved her,"
2203,61,"how could i not have loved her large, still eyes?"
2204,61,
2205,61,"i can write the saddest poem of all tonight,"
2206,61,"to think i don't have her, to feel that i've lost her,"
2207,61,
2208,61,"to hear the immense night, more immense without her,"
2209,61,"and the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass,"
2210,61,
2211,61,"what does it matter that my love couldn't keep her,"
2212,61,"the night is full of stars and she is not with me,"
2213,61,
2214,61,"that's all, far away, someone sings, far away,"
2215,61,"my soul is lost without her,"
2216,61,
2217,61,"as if to bring her near, my eyes search for her,"
2218,61,"my heart searches for her and she is not with me,"
2219,61,
2220,61,"the same night that whitens the same trees,"
2221,61,"we, we who were, we are the same no longer,"
2222,61,
2223,61,"i no longer love her, true, but how much i loved her,"
2224,61,"my voice searched the wind to touch her ear,"
2225,61,
2226,61,"someone else's, she will be someone else's, as she once"
2227,61,"belonged to my kisses,"
2228,61,"her voice, her light body, her infinite eyes,"
2229,61,
2230,61,"i no longer love her, true, but perhaps i love her,"
2231,61,"love is so short and oblivion so long,"
2232,61,
2233,61,"because on nights like this i held her in my arms,"
2234,61,"my soul is lost without her,"
2235,61,
2236,61,"although this may be the last pain she causes me,"
2237,61,"and this may be the last poem i write for her,"
2238,62,"o tower of light, sad beauty"
2239,62,"that magnified necklaces and statues in the sea,"
2240,62,"calcareous eye, insignia of the vast waters, cry"
2241,62,"of the mourning petrel, tooth of the sea, wife"
2242,62,"of the oceanian wind, o separate rose"
2243,62,from the long stem of the trampled bush
2244,62,"that the depths, converted into archipelago,"
2245,62,"o natural star, green diadem,"
2246,62,"alone in your lonesome dynasty,"
2247,62,"still unattainable, elusive, desolate"
2248,62,"like one drop, like one grape, like the sea,"
2249,63,three triangles of birds crossed  
2250,63,over the enormous ocean which extended  
2251,63,"in winter like a green beast,  "
2252,63,"everything just lay there, the silence,  "
2253,63,"the unfolding gray, the heavy light  "
2254,63,"of space, some land now and then,  "
2255,63,over everything there was passing  
2256,63,a flight  
2257,63,and another flight  
2258,63,"of dark birds, winter bodies  "
2259,63,trembling triangles  
2260,63,"whose wings,  "
2261,63,"frantically flapping, hardly  "
2262,63,"can carry the gray cold, the desolate days  "
2263,63,from one place to another  
2264,63,"along the coast of chile,  "
2265,63,i am here while from one sky to another  
2266,63,the trembling of the migratory birds  
2267,63,"leaves me sunk inside myself, inside my own matter  "
2268,63,like an everlasting well  
2269,63,"dug by an immovable spiral,  "
2270,63,now they have disappeared  
2271,63,black feathers of the sea  
2272,63,iron birds  
2273,63,from steep slopes and rock piles  
2274,63,now at noon  
2275,63,"i am in front of emptiness, it’s a winter  "
2276,63,space stretched out  
2277,63,and the sea has put  
2278,63,over its blue face  
2279,63,"a bitter mask,"
2280,64,"it so happens i am sick of being a man,"
2281,64,and it happens that i walk into tailorshops and movie
2282,64,    houses
2283,64,"dried up, waterproof, like a swan made of felt"
2284,64,"steering my way in a water of wombs and ashes,"
2285,64,
2286,64,the smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse
2287,64,"    sobs,"
2288,64,"the only thing i want is to lie still like stones or wool,"
2289,64,"the only thing i want is to see no more stores, no gardens,"
2290,64,"no more goods, no spectacles, no elevators,"
2291,64,
2292,64,it so happens that i am sick of my feet and my nails
2293,64,"and my hair and my shadow,"
2294,64,"it so happens i am sick of being a man,"
2295,64,
2296,64,still it would be marvelous
2297,64,"to terrify a law clerk with a cut lily,"
2298,64,"or kill a nun with a blow on the ear,"
2299,64,it would be great
2300,64,to go through the streets with a green knife
2301,64,"letting out yells until i died of the cold,"
2302,64,
2303,64,"i don't want to go on being a root in the dark,"
2304,64,"insecure, stretched out, shivering with sleep,"
2305,64,"going on down, into the moist guts of the earth,"
2306,64,"taking in and thinking, eating every day,"
2307,64,
2308,64,"i don't want so much misery,"
2309,64,"i don't want to go on as a root and a tomb,"
2310,64,"alone under the ground, a warehouse with corpses,"
2311,64,"half frozen, dying of grief,"
2312,64,
2313,64,"that's why monday, when it sees me coming"
2314,64,"with my convict face, blazes up like gasoline,"
2315,64,"and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel,"
2316,64,and leaves tracks full of warm blood leading toward the
2317,64,"    night,"
2318,64,
2319,64,"and it pushes me into certain corners, into some moist"
2320,64,"    houses,"
2321,64,"into hospitals where the bones fly out the window,"
2322,64,"into shoeshops that smell like vinegar,"
2323,64,"and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin,"
2324,64,
2325,64,"there are sulphur-colored birds, and hideous intestines"
2326,64,"hanging over the doors of houses that i hate,"
2327,64,"and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot,"
2328,64,there are mirrors
2329,64,"that ought to have wept from shame and terror,"
2330,64,"there are umbrellas everywhere, and venoms, and umbilical"
2331,64,"    cords,"
2332,64,
2333,64,"i stroll along serenely, with my eyes, my shoes,"
2334,64,"my rage, forgetting everything,"
2335,64,"i walk by, going through office buildings and orthopedic"
2336,64,"    shops,"
2337,64,"and courtyards with washing hanging from the line,"
2338,64,"underwear, towels and shirts from which slow"
2339,64,"dirty tears are falling,"
2340,65,"everything on the earth bristled, the bramble"
2341,65,pricked and the green thread
2342,65,"nibbled away, the petal fell, falling"
2343,65,"until the only flower was the falling itself,"
2344,65,"water is another matter,"
2345,65,"has no direction but its own bright grace,"
2346,65,"runs through all imaginable colors,"
2347,65,takes limpid lessons
2348,65,"from stone,"
2349,65,and in those functionings plays out
2350,65,"the unrealized ambitions of the foam,"
2351,66,"of the many men whom i am, whom we are,"
2352,66,"i cannot settle on a single one,"
2353,66,they are lost to me under the cover of clothing
2354,66,"they have departed for another city,"
2355,66,
2356,66,when everything seems to be set
2357,66,"to show me off as a man of intelligence,"
2358,66,the fool i keep concealed on my person
2359,66,"takes over my talk and occupies my mouth,"
2360,66,
2361,66,"on other occasions, i am dozing in the midst"
2362,66,"of people of some distinction,"
2363,66,"and when i summon my courageous self,"
2364,66,a coward completely unknown to me
2365,66,swaddles my poor skeleton
2366,66,"in a thousand tiny reservations,"
2367,66,
2368,66,"when a stately home bursts into flames,"
2369,66,"instead of the fireman i summon,"
2370,66,"an arsonist bursts on the scene,"
2371,66,"and he is i, there is nothing i can do,"
2372,66,what must i do to distinguish myself?
2373,66,how can i put myself together?
2374,66,
2375,66,all the books i read
2376,66,"lionize dazzling hero figures,"
2377,66,"brimming with self-assurance,"
2378,66,i die with envy of them;
2379,66,"and, in films where bullets fly on the wind,"
2380,66,"i am left in envy of the cowboys,"
2381,66,"left admiring even the horses,"
2382,66,
2383,66,"but when i call upon my dashing being,"
2384,66,"out comes the same old lazy self,"
2385,66,"and so i never know just who i am,"
2386,66,"nor how many i am, nor who we will be being,"
2387,66,i would like to be able to touch a bell
2388,66,"and call up my real self, the truly me,"
2389,66,"because if i really need my proper self,"
2390,66,"i must not allow myself to disappear,"
2391,66,
2392,66,"while i am writing, i am far away;"
2393,66,"and when i come back, i have already left,"
2394,66,i should like to see if the same thing happens
2395,66,"to other people as it does to me,"
2396,66,"to see if as many people are as i am,"
2397,66,"and if they seem the same way to themselves,"
2398,66,"when this problem has been thoroughly explored,"
2399,66,i am going to school myself so well in things
2400,66,"that, when i try to explain my problems,"
2401,66,"i shall speak, not of self, but of geography,"
2402,67,"spain was a taut, dry drum-head"
2403,67,daily beating a dull thud
2404,67,flatlands and eagle's nest
2405,67,"silence lashed by the storm,"
2406,67,"how much, to the point of weeping, in my soul"
2407,67,"i love your hard soil, your poor bread,"
2408,67,"your poor people, how much in the deep place"
2409,67,of my being there is still the lost flower
2410,67,"of your wrinkled villages, motionless in time"
2411,67,and your metallic meadows
2412,67,"stretched out in the moonlight through the ages,"
2413,67,"now devoured by a false god,"
2414,67,
2415,67,"all your confinement, your animal isolation"
2416,67,while you are still conscious
2417,67,"surrounded by the abstract stones of silence,"
2418,67,"your rough wine, your smooth wine"
2419,67,"your violent and dangerous vineyards,"
2420,67,
2421,67,"solar stone, pure among the regions"
2422,67,"of the world, spain streaked"
2423,67,"with blood and metal, blue and victorious"
2424,67,"proletarian spain, made of petals and bullets"
2425,67,"unique, alive, asleep - resounding,"
2426,68,when i cannot look at your face
2427,68,"i look at your feet,"
2428,68,"your feet of arched bone,"
2429,68,"your hard little feet,"
2430,68,"i know that they support you,"
2431,68,and that your sweet weight
2432,68,"rises upon them,"
2433,68,"your waist and your breasts,"
2434,68,the doubled purple
2435,68,"of your nipples,"
2436,68,the sockets of your eyes
2437,68,"that have just flown away,"
2438,68,"your wide fruit mouth,"
2439,68,"your red tresses,"
2440,68,"my little tower,"
2441,68,but i love your feet
2442,68,only because they walked
2443,68,upon the earth and upon
2444,68,"the wind and upon the waters,"
2445,68,"until they found me,"
2446,69,"take bread away from me, if you wish,"
2447,69,"take air away, but"
2448,69,"do not take from me your laughter,"
2449,69,
2450,69,"do not take away the rose,"
2451,69,"the lance flower that you pluck,"
2452,69,the water that suddenly
2453,69,"bursts forth in joy,"
2454,69,the sudden wave
2455,69,"of silver born in you,"
2456,69,
2457,69,my struggle is harsh and i come back
2458,69,with eyes tired
2459,69,at times from having seen
2460,69,"the unchanging earth,"
2461,69,but when your laughter enters
2462,69,it rises to the sky seeking me
2463,69,and it opens for me all
2464,69,"the doors of life,"
2465,69,
2466,69,"my love, in the darkest"
2467,69,hour your laughter
2468,69,"opens, and if suddenly"
2469,69,you see my blood staining
2470,69,"the stones of the street,"
2471,69,"laugh, because your laughter"
2472,69,will be for my hands
2473,69,"like a fresh sword,"
2474,69,
2475,69,"next to the sea in the autumn,"
2476,69,your laughter must raise
2477,69,"its foamy cascade,"
2478,69,"and in the spring, love,"
2479,69,i want your laughter like
2480,69,"the flower i was waiting for,"
2481,69,"the blue flower, the rose"
2482,69,"of my echoing country,"
2483,69,
2484,69,"laugh at the night,"
2485,69,"at the day, at the moon,"
2486,69,laugh at the twisted
2487,69,"streets of the island,"
2488,69,laugh at this clumsy
2489,69,"boy who loves you,"
2490,69,but when i open
2491,69,"my eyes and close them,"
2492,69,"when my steps go,"
2493,69,"when my steps return,"
2494,69,"deny me bread, air,"
2495,69,"light, spring,"
2496,69,but never your laughter
2497,69,"for i would die,"
