126,4,and i had idly poised my pen in air
127,4,to stop it with a period of ink
128,4,"when something strange about it made me think,"
129,4,"this was no dust speck by my breathing blown,"
130,4,but unmistakably a living mite
131,4,"with inclinations it could call its own,"
132,4,"it paused as with suspicion of my pen,"
133,4,and then came racing wildly on again
134,4,to where my manuscript was not yet dry;
135,4,then paused again and either drank or smelt--
136,4,"with loathing, for again it turned to fly,"
137,4,"plainly with an intelligence i dealt,"

140,4,"to express how much it didn't want to die,"
141,4,"it ran with terror and with cunning crept,"
142,4,"it faltered, i could see it hesitate;"
143,4,then in the middle of the open sheet
144,4,cower down in desperation to accept
145,4,"whatever i accorded it of fate,"

147,4,collectivistic regimenting love
148,4,"with which the modern world is being swept,"

150,4,since it was nothing i knew evil of
151,4,"i let it lie there till i hope it slept,"
152,4,
153,4,i have a mind myself and recognize
154,4,mind when i meet with it in any guise
155,4,no one can know how glad i am to find
156,4,"on any sheet the least display of mind,"
157,5,"i had withdrawn in forest, and my song"
158,5,was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;
159,5,and to the forest edge you came one day
160,5,"this was my dream and looked and pondered long,"
161,5,"but did not enter, though the wish was strong,"
162,5,"you shook your pensive head as who should say,"
163,5,‘i dare not--too far in his footsteps stray--

165,5,
166,5,"not far, but near, i stood and saw it all"
167,5,behind low boughs the trees let down outside;
168,5,and the sweet pang it cost me not to call
169,5,"and tell you that i saw does still abide,"
170,5,"but 'tis not true that thus i dwelt aloof,"
171,5,"for the wood wakes, and you are here for proof,"
172,6,"when i go up through the mowing field,"
173,6,"the headless aftermath,"
174,6,"   smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,"
175,6," half closes the garden path,"
176,6,
177,6,"   and when i come to the garden ground,"
178,6,the whir of sober birds
179,6, up from the tangle of withered weeds
180,6, is sadder than any words
181,6,
182,6,"a tree beside the wall stands bare,"
183,6," but a leaf that lingered brown,"
184,6,"   disturbed, i doubt not, by my thought,"
185,6," comes softly rattling down,"
186,6,
187,6, i end not far from my going forth
188,6,   by picking the faded blue
189,6,of the last remaining aster flower
190,6," to carry again to you,"
191,7,"the line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift,"
192,7," the road is forlorn all day,"
193,7,"where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,"
194,7," and the hoof-prints vanish away,"
195,7,"the roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,"
196,7," expend their bloom in vain,"
197,7,"come over the hills and far with me,"
198,7," and be my love in the rain,"
199,7,
200,7,the birds have less to say for themselves
201,7, in the wood-world's torn despair
202,7,"than now these numberless years the elves,"
203,7," although they are no less there,"
204,7,all song of the woods is crushed like some
205,7," wild, earily shattered rose,"
206,7,"come, be my love in the wet woods, come,"
207,7," where the boughs rain when it blows,"
208,7,
209,7,there is the gale to urge behind
210,7," and bruit our singing down,"
211,7,and the shallow waters aflutter with wind
212,7," from which to gather your gown,"
213,7,"what matter if we go clear to the west,"
214,7, and come not through dry-shod?
215,7,for wilding brooch shall wet your breast
216,7," the rain-fresh goldenrod,"
217,7,
218,7,"oh, never this whelming east wind swells"
219,7, but it seems like the sea's return
220,7,to the ancient lands where it left the shells
221,7, before the age of the fern;
222,7,and it seems like the time when after doubt
223,7," our love came back amain,"
224,7,"oh, come forth into the storm and rout"
225,7," and be my love in the rain,"
226,8,"i have wished a bird would fly away,"
227,8,and not sing by my house all day;
228,8,
229,8,have clapped my hands at him from the door
230,8,"when it seemed as if i could bear no more,"
231,8,
232,8,"the fault must partly have been in me,"
233,8,"the bird was not to blame for his key,"
234,8,
235,8,and of course there must be something wrong
236,8,"in wanting to silence any song,"
237,9,there's a patch of old snow in a corner
238,9,that i should have guessed
239,9,was a blow-away paper the rain
240,9,"had brought to rest,"
241,9,
242,9,it is speckled with grime as if
243,9,"small print overspread it,"
244,9,the news of a day i've forgotten --
245,9,"if i ever read it,"
246,10,"oh, give us pleasure in the flowers today;"
247,10,and give us not to think so far away
248,10,as the uncertain harvest; keep us here
249,10,"all simply in the springing of the year,"
250,10,
251,10,"oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,"
252,10,"like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;"
253,10,"and make us happy in the happy bees,"
254,10,"the swarm dilating round the perfect trees,"
255,10,
256,10,and make us happy in the darting bird
257,10,"that suddenly above the bees is heard,"
258,10,"the meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,"
259,10,"and off a blossom in mid air stands still,"
260,10,
261,10,"for this is love and nothing else is love,"
262,10,to which it is reserved for god above
263,10,"to sanctify to what far ends he will,"
264,10,"but which it only needs that we fulfill,"
265,11,"a voice said, look me in the stars"
266,11,"and tell me truly, men of earth,"
267,11,if all the soul-and-body scars
268,11,"were not too much to pay for birth,"
269,12,i didn't make you know how glad i was
270,12,"to have you come and camp here on our land,"
271,12,i promised myself to get down some day
272,12,"and see the way you lived, but i don't know!"
273,12,with a houseful of hungry men to feed
274,12,"i guess you'd find,, it seems to me"
275,12,i can't express my feelings any more
276,12,than i can raise my voice or want to lift
277,12,"my hand oh, i can lift it when i have to,"
278,12,"did ever you feel so? i hope you never,"
279,12,it's got so i don't even know for sure
280,12,"whether i am glad, sorry, or anything,"
281,12,there's nothing but a voice-like left inside
282,12,"that seems to tell me how i ought to feel,"
283,12,"and would feel if i wasn't all gone wrong,"
284,12,"you take the lake, i look and look at it,"
285,12,"i see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,"
286,12,i stand and make myself repeat out loud
287,12,"the advantages it has, so long and narrow,"
288,12,like a deep piece of some old running river
289,12,"cut short off at both ends, it lies five miles"
290,12,straight away through the mountain notch
291,12,"from the sink window where i wash the plates,"
292,12,"and all our storms come up toward the house,"
293,12,"drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter,"
294,12,it took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
295,12,to step outdoors and take the water dazzle
296,12,"a sunny morning, or take the rising wind"
297,12,"about my face and body and through my wrapper,"
298,12,"when a storm threatened from the dragon's den,"
299,12,"and a cold chill shivered across the lake,"
300,12,"i see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,"
301,12,our willoughby! how did you hear of it?
302,12,"i expect, though, everyone's heard of it,"
303,12,in a book about ferns? listen to that!
304,12,you let things more like feathers regulate
305,12,"your going and coming, and you like it here?"
306,12,"i can see how you might, but i don't know!"
307,12,"it would be different if more people came,"
308,12,"for then there would be business, as it is,"
309,12,"the cottages len built, sometimes we rent them,"
310,12,"sometimes we don't, we've a good piece of shore"
311,12,"that ought to be worth something, and may yet,"
312,12,"but i don't count on it as much as len,"
313,12,"he looks on the bright side of everything,"
314,12,"including me, he thinks i'll be all right"
315,12,"with doctoring, but it's not medicine--"
316,12,lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so--
317,12,"it's rest i want--there, i have said it out--"
318,12,from cooking meals for hungry hired men
319,12,and washing dishes after them--from doing
320,12,"things over and over that just won't stay done,"
321,12,by good rights i ought not to have so much
322,12,"put on me, but there seems no other way,"
323,12,"len says one steady pull more ought to do it,"
324,12,"he says the best way out is always through,"
325,12,"and i agree to that, or in so far"
326,12,as that i can see no way out but through--
327,12,"leastways for me--and then they'll be convinced,"
328,12,"it's not that len don't want the best for me,"
329,12,it was his plan our moving over in
330,12,beside the lake from where that day i showed you
331,12,"we used to live--ten miles from anywhere,"
332,12,"we didn't change without some sacrifice,"
333,12,"but len went at it to make up the loss,"
334,12,"his work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,"
335,12,but he works when he works as hard as i do--
336,12,"though there's small profit in comparisons,"
337,12,"women and men will make them all the same,"
338,12,"but work ain't all, len undertakes too much,"
339,12,"he's into everything in town, this year"
340,12,"it's highways, and he's got too many men"
341,12,"around him to look after that make waste,"
342,12,"they take advantage of him shamefully,"
343,12,"and proud, too, of themselves for doing so,"
344,12,"we have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,"
345,12,sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
346,12,"while i fry their bacon, much they care!"
347,12,no more put out in what they do or say
348,12,"than if i wasn't in the room at all,"
349,12,"coming and going all the time, they are,"
350,12,"i don't learn what their names are, let alone"
351,12,"their characters, or whether they are safe"
352,12,"to have inside the house with doors unlocked,"
353,12,"i'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not"
354,12,"afraid of me, there's two can play at that,"
355,12,"i have my fancies, it runs in the family,"
356,12,"my father's brother wasn't right, they kept him"
357,12,"locked up for years back there at the old farm,"
358,12,"i've been away once--yes, i've been away,"
359,12,"the state asylum, i was prejudiced;"
360,12,i wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;
361,12,you know the old idea--the only asylum
362,12,"was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,"
363,12,"rather than send their folks to such a place,"
364,12,"kept them at home; and it does seem more human,"
365,12,"but it's not so, the place is the asylum,"
366,12,"there they have every means proper to do with,"
367,12,and you aren't darkening other people's lives--
368,12,"worse than no good to them, and they no good"
369,12,to you in your condition; you can't know
370,12,"affection or the want of it in that state,"
371,12,"i've heard too much of the old-fashioned way,"
372,12,"my father's brother, he went mad quite young,"
373,12,"some thought he had been bitten by a dog,"
374,12,because his violence took on the form
375,12,of carrying his pillow in his teeth;
376,12,"but it's more likely he was crossed in love,"
377,12,"or so the story goes, it was some girl,"
378,12,"anyway all he talked about was love,"
379,12,they soon saw he would do someone a mischief
380,12,"if he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended"
381,12,"in father's building him a sort of cage,"
382,12,"or room within a room, of hickory poles,"
383,12,"like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,--"
384,12,"a narrow passage all the way around,"
385,12,anything they put in for furniture
386,12,"he'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on,"
387,12,"so they made the place comfortable with straw,"
388,12,"like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences,"
389,12,"of course they had to feed him without dishes,"
390,12,"they tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded"
391,12,"with his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes,"
392,12,"cruel--it sounds, i 'spose they did the best"
393,12,"they knew, and just when he was at the height,"
394,12,"father and mother married, and mother came,"
395,12,"a bride, to help take care of such a creature,"
396,12,"and accommodate her young life to his,"
397,12,"that was what marrying father meant to her,"
398,12,she had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
399,12,"by his shouts in the night, he'd shout and shout"
400,12,"until the strength was shouted out of him,"
401,12,"and his voice died down slowly from exhaustion,"
402,12,"he'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,"
403,12,and let them go and make them twang until
404,12,"his hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow,"
405,12,and then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play--
406,12,"the only fun he had, i've heard them say, though,"
407,12,"they found a way to put a stop to it,"
408,12,he was before my time--i never saw him;
409,12,but the pen stayed exactly as it was
410,12,"there in the upper chamber in the ell,"
411,12,"a sort of catch-all full of attic clutter,"
412,12,"i often think of the smooth hickory bars,"
413,12,"it got so i would say--you know, half fooling--"
414,12,it's time i took my turn upstairs in jail--
415,12,"just as you will till it becomes a habit,"
416,12,"no wonder i was glad to get away,"
417,12,"mind you, i waited till len said the word,"
418,12,"i didn't want the blame if things went wrong,"
419,12,"i was glad though, no end, when we moved out,"
420,12,"and i looked to be happy, and i was,"
421,12,"as i said, for a while--but i don't know!"
422,12,"somehow the change wore out like a prescription,"
423,12,and there's more to it than just window-views
424,12,"and living by a lake, i'm past such help--"
425,12,"unless len took the notion, which he won't,"
426,12,"and i won't ask him--it's not sure enough,"
427,12,"i 'spose i've got to go the road i'm going,"
428,12,"other folks have to, and why shouldn't i?"
429,12,"i almost think if i could do like you,"
430,12,drop everything and live out on the ground--
431,12,"but it might be, come night, i shouldn't like it,"
432,12,"or a long rain, i should soon get enough,"
433,12,"and be glad of a good roof overhead,"
434,12,"i've lain awake thinking of you, i'll warrant,"
435,12,"more than you have yourself, some of these nights,"
436,12,the wonder was the tents weren't snatched away
437,12,"from over you as you lay in your beds,"
438,12,"i haven't courage for a risk like that,"
439,12,"bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,"
440,12,"but the thing of it is, i need to be kept,"
441,12,there's work enough to do--there's always that;
442,12,"but behind's behind, the worst that you can do"
443,12,"is set me back a little more behind,"
444,12,"i sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway,"
445,12,"i'd rather you'd not go unless you must,"
446,13,"he is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,"
447,13,"that lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,"
448,13,"but still lies pointed as it plowed the dust,"
449,13,"if we who sight along it round the world,"
450,13,"see nothing worthy to have been its mark,"
451,13,"it is because like men we look too near,"
452,13,"forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,"
453,13,"our missiles always make too short an arc,"
454,13,"they fall, they rip the grass, they intersect"
455,13,"the curve of earth, and striking, break their own;"
456,13,"they make us cringe for metal-point on stone,"
457,13,"but this we know, the obstacle that checked"
458,13,"and tripped the body, shot the spirit on"
459,13,"further than target ever showed or shone,"
460,14,when a friend calls to me from the road
461,14,"and slows his horse to a meaning walk,"
462,14,i don't stand still and look around
463,14,"on all the hills i haven't hoed,"
464,14,"and shout from where i am, what is it?"
465,14,"no, not as there is a time to talk,"
466,14,"i thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,"
467,14,"blade-end up and five feet tall,"
468,14,"and plod, i go up to the stone wall"
469,14,"for a friendly visit,"
470,15,"i have been one acquainted with the night,"
471,15,"i have walked out in rain -- and back in rain,"
472,15,"i have outwalked the furthest city light,"
473,15,
474,15,"i have looked down the saddest city lane,"
475,15,i have passed by the watchman on his beat
476,15,"and dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain,"
477,15,
478,15,i have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
479,15,when far away an interrupted cry
480,15,"came over houses from another street,"
481,15,
482,15,but not to call me back or say good-bye;
483,15,"and further still at an unearthly height,"
484,15,a luminary clock against the sky
485,15,
486,15,"proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right,"
487,15,"i have been one acquainted with the night,"
488,16,my long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
489,16,"toward heaven still,"
490,16,and there's a barrel that i didn't fill
491,16,"beside it, and there may be two or three"
492,16,"apples i didn't pick upon some bough,"
493,16,"but i am done with apple-picking now,"
494,16,"essence of winter sleep is on the night,"
495,16,"the scent of apples, i am drowsing off,"
496,16,i cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
497,16,i got from looking through a pane of glass
498,16,i skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
499,16,"and held against the world of hoary grass,"
500,16,"it melted, and i let it fall and break,"
501,16,but i was well
502,16,"upon my way to sleep before it fell,"
503,16,and i could tell
504,16,"what form my dreaming was about to take,"
505,16,"magnified apples appear and disappear,"
506,16,"stem end and blossom end,"
507,16,"and every fleck of russet showing clear,"
508,16,"my instep arch not only keeps the ache,"
509,16,"it keeps the pressure of a ladder-round,"
510,16,"i feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend,"
511,16,and i keep hearing from the cellar bin
512,16,the rumbling sound
513,16,"of load on load of apples coming in,"
514,16,for i have had too much
515,16,"of apple-picking, i am overtired"
516,16,"of the great harvest i myself desired,"
517,16,"there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,"
518,16,"cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall,"
519,16,for all
520,16,"that struck the earth,"
521,16,"no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,"
522,16,went surely to the cider-apple heap
523,16,"as of no worth,"
524,16,one can see what will trouble
525,16,"this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is,"
526,16,"were he not gone,"
527,16,the woodchuck could say whether it's like his
528,16,"long sleep, as i describe its coming on,"
529,16,"or just some human sleep,"
530,17,all out of doors looked darkly in at him
531,17,"through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,"
532,17,"that gathers on the pane in empty rooms,"
533,17,what kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
534,17,"was the lamp tilted near them in his hand,"
535,17,what kept him from remembering what it was
536,17,"that brought him to that creaking room was age,"
537,17,"he stood with barrels round him -- at a loss,"
538,17,and having scared the cellar under him
539,17,"in clomping there, he scared it once again"
540,17,"in clomping off; -- and scared the outer night,"
541,17,"which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar"
542,17,"of trees and crack of branches, common things,"
543,17,"but nothing so like beating on a box,"
544,17,a light he was to no one but himself
545,17,"where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,"
546,17,"a quiet light, and then not even that,"
547,17,"he consigned to the moon, such as she was,"
548,17,"so late-arising, to the broken moon"
549,17,as better than the sun in any case
550,17,"for such a charge, his snow upon the roof,"
551,17,his icicles along the wall to keep;
552,17,"and slept, the log that shifted with a jolt"
553,17,"once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,"
554,17,"and eased his heavy breathing, but still slept,"
555,17,"one aged man -- one man -- can't keep a house,"
556,17,"a farm, a countryside, or if he can,"
557,17,"it's thus he does it of a winter night,"
558,18,"a house that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master,"
559,18,"with doors that none but the wind ever closes,"
560,18,its floor all littered with glass and with plaster;
561,18,"it stands in a garden of old-fashioned roses,"
562,18,
563,18,i pass by that way in the gloaming with mary;
564,18,"'i wonder,' i say, 'who the owner of those is,'"
565,18,"'oh, no one you know,' she answers me airy,"
566,18,"'but one we must ask if we want any roses,'"
567,18,
568,18,so we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
569,18,"there in the hush of the wood that reposes,"
570,18,"and turn and go up to the open door boldly,"
571,18,"and knock to the echoes as beggars for roses,"
572,18,
573,18,"'pray, are you within there, mistress who-were-you?'"
574,18,"'tis mary that speaks and our errand discloses,"
575,18,"'pray, are you within there? bestir you, bestir you!"
576,18,"'tis summer again; there's two come for roses,"
577,18,
578,18,"'a word with you, that of the singer recalling--"
579,18,"old herrick, a saying that every maid knows is"
580,18,"a flower unplucked is but left to the falling,"
581,18,"and nothing is gained by not gathering roses,'"
582,18,
583,18,we do not loosen our hands' intertwining
584,18,"not caring so very much what she supposes,"
585,18,there when she comes on us mistily shining
586,18,"and grants us by silence the boon of her roses,"
587,19,where had i heard this wind before
588,19,change like this to a deeper roar?
589,19,"what would it take my standing there for,"
590,19,"holding open a restive door,"
591,19,looking down hill to a frothy shore?
592,19,"summer was past and the day was past,"
593,19,"sombre clouds in the west were massed,"
594,19,"out on the porch's sagging floor,"
595,19,"leaves got up in a coil and hissed,"
596,19,"blindly striking at my knee and missed,"
597,19,something sinister in the tone
598,19,"told me my secret my be known,"
599,19,word i was in the house alone
600,19,"somehow must have gotten abroad,"
601,19,"word i was in my life alone,"
602,19,"word i had no one left but god,"
603,20,when i see birches bend to left and right
604,20,"across the lines of straighter darker trees,"
605,20,"i like to think some boy's been swinging them,"
606,20,"but swinging doesn't bend them down to stay,"
607,20,"ice-storms do that, often you must have seen them"
608,20,loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
609,20,"after a rain, they click upon themselves"
610,20,"as the breeze rises, and turn many-colored"
611,20,"as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel,"
612,20,soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
613,20,shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust--
614,20,such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
615,20,"you'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen,"
616,20,"they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,"
617,20,and they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
618,20,"so low for long, they never right themselves,"
619,20,you may see their trunks arching in the woods
620,20,"years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground"
621,20,like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
622,20,"before them over their heads to dry in the sun,"
623,20,but i was going to say when truth broke in
624,20,with all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
625,20,now am i free to be poetical?
626,20,i should prefer to have some boy bend them
627,20,as he went out and in to fetch the cows--
628,20,"some boy too far from town to learn baseball,"
629,20,"whose only play was what he found himself,"
630,20,"summer or winter, and could play alone,"
631,20,one by one he subdued his father's trees
632,20,by riding them down over and over again
633,20,"until he took the stiffness out of them,"
634,20,"and not one but hung limp, not one was left"
635,20,"for him to conquer, he learned all there was"
636,20,to learn about not launching out too soon
637,20,and so not carrying the tree away
638,20,"clear to the ground, he always kept his poise"
639,20,"to the top branches, climbing carefully"
640,20,with the same pains you use to fill a cup
641,20,"up to the brim, and even above the brim,"
642,20,"then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,"
643,20,"kicking his way down through the air to the ground,"
644,20,"so was i once myself a swinger of birches,"
645,20,"and so i dream of going back to be,"
646,20,"it's when i'm weary of considerations,"
647,20,and life is too much like a pathless wood
648,20,where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
649,20,"broken across it, and one eye is weeping"
650,20,"from a twig's having lashed across it open,"
651,20,i'd like to get away from earth awhile
652,20,"and then come back to it and begin over,"
653,20,may no fate willfully misunderstand me
654,20,and half grant what i wish and snatch me away
655,20,"not to return, earth's the right place for love,"
656,20,"i don't know where it's likely to go better,"
657,20,"i'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,"
658,20,and climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
659,20,"toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,"
660,20,"but dipped its top and set me down again,"
661,20,"that would be good both going and coming back,"
662,20,"one could do worse than be a swinger of birches,"
663,21,love has earth to which she clings
664,21,with hills and circling arms about--
665,21,"wall within wall to shut fear out,"
666,21,"but thought has need of no such things,"
667,21,"for thought has a pair of dauntless wings,"
668,21,
669,21,"on snow and sand and turn, i see"
670,21,where love has left a printed trace
671,21,"with straining in the world's embrace,"
672,21,and such is love and glad to be
673,21,"but thought has shaken his ankles free,"
674,21,
675,21,thought cleaves the interstellar gloom
676,21,"and sits in sirius' disc all night,"
677,21,till day makes him retrace his flight
678,21,"with smell of burning on every plume,"
679,21,"back past the sun to an earthly room,"
680,21,
681,21,"his gains in heaven are what they are,"
682,21,yet some say love by being thrall
683,21,and simply staying possesses all
684,21,in several beauty that thought fares far
685,21,"to find fused in another star,"
686,22,"but outer space,"
687,22,"at least this far,"
688,22,for all the fuss
689,22,of the populace
690,22,stays more popular
691,22,than populous
692,23,"as i came to the edge of the woods,"
693,23,thrush music -- hark!
694,23,"now if it was dusk outside,"
695,23,"inside it was dark,"
696,23,
697,23,too dark in the woods for a bird
698,23,by sleight of wing
699,23,"to better its perch for the night,"
700,23,"though it still could sing,"
701,23,
702,23,the last of the light of the sun
703,23,that had died in the west
704,23,still lived for one song more
705,23,"in a thrush's breast,"
706,23,
707,23,far in the pillared dark
708,23,thrush music went --
709,23,almost like a call to come in
710,23,"to the dark and lament,"
711,23,
712,23,"but no, i was out for stars;"
713,23,"i would not come in,"
714,23,i meant not even if asked;
715,23,"and i hadn't been,"
716,24,an ant on the tablecloth
717,24,ran into a dormant moth
718,24,"of many times his size,"
719,24,"he showed not the least surprise,"
720,24,"his business wasn't with such,"
721,24,"he gave it scarcely a touch,"
722,24,"and was off on his duty run,"
723,24,yet if he encountered one
724,24,of the hive's enquiry squad
725,24,whose work is to find out god
726,24,"and the nature of time and space,"
727,24,"he would put him onto the case,"
728,24,ants are a curious race;
729,24,one crossing with hurried tread
730,24,the body of one of their dead
731,24,isn't given a moment's arrest-
732,24,"seems not even impressed,"
733,24,but he no doubt reports to any
734,24,"with whom he crosses antennae,"
735,24,and they no doubt report
736,24,"to the higher-up at court,"
737,24,"then word goes forth in formic,"
738,24,"death's come to jerry mccormic,"
739,24,"our selfless forager jerry,"
740,24,will the special janizary
741,24,whose office it is to bury
742,24,the dead of the commissary
743,24,"go bring him home to his people,"
744,24,"lay him in state on a sepal,"
745,24,"wrap him for shroud in a petal,"
746,24,"embalm him with ichor of nettle,"
747,24,"this is the word of your queen,"
748,24,and presently on the scene
749,24,appears a solemn mortician;
750,24,"and taking formal position,"
751,24,"with feelers calmly atwiddle,"
752,24,"seizes the dead by the middle,"
753,24,"and heaving him high in air,"
754,24,"carries him out of there,"
755,24,"no one stands round to stare,"
756,24,it is nobody else's affair
757,24,it couldn't be called ungentle
758,24,but how thoroughly departmental
759,25,"snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast"
760,25,"in a field i looked into going past,"
761,25,"and the ground almost covered smooth in snow,"
762,25,"but a few weeds and stubble showing last,"
763,25,
764,25,"the woods around it have it - it is theirs,"
765,25,"all animals are smothered in their lairs,"
766,25,i am too absent-spirited to count;
767,25,"the loneliness includes me unawares,"
768,25,
769,25,"and lonely as it is, that loneliness"
770,25,will be more lonely ere it will be less -
771,25,a blanker whiteness of benighted snow
772,25,"with no expression, nothing to express,"
773,25,
774,25,they cannot scare me with their empty spaces
775,25,"between stars - on stars where no human race is,"
776,25,i have it in me so much nearer home
777,25,"to scare myself with my own desert places,"
778,26,"i found a dimpled spider, fat and white,"
779,26,"on a white heal-all, holding up a moth"
780,26,like a white piece of rigid satin cloth --
781,26,assorted characters of death and blight
782,26,"mixed ready to begin the morning right,"
783,26,like the ingredients of a witches' broth --
784,26,"a snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,"
785,26,"and dead wings carried like a paper kite,"
786,26,
787,26,"what had that flower to do with being white,"
788,26,the wayside blue and innocent heal-all?
789,26,"what brought the kindred spider to that height,"
790,26,then steered the white moth thither in the night?
791,26,what but design of darkness to appall?--
792,26,"if design govern in a thing so small,"
793,27,the heart can think of no devotion
794,27,greater than being shore to ocean -
795,27,"holding the curve of one position,"
796,27,"counting an endless repetition,"
797,28,the way a crow
798,28,shook down on me
799,28,the dust of snow
800,28,from a hemlock tree
801,28,has given my heart
802,28,a change of mood
803,28,and saved some part
804,28,"of a day i had rued,"
805,29,from where i lingered in a lull in march
806,29,"outside the sugar-house one night for choice,"
807,29,i called the fireman with a careful voice
808,29,"and bade him leave the pan and stoke the arch,"
809,29,"'o fireman, give the fire another stoke,"
810,29,"and send more sparks up chimney with the smoke,'"
811,29,"i thought a few might tangle, as they did,"
812,29,"among bare maple boughs, and in the rare"
813,29,"hill atmosphere not cease to glow,"
814,29,"and so be added to the moon up there,"
815,29,"the moon, though slight, was moon enough to show"
816,29,"on every tree a bucket with a lid,"
817,29,"and on black ground a bear-skin rug of snow,"
818,29,"the sparks made no attempt to be the moon,"
819,29,they were content to figure in the trees
820,29,"as leo, orion, and the pleiades,"
821,29,"and that was what the boughs were full of soon,"
822,30,"some say the world will end in fire,"
823,30,"  some say in ice,"
824,30,  from what i've tasted of desire
825,30,"  i hold with those who favor fire,"
826,30,"  but if it had to perish twice,"
827,30,  i think i know enough of hate
828,30,  to know that for destruction ice
829,30,  is also great
830,30,"  and would suffice,"
831,31,"here come real stars to fill the upper skies,"
832,31,"and here on earth come emulating flies,"
833,31,"that though they never equal stars in size,"
834,31,and they were never really stars at heart
835,31,"achieve at times a very star-like start,"
836,31,"only, of course, they can't sustain the part,"
837,32,"i left you in the morning,"
838,32,"and in the morning glow,"
839,32,you walked a way beside me
840,32,"to make me sad to go,"
841,32,"do you know me in the gloaming,"
842,32,gaunt and dusty gray with roaming?
843,32,"are you dumb because you know me not,"
844,32,or dumb because you know?
845,32,
846,32,all for me  and not a question
847,32,for the faded flowers gay
848,32,that could take me from beside you
849,32,for the ages of a day?
850,32,"they are yours, and be the measure"
851,32,"of their worth for you to treasure,"
852,32,the measure of the little while
853,32,"that i've been long away,"
854,33,others taught me with having knelt at well-curbs
855,33,"  always wrong to the light, so never seeing"
856,33,  deeper down in the well than where the water
857,33,  gives me back in a shining surface picture
858,33,  me myself in the summer heaven godlike
859,33,"  looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs,"
860,33,"  once, when trying with chin against a well-curb,"
861,33,"  i discerned, as i thought, beyond the picture,"
862,33,"  through the picture, a something white, uncertain,"
863,33," something more of the depths--and then i lost it,"
864,33," water came to rebuke the too clear water,"
865,33," one drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple"
866,33," shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,"
867,33," blurred it, blotted it out, what was that whiteness?"
868,33,
869,33," truth? a pebble of quartz? for once, then, something,"
870,34,why make so much of fragmentary blue
871,34,"in here and there a bird, or butterfly,"
872,34,"or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,"
873,34,when heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?
874,34,
875,34,"since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven as yet--"
876,34,though some savants make earth include the sky;
877,34,"and blue so far above us comes so high,"
878,34,"it only gives our wish for blue a whet,"
879,35,spades take up leaves
880,35,"no better than spoons,"
881,35,and bags full of leaves
882,35,"are light as balloons,"
883,35,
884,35,i make a great noise
885,35,of rustling all day
886,35,like rabbit and deer
887,35,"running away,"
888,35,
889,35,but the mountains i raise
890,35,"elude my embrace,"
891,35,flowing over my arms
892,35,"and into my face,"
893,35,
894,35,i may load and unload
895,35,again and again
896,35,"till i fill the whole shed,"
897,35,and what have i then?
898,35,
899,35,"next to nothing for weight,"
900,35,and since they grew duller
901,35,"from contact with earth,"
902,35,"next to nothing for color,"
903,35,
904,35,"next to nothing for use,"
905,35,"but a crop is a crop,"
906,35,and who's to say where
907,35,the harvest shall stop?
908,36,i dwell in a lonely house i know
909,36,"that vanished many a summer ago,"
910,36,"and left no trace but the cellar walls,"
911,36,"and a cellar in which the daylight falls,"
912,36,"and the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow,"
913,36,
914,36,o'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield
915,36,the woods come back to the mowing field;
916,36,the orchard tree has grown one copse
917,36,of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops;
918,36,"the footpath down to the well is healed,"
919,36,
920,36,i dwell with a strangely aching heart
921,36,in that vanished abode there far apart
922,36,on that disused and forgotten road
923,36,"that has no dust-bath now for the toad,"
924,36,night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;
925,36,
926,36,the whippoorwill is coming to shout
927,36,"and hush and cluck and flutter about,"
928,36,i hear him begin far enough away
929,36,full many a time to say his say
930,36,"before he arrives to say it out,"
931,36,
932,36,"it is under the small, dim, summer star,"
933,36,i know not who these mute folk are
934,36,who share the unlit place with me--
935,36,those stones out under the low-limbed tree
936,36,"doubtless bear names that the mosses mar,"
937,36,
938,36,"they are tireless folk, but slow and sad,"
939,36,"though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,--"
940,36,"with none among them that ever sings,"
941,36,"and yet, in view of how many things,"
942,36,"as sweet companions as might be had,"
943,37,"the well was dry beside the door,"
944,37,and so we went with pail and can
945,37,across the fields behind the house
946,37,to seek the brook if still it ran;
947,37,"not loth to have excuse to go,"
948,37,because the autumn eve was fair
949,37,"though chill, because the fields were ours,"
950,37,"and by the brook our woods were there,"
951,37,
952,37,we ran as if to meet the moon
953,37,"that slowly dawned behind the trees,"
954,37,"the barren boughs without the leaves,"
955,37,"without the birds, without the breeze,"
956,37,
957,37,"but once within the wood, we paused"
958,37,"like gnomes that hid us from the moon,"
959,37,ready to run to hiding new
960,37,"with laughter when she found us soon,"
961,37,
962,37,each laid on other a staying hand
963,37,"to listen ere we dared to look,"
964,37,and in the hush we joined to make
965,37,"we heard, we knew we heard the brook,"
966,37,
967,37,"a note as from a single place,"
968,37,a slender tinkling fall that made
969,37,now drops that floated on the pool
970,37,"like pearls, and now a silver blade,"
971,38,this saying good-bye on the edge of the dark
972,38,  and cold to an orchard so young in the bark
973,38,  reminds me of all that can happen to harm
974,38,  an orchard away at the end of the farm
975,38,"  all winter, cut off by a hill from the house,"
976,38,"  i don't want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,"
977,38,  i don't want it dreamily nibbled for browse
978,38,"  by deer, and i don't want it budded by grouse,"
979,38,  if certain it wouldn't be idle to call
980,38," i'd summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall"
981,38," and warn them away with a stick for a gun,"
982,38," i don't want it stirred by the heat of the sun,"
983,38," we made it secure against being, i hope,"
984,38," by setting it out on a northerly slope,"
985,38, no orchard's the worse for the wintriest storm;
986,38," but one thing about it, it mustn't get warm,"
987,38," how often already you've had to be told,"
988,38," keep cold, young orchard, good-bye and keep cold,"
989,38," dread fifty above more than fifty below,"
990,38," i have to be gone for a season or so,"
991,38," my business awhile is with different trees,"
992,38," less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,"
993,38, and such as is done to their wood with an axe--
994,38," maples and birches and tamaracks,"
995,38, i wish i could promise to lie in the night
996,38, and think of an orchard's arboreal plight
997,38, when slowly and nobody comes with a light
998,38," its heart sinks lower under the sod,"
999,38," but something has to be left to god,"
1000,39,"was there even a cause too lost,"
1001,39,"ever a cause that was lost too long,"
1002,39,or that showed with the lapse of time to vain
1003,39,for the generous tears of youth and song?
1004,40,he saw her from the bottom of the stairs
1005,40,"before she saw him, she was starting down,"
1006,40,"looking back over her shoulder at some fear,"
1007,40,she took a doubtful step and then undid it
1008,40,"to raise herself and look again, he spoke"
1009,40,"advancing toward her, what is it you see"
1010,40,"from up there always? -- for i want to know,"
1011,40,"she turned and sank upon her skirts at that,"
1012,40,"and her face changed from terrified to dull,"
1013,40,"he said to gain time, what is it you see?"
1014,40,"mounting until she cowered under him,"
1015,40,"i will find out now -- you must tell me, dear,"
1016,40,"she, in her place, refused him any help,"
1017,40,"with the least stiffening of her neck and silence,"
1018,40,"she let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,"
1019,40,"blind creature; and a while he didn't see,"
1020,40,"but at last he murmured, oh and again, oh,"
1021,40,
1022,40,"what is it -- what? she said,"
1023,40,
1024,40,"just that i see,"
1025,40,
1026,40,"you don't, she challenged, tell me what it is,"
1027,40,
1028,40,"the wonder is i didn't see at once,"
1029,40,"i never noticed it from here before,"
1030,40,"i must be wonted to it -- that's the reason,"
1031,40,the little graveyard where my people are!
1032,40,"so small the window frames the whole of it,"
1033,40,"not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?"
1034,40,"there are three stones of slate and one of marble,"
1035,40,broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
1036,40,"on the sidehill, we haven't to mind those,"
1037,40,"but i understand, it is not the stones,"
1038,40,but the child's mound ----
1039,40,
1040,40,"don't, don't, don't,"
1041,40,"don't, she cried,"
1042,40,
1043,40,"she withdrew, shrinking from beneath his arm"
1044,40,"that rested on the banister, and slid downstairs;"
1045,40,"and turned on him with such a daunting look,"
1046,40,"he said twice over before he knew himself,"
1047,40,can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?
1048,40,
1049,40,"not you! -- oh, where's my hat? oh, i don't need it!"
1050,40,"i must get out of here, i must get air,--"
1051,40,"i don't know rightly whether any man can,"
1052,40,
1053,40,"amy! don't go to someone else this time,"
1054,40,"listen to me, i won't come down the stairs,"
1055,40,"he sat and fixed his chin between his fists,"
1056,40,"there's something i should like to ask you, dear,"
1057,40,
1058,40,"you don't know how to ask it,"
1059,40,"help me, then,"
1060,40,
1061,40,"her fingers moved the latch for all reply,"
1062,40,
1063,40,"my words are nearly always an offense,"
1064,40,i don't know how to speak of anything
1065,40,"so as to please you, but i might be taught,"
1066,40,"i should suppose, i can't say i see how,"
1067,40,a man must partly give up being a man
1068,40,"with womenfolk, we could have some arrangement"
1069,40,by which i'd bind myself to keep hands off
1070,40,"anything special you're a-mind to name,"
1071,40,"though i don't like such things 'twixt those that love,"
1072,40,"two that don't love can't live together without them,"
1073,40,"but two that do can't live together with them,"
1074,40,"she moved the latch a little, don't -- don't go,"
1075,40,"don't carry it to someone else this time,"
1076,40,"tell me about it if it's something human,"
1077,40,"let me into your grief, i'm not so much"
1078,40,unlike other folks as your standing there
1079,40,"apart would make me out, give me my chance,"
1080,40,"i do think, though, you overdo it a little,"
1081,40,what was it brought you up to think it the thing
1082,40,to take your mother-loss of a first child
1083,40,"so inconsolably -- in the face of love,"
1084,40,you'd think his memory might be satisfied ----
1085,40,
1086,40,there you go sneering now!
1087,40,
1088,40,"    i'm not, i'm not!"
1089,40,"you make me angry, i'll come down to you,"
1090,40,"god, what a woman! and it's come to this,"
1091,40,"a man can't speak of his own child that's dead,"
1092,40,
1093,40,"you can't because you don't know how to speak,"
1094,40,"if you had any feelings, you that dug"
1095,40,with your own hand -- how could you? -- his little grave;
1096,40,"i saw you from that very window there,"
1097,40,"making the gravel leap and leap in air,"
1098,40,"leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly"
1099,40,"and roll back down the mound beside the hole,"
1100,40,"i thought, who is that man? i didn't know you,"
1101,40,and i crept down the stairs and up the stairs
1102,40,"to look again, and still your spade kept lifting,"
1103,40,"then you came in, i heard your rumbling voice"
1104,40,"out in the kitchen, and i don't know why,"
1105,40,"but i went near to see with my own eyes,"
1106,40,you could sit there with the stains on your shoes
1107,40,of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave
1108,40,"and talk about your everyday concerns,"
1109,40,you had stood the spade up against the wall
1110,40,"outside there in the entry, for i saw it,"
1111,40,
1112,40,"i shall laugh the worst laugh i ever laughed,"
1113,40,"i'm cursed, god, if i don't believe i'm cursed,"
1114,40,
1115,40,"i can repeat the very words you were saying,"
1116,40,'three foggy mornings and one rainy day
1117,40,"will rot the best birch fence a man can build,'"
1118,40,"think of it, talk like that at such a time!"
1119,40,what had how long it takes a birch to rot
1120,40,to do with what was in the darkened parlour?
1121,40,you couldn't care! the nearest friends can go
1122,40,"with anyone to death, comes so far short"
1123,40,"they might as well not try to go at all,"
1124,40,"no, from the time when one is sick to death,"
1125,40,"one is alone, and he dies more alone,"
1126,40,"friends make pretense of following to the grave,"
1127,40,"but before one is in it, their minds are turned"
1128,40,and making the best of their way back to life
1129,40,"and living people, and things they understand,"
1130,40,"but the world's evil, i won't have grief so"
1131,40,"if i can change it, oh, i won't, i won't!"
1132,40,
1133,40,"there, you have said it all and you feel better,"
1134,40,"you won't go now, you're crying, close the door,"
1135,40,"the heart's gone out of it, why keep it up?"
1136,40,amyl there's someone coming down the road!
1137,40,
1138,40,"you -- oh, you think the talk is all, i must go --"
1139,40,"somewhere out of this house, how can i make you ----"
1140,40,
1141,40,"if -- you -- do! she was opening the door wider,"
1142,40,"where do you mean to go? first tell me that,"
1143,40,"i'll follow and bring you back by force, i will! --"
1144,41,"by june our brook's run out of song and speed,"
1145,41,"sought for much after that, it will be found"
1146,41,either to have gone groping underground
1147,41,and taken with it all the hyla breed
1148,41,"that shouted in the mist a month ago,"
1149,41,like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow--
1150,41,"or flourished and come up in jewel-weed,"
1151,41,weak foliage that is blown upon and bent
1152,41,"even against the way its waters went,"
1153,41,its bed is left a faded paper sheet
1154,41,of dead leaves stuck together by the heat--
1155,41,"a brook to none but who remember long,"
1156,41,this as it will be seen is other far
1157,41,"than with brooks taken otherwhere in song,"
1158,41,"we love the things we love for what they are,"
1159,42,the living come with grassy tread
1160,42,to read the gravestones on the hill;
1161,42,"the graveyard draws the living still,"
1162,42,"but never anymore the dead,"
1163,42,"the verses in it say and say,"
1164,42,the ones who living come today
1165,42,to read the stones and go away
1166,42,"tomorrow dead will come to stay,"
1167,42,"so sure of death the marbles rhyme,"
1168,42,yet can't help marking all the time
1169,42,"how no one dead will seem to come,"
1170,42,what is it men are shrinking from?
1171,42,it would be easy to be clever
1172,42,"and tell the stones, men hate to die"
1173,42,"and have stopped dying now forever,"
1174,42,"i think they would believe the lie,"
1175,43,"when i was young, we dwelt in a vale"
1176,43,"   by a misty fen that rang all night,"
1177,43,   and thus it was the maidens pale
1178,43,"   i knew so well, whose garments trail"
1179,43,"   across the reeds to a window light,"
1180,43,"   the fen had every kind of bloom,"
1181,43,"   and for every kind there was a face,"
1182,43,   and a voice that has sounded in my room
1183,43,"   across the sill from the outer gloom,"
1184,43,"   each came singly unto her place,"
1185,43,   but all came every night with the mist;
1186,43,   and often they brought so much to say
1187,43,"   of things of moment to which, they wist,"
1188,43,"   one so lonely was fain to list,"
1189,43,   that the stars were almost faded away
1190,43,"   before the last went, heavy with dew,"
1191,43,   back to the place from which she came--
1192,43,"   where the bird was before it flew,"
1193,43,"   where the flower was before it grew,"
1194,43,"   where bird and flower were one and the same,"
1195,43,   and thus it is i know so well
1196,43,"   why the flower has odor, the bird has song,"
1197,43,"   you have only to ask me, and i can tell,"
1198,43,"   no, not vainly there did i dwell,"
1199,43,"   nor vainly listen all the night long,"
1200,44,"thus of old the douglas did,"
1201,44,   he left his land as he was bid
1202,44,   with the royal heart of robert the bruce
1203,44,"   in a golden case with a golden lid,"
1204,44,   to carry the same to the holy land;
1205,44,   by which we see and understand
1206,44,   that that was the place to carry a heart
1207,44,"   at loyalty and love's command,"
1208,44,"   and that was the case to carry it in,"
1209,44,   the douglas had not far to win
1210,44,"   before he came to the land of spain,"
1211,44,   where long a holy war had been
1212,44,   against the too-victorious moor;
1213,44,   and there his courage could not endure
1214,44,   not to strike a blow for god
1215,44,"   before he made his errand sure,"
1216,44,"   and ever it was intended so,"
1217,44,"   that a man for god should strike a blow,"
1218,44,   no matter the heart he has in charge
1219,44,"   for the holy land where hearts should go,"
1220,44,"   but when in battle the foe were met,"
1221,44,"   the douglas found him sore beset,"
1222,44,   with only strength of the fighting arm
1223,44,   for one more battle passage yet--
1224,44,   and that as vain to save the day
1225,44,   as bring his body safe away--
1226,44,   only a signal deed to do
1227,44,"   and a last sounding word to say,"
1228,44,   the heart he wore in a golden chain
1229,44,"   he swung and flung forth into the plain,"
1230,44,   and followed it crying 'heart or death!'
1231,44,"   and fighting over it perished fain,"
1232,44,"   so may another do of right,"
1233,44,"   give a heart to the hopeless fight,"
1234,44,   the more of right the more he loves;
1235,44,   so may another redouble might
1236,44,"   for a few swift gleams of the angry brand,"
1237,44,   scorning greatly not to demand
1238,44,   in equal sacrifice with his
1239,44,"   the heart he bore to the holy land,"
1240,45,the same leaves over and over again!
1241,45,they fall from giving shade above
1242,45,to make one texture of faded brown
1243,45,"and fit the earth like a leather glove,"
1244,45,
1245,45,before the leaves can mount again
1246,45,"to fill the trees with another shade,"
1247,45,"they must go down past things coming up,"
1248,45,"they must go down into the dark decayed,"
1249,45,
1250,45,they must be pierced by flowers and put
1251,45,"beneath the feet of dancing flowers,"
1252,45,however it is in some other world
1253,45,"i know that this is way in ours,"
1254,46,"they leave us so to the way we took,"
1255,46,"as two in whom them were proved mistaken,"
1256,46,"that we sit sometimes in the wayside nook,"
1257,46,"with mischievous, vagrant, seraphic look,"
1258,46,"and try if we cannot feel forsaken,"
1259,47,a dented spider like a snow drop white
1260,47,"on a white heal-all, holding up a moth"
1261,47,like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth -
1262,47,saw ever curious eye so strange a sight? -
1263,47,"portent in little, assorted death and blight"
1264,47,like the ingredients of a witches' broth? -
1265,47,"the beady spider, the flower like a froth,"
1266,47,"and the moth carried like a paper kite,"
1267,47,
1268,47,"what had that flower to do with being white,"
1269,47,"the blue prunella every child's delight,"
1270,47,what brought the kindred spider to that height?
1271,47,"make we no thesis of the miller's plight,"
1272,47,what but design of darkness and of night?
1273,47,"design, design! do i use the word aright?"
1274,48,"one of my wishes is that those dark trees,"
1275,48,"so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,"
1276,48,"were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,"
1277,48,"but stretched away unto the edge of doom,"
1278,48,
1279,48,i should not be withheld but that some day
1280,48,"into their vastness i should steal away,"
1281,48,"fearless of ever finding open land,"
1282,48,"or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand,"
1283,48,
1284,48,"i do not see why i should e'er turn back,"
1285,48,or those should not set forth upon my track
1286,48,"to overtake me, who should miss me here"
1287,48,"and long to know if still i held them dear,"
1288,48,
1289,48,they would not find me changed from him they knew--
1290,48,"only more sure of all i though was true,"
1291,49,"seek not in me the bit i capital,"
1292,49,"not yet the little dotted in me seek,"
1293,49,"if i have in me any i at all,"
1294,49,"'tis the iota subscript  of the greek,"
1295,49,
1296,49,"so small an i as an attention beggar,"
1297,49,the letter you will find me subscript to
1298,49,"is neither alpha, eta, nor omega,"
1299,49,"but upsilon which is the greek for you, "
1300,50,"a tree's leaves may be ever so good,"
1301,50,"so may its bar, so may its wood;"
1302,50,but unless you put the right thing to its root
1303,50,"it never will show much flower or fruit,"
1304,50,
1305,50,but i may be one who does not care
1306,50,"ever to have tree bloom or bear,"
1307,50,"leaves for smooth and bark for rough,"
1308,50,"leaves and bark may be tree enough,"
1309,50,
1310,50,some giant trees have bloom so small
1311,50,"they might as well have none at all,"
1312,50,"late in life i have come on fern,"
1313,50,"now lichens are due to have their turn,"
1314,50,
1315,50,"i bade men tell me which in brief,"
1316,50,"which is fairer, flower or leaf,"
1317,50,"they did not have the wit to say,"
1318,50,"leaves by night and flowers by day,"
1319,50,
1320,50,"leaves and bar, leaves and bark,"
1321,50,"to lean against and hear in the dark,"
1322,50,"petals i may have once pursued,"
1323,50,"leaves are all my darker mood,"
1324,51,"a stranger came to the door at eve,"
1325,51,"and he spoke the bridegroom fair,"
1326,51,"he bore a green-white stick in his hand,"
1327,51,"and, for all burden, care,"
1328,51,he asked with the eyes more than the lips
1329,51,"for a shelter for the night,"
1330,51,and he turned and looked at the road afar
1331,51,"without a window light,"
1332,51,
1333,51,the bridegroom came forth into the porch
1334,51,"with, 'let us look at the sky,"
1335,51,"and question what of the night to be,"
1336,51,"stranger, you and i,'"
1337,51,"the woodbine leaves littered the yard,"
1338,51,"the woodbine berries were blue,"
1339,51,"autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;"
1340,51,"'stranger, i wish i knew,'"
1341,51,
1342,51,"within, the bride in the dusk alone"
1343,51,"bent over the open fire,"
1344,51,her face rose-red with the glowing coal
1345,51,"and the thought of the heart's desire,"
1346,51,
1347,51,"the bridegroom looked at the weary road,"
1348,51,"yet saw but her within,"
1349,51,and wished her heart in a case of gold
1350,51,"and pinned with a silver pin,"
1351,51,
1352,51,the bridegroom thought it little to give
1353,51,"a dole of bread, a purse,"
1354,51,"a heartfelt prayer for the poor of god,"
1355,51,or for the rich a curse;
1356,51,
1357,51,but whether or not a man was asked
1358,51,to mar the love of two
1359,51,"by harboring woe in the bridal house,"
1360,51,"the bridegroom wished he knew,"
1361,52,as i went down the hill along the wall
1362,52,there was a gate i had leaned at for the view
1363,52,and had just turned from when i first saw you
1364,52,"as you came up the hill, we met, but all"
1365,52,we did that day was mingle great and small
1366,52,footprints in summer dust as if we drew
1367,52,the figure of our being less that two
1368,52,"but more than one as yet, your parasol"
1369,52,"pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust,"
1370,52,and all the time we talked you seemed to see
1371,52,"something down there to smile at in the dust,"
1372,52,"oh, it was without prejudice to me!"
1373,52,afterward i went past what you had passed
1374,52,"before we met and you what i had passed,"
1375,53,"something there is that doesn't love a wall,"
1376,53,"that sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,"
1377,53,and spills the upper boulders in the sun;
1378,53,"and makes gaps even two can pass abreast,"
1379,53,"the work of hunters is another thing,"
1380,53,i have come after them and made repair
1381,53,"where they have left not one stone on a stone,"
1382,53,"but they would have the rabbit out of hiding,"
1383,53,"to please the yelping dogs, the gaps i mean,"
1384,53,"no one has seen them made or heard them made,"
1385,53,"but at spring mending-time we find them there,"
1386,53,i let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
1387,53,and on a day we meet to walk the line
1388,53,"and set the wall between us once again,"
1389,53,"we keep the wall between us as we go,"
1390,53,"to each the boulders that have fallen to each,"
1391,53,and some are loaves and some so nearly balls
1392,53,"we have to use a spell to make them balance,"
1393,53,stay where you are until our backs are turned!
1394,53,"we wear our fingers rough with handling them,"
1395,53,"oh, just another kind of out-door game,"
1396,53,"one on a side, it comes to little more,"
1397,53,"there where it is we do not need the wall,"
1398,53,"he is all pine and i am apple orchard,"
1399,53,my apple trees will never get across
1400,53,"and eat the cones under his pines, i tell him,"
1401,53,"he only says, good fences make good neighbors,"
1402,53,"spring is the mischief in me, and i wonder"
1403,53,"if i could put a notion in his head,"
1404,53,why do they make good neighbors? isn't it
1405,53,"where there are cows? but here there are no cows,"
1406,53,before i built a wall i'd ask to know
1407,53,"what i was walling in or walling out,"
1408,53,"and to whom i was like to give offence,"
1409,53,"something there is that doesn't love a wall,"
1410,53,"that wants it down, i could say elves to him,"
1411,53,"but it's not elves exactly, and i'd rather"
1412,53,"he said it for himself, i see him there"
1413,53,bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
1414,53,"in each hand, like an old-stone savage armed,"
1415,53,"he moves in darkness as it seems to me,"
1416,53,"not of woods only and the shade of trees,"
1417,53,"he will not go behind his father's saying,"
1418,53,and he likes having thought of it so well
1419,53,"he says again, good fences make good neighbors,"
1420,54,"there was never a sound beside the wood but one,"
1421,54,"and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground,"
1422,54,what was it it whispered? i knew not well myself;
1423,54,"perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,"
1424,54,"something, perhaps, about the lack of sound--"
1425,54,"and that was why it whispered and did not speak,"
1426,54,"it was no dream of the gift of idle hours,"
1427,54,"or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf,"
1428,54,anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
1429,54,"to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,"
1430,54,not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
1431,54,"pale orchises, and scared a bright green snake,"
1432,54,"the fact is the sweetest dream that labour knows,"
1433,54,"my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make,"
1434,55,"thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too,"
1435,55,"and the daft sun-assaulter, he"
1436,55,"that frightened thee so oft, is fled or dead,"
1437,55,save only me
1438,55,nor is it sad to thee!
1439,55,save only me
1440,55,"there is none left to mourn thee in the fields,"
1441,55,
1442,55,the gray grass is scarce dappled with the snow;
1443,55,its two banks have not shut upon the river;
1444,55,but it is long ago--
1445,55,it seems forever--
1446,55,"since first i saw thee glance,"
1447,55,"with all thy dazzling other ones,"
1448,55,"in airy dalliance,"
1449,55,"precipitate in love,"
1450,55,"tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above,"
1451,55,"like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance,"
1452,55,
1453,55,"when that was, the soft mist"
1454,55,"of my regret hung not on all the land,"
1455,55,"and i was glad for thee,"
1456,55,"and glad for me, i wist,"
1457,55,
1458,55,"thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high,"
1459,55,"that fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind,"
1460,55,"with those great careless wings,"
1461,55,"nor yet did i,"
1462,55,
1463,55,"and there were other things,"
1464,55,"it seemed god let thee flutter from his gentle clasp,"
1465,55,then fearful he had let thee win
1466,55,"too far beyond him to be gathered in,"
1467,55,"santched thee, o'ereager, with ungentle gasp,"
1468,55,
1469,55,ah! i remember me
1470,55,how once conspiracy was rife
1471,55,against my life--
1472,55,the languor of it and the dreaming fond;
1473,55,"surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought,"
1474,55,"the breeze three odors brought,"
1475,55,and a gem-flower waved in a wand!
1476,55,
1477,55,then when i was distraught
1478,55,"and could not speak,"
1479,55,"sidelong, full on my cheek,"
1480,55,what should that reckless zephyr fling
1481,55,but the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing!
1482,55,
1483,55,i found that wing broken today!
1484,55,"for thou art dead, i said,"
1485,55,"and the strange birds say,"
1486,55,i found it with the withered leaves
1487,55,"under the eaves,"
1488,56,"my sorrow, when she's here with me,"
1489,56,thinks these dark days of autumn rain
1490,56,are beautiful as days can be;
1491,56,"she loves the bare, the withered tree;"
1492,56,"she walks the sodden pasture lane,"
1493,56,
1494,56,"her pleasure will not let me stay,"
1495,56,"she talks and i am fain to list,"
1496,56,"she's glad the birds are gone away,"
1497,56,she's glad her simple worsted grey
1498,56,"is silver now with clinging mist,"
1499,56,
1500,56,"the desolate, deserted trees,"
1501,56,"the faded earth, the heavy sky,"
1502,56,"the beauties she so truly sees,"
1503,56,"she thinks i have no eye for these,"
1504,56,"and vexes me for reason why,"
1505,56,
1506,56,not yesterday i learned to know
1507,56,the love of bare november days
1508,56,"before the coming of the snow,"
1509,56,"but it were vain to tell her so,"
1510,56,and they are better for her praise
1511,57,the people along the sand
1512,57,"all turn and look one way,"
1513,57,"they turn their back on the land,"
1514,57,"they look at the sea all day,"
1515,57,
1516,57,as long as it takes to pass
1517,57,a ship keeps raising its hull;
1518,57,the wetter ground like glass
1519,57,reflects a standing gull
1520,57,
1521,57,the land may vary more;
1522,57,but wherever the truth may be--
1523,57,"the water comes ashore,"
1524,57,"and the people look at the sea,"
1525,57,
1526,57,"they cannot look out far,"
1527,57,"they cannot look in deep,"
1528,57,btu when was that ever a bar
1529,57,to any watch they keep?
1530,58,he would declare and could himself believe
1531,58,that the birds there in all the garden round
1532,58,from having heard the daylong voice of eve
1533,58,"had added to their own an oversound,"
1534,58,"her tone of meaning but without the words,"
1535,58,admittedly an eloquence so soft
1536,58,could only have had an influence on birds
1537,58,"when call or laughter carried it aloft,"
1538,58,"be that as may be, she was in their song,"
1539,58,moreover her voice upon their voices crossed
1540,58,had now persisted in the woods so long
1541,58,"that probably it never would be lost,"
1542,58,"never again would birds' song be the same,"
1543,58,"and to do that to birds was why she came,"
1544,59,"they sent him back to her, the letter came"
1545,59,"saying, and she could have him, and before"
1546,59,she could be sure there was no hidden ill
1547,59,"under the formal writing, he was in her sight,"
1548,59,"living, they gave him back to her alive"
1549,59,how else? they are not known to send the dead
1550,59,"and not disfigured visibly, his face?"
1551,59,"his hands? she had to look, and ask,"
1552,59,"what was it, dear? and she had given all"
1553,59,and still she had all they had they the lucky!
1554,59,"wasn’t she glad now? everything seemed won,"
1555,59,"and all the rest for them permissible ease,"
1556,59,"she had to ask, what was it, dear?"
1557,59,
1558,59,"enough,"
1559,59,"yet not enough, a bullet through and through,"
1560,59,"high in the breast, nothing but what good care"
1561,59,"and medicine and rest, and you a week,"
1562,59,"can cure me of to go again, the same"
1563,59,"grim giving to do over for them both,"
1564,59,she dared no more than ask him with her eyes
1565,59,"how was it with him for a second trial,"
1566,59,"and with his eyes he asked her not to ask,"
1567,59,"they had given him back to her, but not to keep,"
1568,60,"nature's first green is gold,"
1569,60,"her hardest hue to hold,"
1570,60,
1571,60,her early leaf's a flower;
1572,60,"but only so an hour,"
1573,60,
1574,60,"then leaf subsides to leaf,"
1575,60,"so eden sank to grief,"
1576,60,
1577,60,"so dawn goes down to day,"
1578,60,"nothing gold can stay,"
1579,61,"now close the windows and hush all the fields,"
1580,61,"if the trees must, let them silently toss;"
1581,61,"no bird is singing now, and if there is,"
1582,61,"be it my loss,"
1583,61,
1584,61,"it will be long ere the marshes resume,"
1585,61,"i will be long ere the earliest bird,"
1586,61,"so close the windows and not hear the wind,"
1587,61,"but see all wind-stirred,"
1588,62,"o hushed october morning mild,"
1589,62,thy leaves have ripened to the fall;
1590,62,"tomorrow's wind, if it be wild,"
1591,62,"should waste them all,"
1592,62,the crows above the forest call;
1593,62,"tomorrow they may form and go,"
1594,62,"o hushed october morning mild,"
1595,62,"begin the hours of this day slow,"
1596,62,"make the day seem to us less brief,"
1597,62,"hearts not averse to being beguiled,"
1598,62,"beguile us in the way you know,"
1599,62,release one leaf at break of day;
1600,62,at noon release another leaf;
1601,62,"one from our trees, one far away,"
1602,62,retard the sun with gentle mist;
1603,62,"enchant the land with amethyst,"
1604,62,"slow, slow!"
1605,62,"for the grapes' sake, if the were all,"
1606,62,"whose elaves already are burnt with frost,"
1607,62,whose clustered fruit must else be lost--
1608,62,"for the grapes' sake along the all,"
1609,63,to hear us talk
1610,63,
1611,63,the tree the tempest with a crash of wood
1612,63,throws down in front of us is not bar
1613,63,"our passage to our journey's end for good,"
1614,63,but just to ask us who we think we are
1615,63,
1616,63,"insisting always on our own way so,"
1617,63,"she likes to halt us in our runner tracks,"
1618,63,and make us get down in a foot of snow
1619,63,"debating what to do without an ax,"
1620,63,
1621,63,"and yet she knows obstruction is in vain,"
1622,63,we will not be put off the final goal
1623,63,"we have it hidden in us to attain,"
1624,63,not though we have to seize earth by the pole
1625,63,
1626,63,"and, tired of aimless circling in one place,"
1627,63,"steer straight off after something into space,"
1628,64,"you'll wait a long, long time for anything much"
1629,64,to happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud
1630,64,"and the northern lights that run like tingling nerves,"
1631,64,"the sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch,"
1632,64,"nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud,"
1633,64,the planets seem to interfere in their curves -
1634,64,"but nothing ever happens, no harm is done,"
1635,64,"we may as well go patiently on with our life,"
1636,64,and look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun
1637,64,"for the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane,"
1638,64,"it is true the longest drought will end in rain,"
1639,64,"the longest peace in china will end in strife,"
1640,64,still it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake
1641,64,in hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break
1642,64,"on his particular time and personal sight,"
1643,64,"that calm seems certainly safe to last to-night,"
1644,65,"the shattered water made a misty din,"
1645,65,"great waves looked over others coming in,"
1646,65,and thought of doing something to the shore
1647,65,"that water never did to land before,"
1648,65,"the clouds were low and hairy in the skies,"
1649,65,"like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes,"
1650,65,"you could not tell, and yet it looked as if"
1651,65,"the shore was lucky in being backed by cliff,"
1652,65,the cliff in being backed by continent;
1653,65,it looked as if a night of dark intent
1654,65,"was coming, and not only a night, an age,"
1655,65,"someone had better be prepared for rage,"
1656,65,there would be more than ocean-water broken
1657,65,"before god's last put out the light was spoken,"
1658,66,not only sands and gravels
1659,66,"were once more on their travels,"
1660,66,but gulping muddy gallons
1661,66,great boulders off their balance
1662,66,bumped heads together dully
1663,66,"and started down the gully,"
1664,66,"whole capes caked off in slices,"
1665,66,i felt my standpoint shaken
1666,66,"in the universal crisis,"
1667,66,but with one step backward taken
1668,66,"i saved myself from going,"
1669,66,"a world torn loose went by me,"
1670,66,"then the rain stopped and the blowing,"
1671,66,"and the sun came out to dry me,"
1672,67,the buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard
1673,67,"and made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,"
1674,67,"sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it,"
1675,67,and from there those that lifted eyes could count
1676,67,five mountain ranges one behind the other
1677,67,"under the sunset far into vermont,"
1678,67,"and the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,"
1679,67,"as it ran light, or had to bear a load,"
1680,67,"and nothing happened, day was all but done,"
1681,67,"call it a day, i wish they might have said"
1682,67,to please the boy by giving him the half hour
1683,67,"that a boy counts so much when saved from work,"
1684,67,his sister stood beside them in her apron
1685,67,"to tell them supper, at the word, the saw,"
1686,67,"as if to prove saws knew what supper meant,"
1687,67,"leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap--"
1688,67,"he must have given the hand, however it was,"
1689,67,"neither refused the meeting, but the hand!"
1690,67,"the boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh,"
1691,67,as he swung toward them holding up the hand
1692,67,"half in appeal, but half as if to keep"
1693,67,"the life from spilling, then the boy saw all--"
1694,67,"since he was old enough to know, big boy"
1695,67,"doing a man's work, though a child at heart--"
1696,67,"he saw all spoiled, don't let him cut my hand off--"
1697,67,"the doctor, when he comes, don't let him, sister!"
1698,67,"so, but the hand was gone already,"
1699,67,"the doctor put him in the dark of ether,"
1700,67,"he lay and puffed his lips out with his breath,"
1701,67,"and then--the watcher at his pulse took fright,"
1702,67,"no one believed, they listened at his heart,"
1703,67,"little--less--nothing!--and that ended it,"
1704,67,"no more to build on there, and they, since they"
1705,67,"were not the one dead, turned to their affairs,"
1706,68,"pan came out of the woods one day,--"
1707,68,"his skin and his hair and his eyes were gray,"
1708,68,"the gray of the moss of walls were they,--"
1709,68, and stood in the sun and looked his fill
1710,68," at wooded valley and wooded hill,"
1711,68,
1712,68,"he stood in the zephyr, pipes in hand,"
1713,68,on a height of naked pasture land;
1714,68,in all the country he did command
1715,68," he saw no smoke and he saw no roof,"
1716,68," that was well! and he stamped a hoof,"
1717,68,
1718,68,"his heart knew peace, for none came here"
1719,68,to this lean feeding save once a year
1720,68,"someone to salt the half-wild steer,"
1721,68, or homespun children with clicking pails
1722,68," who see so little they tell no tales,"
1723,68,
1724,68,"he tossed his pipes, too hard to teach"
1725,68,"a new-world song, far out of reach,"
1726,68,for sylvan sign that the blue jay's screech
1727,68, and the whimper of hawks beside the sun
1728,68," were music enough for him, for one,"
1729,68,
1730,68,"times were changed from what they were,"
1731,68,such pipes kept less of power to stir
1732,68,the fruited bough of the juniper
1733,68, and the fragile bluets clustered there
1734,68," than the merest aimless breath of air,"
1735,68,
1736,68,"they were pipes of pagan mirth,"
1737,68,"and the world had found new terms of worth,"
1738,68,he laid him down on the sun-burned earth
1739,68, and raveled a flower and looked away--
1740,68, play? play?--what should he play?
1741,69,"a plow, they say, to plow the snow,"
1742,69,"they cannot mean to plant it, no --"
1743,69,unless in bitterness to mock
1744,69,"at having cultivated rock,"
1745,70,the witch that came the withered hag
1746,70,"to wash the steps with pail and rag,"
1747,70,"was once the beauty abishag,"
1748,70,
1749,70,"the picture pride of hollywood,"
1750,70,too many fall from great and good
1751,70,"for you to doubt the likelihood,"
1752,70,
1753,70,"die early and avoid the fate,"
1754,70,"or if predestined to die late,"
1755,70,"make up your mind to die in state,"
1756,70,
1757,70,make the whole stock exchange your own!
1758,70,"if need be occupy a throne,"
1759,70,"where nobody can call you crone,"
1760,70,
1761,70,some have relied on what they knew;
1762,70,"others on simply being true,"
1763,70,"what worked for them might work for you,"
1764,70,
1765,70,no memory of having starred
1766,70,"atones for later disregard,"
1767,70,"or keeps the end from being hard,"
1768,70,
1769,70,better to go down dignified
1770,70,with boughten friendship at your side
1771,70,"than none at all, provide, provide!"
1772,71,you come to fetch me from my work to-night
1773,71,"  when supper's on the table, and we'll see"
1774,71,  if i can leave off burying the white
1775,71,"  soft petals fallen from the apple tree,"
1776,71,"  soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite,"
1777,71,"  mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea"
1778,71,  and go along with you ere you lose sight
1779,71,"  of what you came for and become like me,"
1780,71,"  slave to a springtime passion for the earth,"
1781,71, how love burns through the putting in the seed
1782,71, on through the watching for that early birth
1783,71," when, just as the soil tarnishes with weed,"
1784,71,
1785,71, the sturdy seedling with arched body comes
1786,71," shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs,"
1787,72,the battle rent a cobweb diamond-strung
1788,72,and cut a flower beside a ground bird's nest
1789,72,"before it stained a single human breast,"
1790,72,"the stricken flower bent double and so hung,"
1791,72,"and still the bird revisited her young,"
1792,72,a butterfly its fall had dispossessed
1793,72,"a moment sought in air his flower of rest,"
1794,72,"then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung,"

1796,72,on the bare upland pasture there had spread
1797,72,o'ernight 'twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread
1798,72,"and straining cables wet with silver dew,"
1799,72,"a sudden passing bullet shook it dry,"
1800,72,"the indwelling spider ran to greet the fly,"
1801,72,"but finding nothing, sullenly withdrew,"

1815,73," but finding nothing, sullenly withdrew,"
1816,74,out through the fields and the woods
1817,74,and over the walls i have wended;
1818,74,i have climbed the hills of view
1819,74,"and looked at the world, and descended;"
1820,74,"i have come by the highway home,"
1821,74,"and lo, it is ended,"
1822,74,
1823,74,"the leaves are all dead on the group,"
1824,74, save those that the oak is keeping
1825,74,to ravel them one by one
1826,74,and let them go scraping and creeping
1827,74,"out over the crusted snow,"
1828,74,"when others are sleeping,"
1829,74,
1830,74,"and the dead leaves lie huddled and still,"
1831,74,no longer blown hither and thither;
1832,74,the last long aster is gone;
1833,74,the flowers of the witch-hazel wither;
1834,74,"the heart is still aching to seek,"
1835,74,but the feel question 'whither?'
1836,74,
1837,74,"ah, when to the heart of man"
1838,74,was it ever less than a treason
1839,74,"to go with the drift of things,"
1840,74,"to yield with a grace to reason,"
1841,74,and bow and accept the end
1842,74,of a love or a season?
1843,75,we make ourselves a place apart
1844,75,"behind light words that tease and flout,"
1845,75,"but oh, the agitated heart"
1846,75,"till someone find us really out,"
1847,75,
1848,75,'tis pity if the case require
1849,75,or so we say that in the end
1850,75,we speak the literal to inspire
1851,75,"the understanding of a friend,"
1852,75,
1853,75,"but so with all, from babes that play"
1854,75,"at hide-and-seek to god afar,"
1855,75,so all who hide too well away
1856,75,"must speak and tell us where they are,"
1857,76,"a saturated meadow,"
1858,76," sun-shaped and jewel-small,"
1859,76,a circle scarcely wider
1860,76, than the trees around were tall;
1861,76,"where winds were quite excluded,"
1862,76, and the air was stifling sweet
1863,76,"with the breath of many flowers, --"
1864,76," a temple of the heat,"
1865,76,
1866,76,"there we bowed us in the burning,"
1867,76," as the sun's right worship is,"
1868,76,to pick where none could miss them
1869,76, a thousand orchises;
1870,76,"for though the grass was scattered,"
1871,76, yet every second spear
1872,76,"seemed tipped with wings of color,"
1873,76," that tinged the atmosphere,"
1874,76,
1875,76,we raised a simple prayer
1876,76," before we left the spot,"
1877,76,that in the general mowing
1878,76, that place might be forgot;
1879,76,"or if not all so favored,"
1880,76," obtain such grace of hours,"
1881,76,that none should mow the grass there
1882,76," while so confused with flowers,"
1883,77,two fairies it was
1884,77,   on a still summer day
1885,77,   came forth in the woods
1886,77,"   with the flowers to play,"
1887,77,   the flowers they plucked
1888,77,   they cast on the ground
1889,77,"   for others, and those"
1890,77,"   for still others they found,"
1891,77,   flower-guided it was
1892,77,   that they came as they ran
1893,77,   on something that lay
1894,77,"   in the shape of a man,"
1895,77,   the snow must have made
1896,77,   the feathery bed
1897,77,   when this one fell
1898,77,"   on the sleep of the dead,"
1899,77,   but the snow was gone
1900,77,"   a long time ago,"
1901,77,   and the body he wore
1902,77,"   nigh gone with the snow,"
1903,77,   the fairies drew near
1904,77,   and keenly espied
1905,77,   a ring on his hand
1906,77,"   and a chain at his side,"
1907,77,   they knelt in the leaves
1908,77,   and eerily played
1909,77,"   with the glittering things,"
1910,77,"   and were not afraid,"
1911,77,   and when they went home
1912,77,"   to hide in their burrow,"
1913,77,   they took them along
1914,77,"   to play with to-morrow,"
1915,77,"   when you came on death,"
1916,77,   did you not come flower-guided
1917,77,   like the elves in the wood?
1918,77,"   i remember that i did,"
1919,77,   but i recognised death
1920,77,"   with sorrow and dread,"
1921,77,   and i hated and hate
1922,77,"   the spoils of the dead,"
1923,78,"these pools that, though in forests, still reflect"
1924,78,"the total sky almost without defect,"
1925,78,"and like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver,"
1926,78,"will like the flowers beside them soon be gone,"
1927,78,"and yet not out by any brook or river,"
1928,78,"but up by roots to bring dark foliage on,"
1929,78,
1930,78,the trees that have it in their pent-up buds
1931,78,to darken nature and be summer woods -
1932,78,let them think twice before they use their powers
1933,78,to blot out and drink up and sweep away
1934,78,these flowery waters and these watery flowers
1935,78,"from snow that melted only yesterday,"
1936,79,how countlessly they congregate
1937,79,"o'er our tumultuous snow,"
1938,79,which flows in shapes as tall as trees
1939,79,when wintry winds do blow!--
1940,79,
1941,79,"as if with keenness for our fate,"
1942,79,our faltering few steps on
1943,79,"to white rest, and a place of rest"
1944,79,"invisible at dawn,--"
1945,79,
1946,79,"and yet with neither love nor hate,"
1947,79,those stars like some snow-white
1948,79,minerva's snow-white marble eyes
1949,79,"without the gift of sight,"
1950,80,"whose woods these are i think i know,"
1951,80,  his house is in the village though;
1952,80,  he will not see me stopping here
1953,80,"  to watch his woods fill up with snow,"
1954,80,  my little horse must think it queer
1955,80,  to stop without a farmhouse near
1956,80,  between the woods and frozen lake
1957,80,"  the darkest evening of the year,"
1958,80,  he gives his harness bells a shake
1959,80,"  to ask if there is some mistake,"
1960,80,  the only other sound's the sweep
1961,80,"  of easy wind and downy flake,"
1962,80,
1963,80," the woods are lovely, dark and deep,"
1964,80," but i have promises to keep,"
1965,80," and miles to go before i sleep,"
1966,80," and miles to go before i sleep,"
1967,81,"when the wind works against us in the dark,"
1968,81,and pelts with snow
1969,81,"the lowest chamber window on the east,"
1970,81,"and whispers with a sort of stifled bark,"
1971,81,"the beast,"
1972,81,'come out! come out!'--
1973,81,"it costs no inward struggle not to go,"
1974,81,"ah, no!"
1975,81,"i count our strength,"
1976,81,"two and a child,"
1977,81,those of us not asleep subdued to mark
1978,81,"how the cold creeps as the fire dies at length,--"
1979,81,"how drifts are piled,"
1980,81,"dooryard and road ungraded,"
1981,81,till even the comforting barn grows far away
1982,81,and my heart owns a doubt
1983,81,whether 'tis in us to arise with day
1984,81,"and save ourselves unaided,"
1985,82,before man to blow to right
1986,82,"the wind once blew itself untaught,"
1987,82,and did its loudest day and night
1988,82,"in any rough place where it caught,"
1989,82,
1990,82,"man came to tell it what was wrong,"
1991,82,it hadn't found the place to blow;
1992,82,"it blew too hard - the aim was song,"
1993,82,and listen - how it ought to go!
1994,82,
1995,82,"he took a little in his mouth,"
1996,82,and held it long enough for north
1997,82,"to be converted into south,"
1998,82,"and then by measure blew it forth,"
1999,82,
2000,82,"by measure, it was word and note,"
2001,82,the wind the wind had meant to be -
2002,82,"a little through the lips and throat,"
2003,82,"the aim was song - the wind could see,"
2004,83,for every parcel i stoop down to seize
2005,83,"i lose some other off my arms and knees,"
2006,83,"and the whole pile is slipping, bottles, buns --"
2007,83,"extremes too hard to comprehend at once,"
2008,83,"yet nothing i should care to leave behind,"
2009,83,with all i have to hold with hand and mind
2010,83,"and heart, if need be, i will do my best"
2011,83,"to keep their building balanced at my breast,"
2012,83,i crouch down to prevent them as they fall;
2013,83,"then sit down in the middle of them all,"
2014,83,i had to drop the armful in the road
2015,83,"and try to stack them in a better load,"
2016,84,i've known ere now an interfering branch
2017,84,"of alder catch my lifted axe behind me,"
2018,84,"but that was in the woods, to hold my hand"
2019,84,"from striking at another alder's roots,"
2020,84,"and that was, as i say, an alder branch,"
2021,84,"this was a man, baptiste, who stole one day"
2022,84,behind me on the snow in my own yard
2023,84,"where i was working at the chopping block,"
2024,84,"and cutting nothing not cut down already,"
2025,84,"he caught my axe expertly on the rise,"
2026,84,"when all my strength put forth was in his favor,"
2027,84,"held it a moment where it was, to calm me,"
2028,84,"then took it from me -- and i let him take it,"
2029,84,i didn't know him well enough to know
2030,84,"what it was all about, there might be something"
2031,84,he had in mind to say to a bad neighbour
2032,84,"he might prefer to say to him disarmed,"
2033,84,but all he had to tell me in french-english
2034,84,"was what he thought of- not me, but my axe;"
2035,84,"me only as i took my axe to heart,"
2036,84,it was the bad axe-helve some one had sold me --
2037,84,"'made on machine,' he said, ploughing the grain"
2038,84,with a thick thumbnail to show how it ran
2039,84,"across the handle's long, drawn serpentine,"
2040,84,"like the two strokes across a dollar sign,"
2041,84,"'you give her 'one good crack, she's snap raght off,"
2042,84,den where's your hax-ead flying t'rough de hair?'
2043,84,"admitted; and yet, what was that to him?"
2044,84,'come on my house and i put you one in
2045,84,"what's las' awhile -- good hick'ry what's grow crooked,"
2046,84,"de second growt' i cut myself--tough, tough!'"
2047,84,
2048,84,"something to sell? that wasn't how it sounded,"
2049,84,
2050,84,"'den when you say you come? it's cost you nothing,"
2051,84,to-naght?'
2052,84,
2053,84,"as well to-night as any night,"
2054,84,
2055,84,beyond an over-warmth of kitchen stove
2056,84,"my welcome differed from no other welcome,"
2057,84,"baptiste knew best why i was where i was,"
2058,84,"so long as he would leave enough unsaid,"
2059,84,i shouldn't mind his being overjoyed
2060,84,if overjoyed he was at having got me
2061,84,where i must judge if what he knew about an axe
2062,84,that not everybody else knew was to count
2063,84,"for nothing in the measure of a neighbour,"
2064,84,"hard if, though cast away for life with yankees,"
2065,84,"a frenchman couldn't get his human rating,"
2066,84,
2067,84,"mrs, baptiste came in and rocked a chair"
2068,84,"that had as many motions as the world,"
2069,84,"one back and forward, in and out of shadow,"
2070,84,"that got her nowhere; one more gradual,"
2071,84,"sideways, that would have run her on the stove"
2072,84,"in time, had she not realized her danger"
2073,84,"and caught herself up bodily, chair and all,"
2074,84,"and set herself back where she, started from,"
2075,84,"'she ain't spick too much henglish- dat's too bad,'"
2076,84,"i was afraid, in brightening first on me,"
2077,84,"then on baptiste, as if she understood"
2078,84,"'what passed between us, she was only reigning,"
2079,84,baptiste was anxious for her; but no more
2080,84,"than for himself, so placed he couldn't hope"
2081,84,to keep his bargain of the morning with me
2082,84,in time to keep me from suspecting him
2083,84,"of really never having meant to keep it,"
2084,84,
2085,84,"needlessly soon he had his axe-helves out,"
2086,84,"a quiverful to choose from, since he wished me"
2087,84,"to have the best he had, or had to spare --"
2088,84,"not for me to ask which, when what he took"
2089,84,had beauties he had to point me out at length
2090,84,"to ensure their not being wasted on me,"
2091,84,"he liked to have it slender as a whipstock,"
2092,84,"free from the least knot, equal to the strain"
2093,84,"of bending like a sword across the knee,"
2094,84,he showed me that the lines of a good helve
2095,84,were native to the grain before the knife
2096,84,"expressed them, and its curves were no false curves"
2097,84,"put on it from without, and there its strength lay"
2098,84,"for the hard work, he chafed its long white body"
2099,84,"from end to end with his rough hand shut round it,"
2100,84,"he tried it at the eye-hold in the axe-head,"
2101,84,"'hahn, hahn,' he mused, 'don't need much taking down,'"
2102,84,baptiste knew how to make a short job long
2103,84,"for love of it, and yet not waste time either,"
2104,84,
2105,84,"do you know, what we talked about was knowledge?"
2106,84,baptiste on his defence about the children
2107,84,"he kept from school, or did his best to keep --"
2108,84,whatever school and children and our doubts
2109,84,of laid-on education had to do
2110,84,with the curves of his axe-helves and his having
2111,84,used these unscrupulously to bring me
2112,84,"to see for once the inside of his house,"
2113,84,"was i desired in friendship, partly as some one"
2114,84,"to leave it to, whether the right to hold"
2115,84,such doubts of education should depend
2116,84,"upon the education of those who held them,"
2117,84,but now he brushed the shavings from his knee
2118,84,"and stood the axe there on its horse's hoof,"
2119,84,"erect, but not without its waves, as when"
2120,84,the snake stood up for evil in the garden'-
2121,84,"top-heavy with a heaviness his short,"
2122,84,"thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down"
2123,84,"and in a little -- a french touch in that,"
2124,84,"baptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased;"
2125,84,"'see how she's cock her head,"
2126,85,the bear puts both arms around the tree above her
2127,85,and draws it down as if it were a lover
2128,85,"and its chokecherries lips to kiss good-by,"
2129,85,"then lets it snap back upright in the sky,"
2130,85,her next step rocks a boulder on the wall
2131,85,"she's making her cross-country in the fall,"
2132,85,her great weight creaks the barbed wire in its staples
2133,85,"as she flings over and off down through the maples,"
2134,85,"leaving on one wire tooth a lock of hair,"
2135,85,"such is the uncaged progress of the bear,"
2136,85,the world has room to make a bear feel free;
2137,85,"the universe seems cramped to you and me,"
2138,85,"man acts more like the poor bear in a cage,"
2139,85,"that all day fights a nervous inward rage,"
2140,85,"his mood rejecting all his mind suggests,"
2141,85,he paces back and forth and never rests
2142,85,"the me-nail click and shuffle of his feet,"
2143,85,"the telescope at one end of his beat,"
2144,85,"and at the other end the microscope,"
2145,85,"two instruments of nearly equal hope,"
2146,85,"and in conjunction giving quite a spread,"
2147,85,"or if he rests from scientific tread,"
2148,85,'tis only to sit back and sway his head
2149,85,"through ninety-odd degrees of arc, it seems,"
2150,85,"between two metaphysical extremes,"
2151,85,he sits back on his fundamental butt
2152,85,with lifted snout and eyes if any shut
2153,85,"he almost looks religious but he's not,"
2154,85,"and back and forth he sways from cheek to cheek,"
2155,85,at one extreme agreeing with one greek
2156,85,at the other agreeing with another greek
2157,85,"which may be thought, but only so to speak,"
2158,85,"a baggy figure, equally pathetic"
2159,85,"when sedentary and when peripatetic,"
2160,86,"oh, let’s go up the hill and scare ourselves,  "
2161,86,"as reckless as the best of them to-night,  "
2162,86,by setting fire to all the brush we piled  
2163,86,"with pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow,  "
2164,86,"oh, let’s not wait for rain to make it safe,    "
2165,86,"the pile is ours, we dragged it bough on bough  "
2166,86,"down dark converging paths between the pines,  "
2167,86,"let’s not care what we do with it to-night,  "
2168,86,divide it? no! but burn it as one pile  
2169,86,"the way we piled it, and let’s be the talk    "
2170,86,of people brought to windows by a light  
2171,86,"thrown from somewhere against their wall-paper,  "
2172,86,"rouse them all, both the free and not so free  "
2173,86,with saying what they’d like to do to us  
2174,86,"for what they’d better wait till we have done,    "
2175,86,"let’s all but bring to life this old volcano,  "
2176,86,if that is what the mountain ever was—  
2177,86,"and scare ourselves, let wild fire loose we will,,”  "
2178,86,
2179,86,"“and scare you too?” the children said together,  "
2180,86,
2181,86,“why wouldn’t it scare me to have a fire    
2182,86,begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know  
2183,86,"that still, if i repent, i may recall it,  "
2184,86,"but in a moment not, a little spurt  "
2185,86,"of burning fatness, and then nothing but  "
2186,86,"the fire itself can put it out, and that    "
2187,86,"by burning out, and before it burns out  "
2188,86,"it will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars,  "
2189,86,"and sweeping round it with a flaming sword,  "
2190,86,made the dim trees stand back in wider circle—  
2191,86,done so much and i know not how much more    
2192,86,"i mean it shall not do if i can bind it,  "
2193,86,well if it doesn’t with its draft bring on  
2194,86,"a wind to blow in earnest from some quarter,  "
2195,86,"as once it did with me upon an april,  "
2196,86,the breezes were so spent with winter blowing    
2197,86,they seemed to fail the bluebirds under them  
2198,86,short of the perch their languid flight was toward;  
2199,86,and my flame made a pinnacle to heaven  
2200,86,"as i walked once round it in possession,  "
2201,86,"but the wind out of doors—you know the saying,    "
2202,86,"there came a gust, you used to think the trees  "
2203,86,made wind by fanning since you never knew  
2204,86,"it blow but that you saw the trees in motion,  "
2205,86,"something or someone watching made that gust,  "
2206,86,it put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass    
2207,86,of over-winter with the least tip-touch  
2208,86,"your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand,  "
2209,86,"the place it reached to blackened instantly,  "
2210,86,"the black was all there was by day-light,  "
2211,86,that and the merest curl of cigarette smoke—    
2212,86,"and a flame slender as the hepaticas,  "
2213,86,"blood-root, and violets so soon to be now,  "
2214,86,"but the black spread like black death on the ground,  "
2215,86,and i think the sky darkened with a cloud  
2216,86,"like winter and evening coming on together,    "
2217,86,"there were enough things to be thought of then,  "
2218,86,where the field stretches toward the north  
2219,86,"and setting sun to hyla brook, i gave it  "
2220,86,"to flames without twice thinking, where it verges  "
2221,86,"upon the road, to flames too, though in fear    "
2222,86,"they might find fuel there, in withered brake,  "
2223,86,"grass its full length, old silver golden-rod,  "
2224,86,"and alder and grape vine entanglement,  "
2225,86,"to leap the dusty deadline, for my own  "
2226,86,"i took what front there was beside, i knelt    "
2227,86,"and thrust hands in and held my face away,  "
2228,86,"fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating,  "
2229,86,"a board is the best weapon if you have it,  "
2230,86,"i had my coat, and oh, i knew, i knew,  "
2231,86,"and said out loud, i couldn’t bide the smother    "
2232,86,and heat so close in; but the thought of all  
2233,86,"the woods and town on fire by me, and all  "
2234,86,"the town turned out to fight for me—that held me,  "
2235,86,"i trusted the brook barrier, but feared  "
2236,86,the road would fail; and on that side the fire    
2237,86,died not without a noise of crackling wood—  
2238,86,of something more than tinder-grass and weed—  
2239,86,that brought me to my feet to hold it back  
2240,86,"by leaning back myself, as if the reins  "
2241,86,"were round my neck and i was at the plough,    "
2242,86,i won! but i’m sure no one ever spread  
2243,86,another color over a tenth the space  
2244,86,that i spread coal-black over in the time  
2245,86,"it took me, neighbors coming home from town  "
2246,86,couldn’t believe that so much black had come there    
2247,86,"while they had backs turned, that it hadn’t been there  "
2248,86,when they had passed an hour or so before  
2249,86,"going the other way and they not seen it,  "
2250,86,"they looked about for someone to have done it,  "
2251,86,"but there was no one, i was somewhere wondering    "
2252,86,where all my weariness had gone and why  
2253,86,i walked so light on air in heavy shoes  
2254,86,"in spite of a scorched fourth-of-july feeling,  "
2255,86,why wouldn’t i be scared remembering that?”  
2256,86,
2257,86,"“if it scares you, what will it do to us?”    "
2258,86,
2259,86,"“scare you, but if you shrink from being scared,  "
2260,86,what would you say to war if it should come?  
2261,86,that’s what for reasons i should like to know—  
2262,86,"if you can comfort me by any answer,”  "
2263,86,
2264,86,"“oh, but war’s not for children—it’s for men,”  "
2265,86,
2266,86,"“now we are digging almost down to china,  "
2267,86,"my dears, my dears, you thought that—we all thought it,  "
2268,86,"so your mistake was ours, haven’t you heard, though,  "
2269,86,about the ships where war has found them out  
2270,86,"at sea, about the towns where war has come  "
2271,86,through opening clouds at night with droning speed  
2272,86,"further o’erhead than all but stars and angels,—  "
2273,86,and children in the ships and in the towns?  
2274,86,haven’t you heard what we have lived to learn?  
2275,86,"nothing so new—something we had forgotten,  "
2276,86,"war is for everyone, for children too,  "
2277,86,"i wasn’t going to tell you and i mustn’t,  "
2278,86,the best way is to come up hill with me  
2279,86,"and have our fire and laugh and be afraid,”"
2280,87,something inspires the only cow of late
2281,87,"to make no more of a wall than an open gate,"
2282,87,"and think no more of wall-builders than fools,"
2283,87,her face is flecked with pumice and she drools
2284,87,"a cider syrup, having tasted fruit,"
2285,87,"she scorns a pasture withering to the root,"
2286,87,"she runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten,"
2287,87,"the windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten,"
2288,87,"she leaves them bitten when she has to fly,"
2289,87,"she bellows on a knoll against the sky,"
2290,87,"her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry,"
2291,88,mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table
2292,88,"  waiting for warren, when she heard his step,"
2293,88,  she ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage
2294,88,  to meet him in the doorway with the news
2295,88,"  and put him on his guard, silas is back,"
2296,88,  she pushed him outward with her through the door
2297,88,"  and shut it after her, be kind, she said,"
2298,88,  she took the market things from warren's arms
2299,88,"  and set them on the porch, then drew him down"
2300,88," to sit beside her on the wooden steps,"
2301,88, when was i ever anything but kind to him?
2302,88," but i'll not have the fellow back, he said,"
2303,88," i told him so last haying, didn't i?"
2304,88," 'if he left then,' i said, 'that ended it,'"
2305,88, what good is he? who else will harbour him
2306,88, at his age for the little he can do?
2307,88," what help he is there's no depending on,"
2308,88," off he goes always when i need him most,"
2309,88," 'he thinks he ought to earn a little pay,"
2310,88," enough at least to buy tobacco with,"
2311,88," so he won't have to beg and be beholden,'"
2312,88," 'all right,' i say, 'i can't afford to pay"
2313,88," any fixed wages, though i wish i could,'"
2314,88," 'someone else can,' 'then someone else will have to,'"
2315,88, i shouldn't mind his bettering himself
2316,88," if that was what it was, you can be certain,"
2317,88," when he begins like that, there's someone at him"
2318,88," trying to coax him off with pocket-money,--"
2319,88," in haying time, when any help is scarce,"
2320,88," in winter he comes back to us, i'm done,"
2321,88," sh! not so loud, he'll hear you, mary said,"
2322,88," i want him to, he'll have to soon or late,"
2323,88," he's worn out, he's asleep beside the stove,"
2324,88," when i came up from rowe's i found him here,"
2325,88," huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,"
2326,88," a miserable sight, and frightening, too--"
2327,88, you needn't smile--i didn't recognise him--
2328,88," i wasn't looking for him--and he's changed,"
2329,88," wait till you see,"
2330,88,           where did you say he'd been?
2331,88," he didn't say, i dragged him to the house,"
2332,88," and gave him tea and tried to make him smoke,"
2333,88," i tried to make him talk about his travels,"
2334,88," nothing would do, he just kept nodding off,"
2335,88, what did he say? did he say anything?
2336,88," but little,"
2337,88,"           anything? mary, confess"
2338,88," he said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me,"
2339,88, warren!
2340,88,"           but did he? i just want to know,"
2341,88," of course he did, what would you have him say?"
2342,88, surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man
2343,88," some humble way to save his self-respect,"
2344,88," he added, if you really care to know,"
2345,88," he meant to clear the upper pasture, too,"
2346,88, that sounds like something you have heard before?
2347,88," warren, i wish you could have heard the way"
2348,88," he jumbled everything, i stopped to look"
2349,88, two or three times--he made me feel so queer--
2350,88," to see if he was talking in his sleep,"
2351,88, he ran on harold wilson--you remember--
2352,88," the boy you had in haying four years since,"
2353,88," he's finished school, and teaching in his college,"
2354,88," silas declares you'll have to get him back,"
2355,88," he says they two will make a team for work,"
2356,88, between them they will lay this farm as smooth!
2357,88," the way he mixed that in with other things,"
2358,88," he thinks young wilson a likely lad, though daft"
2359,88, on education--you know how they fought
2360,88," all through july under the blazing sun,"
2361,88," silas up on the cart to build the load,"
2362,88," harold along beside to pitch it on,"
2363,88," yes, i took care to keep well out of earshot,"
2364,88," well, those days trouble silas like a dream,"
2365,88," you wouldn't think they would, how some things linger!"
2366,88," harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him,"
2367,88, after so many years he still keeps finding
2368,88," good arguments he sees he might have used,"
2369,88," i sympathise, i know just how it feels"
2370,88," to think of the right thing to say too late,"
2371,88," harold's associated in his mind with latin,"
2372,88, he asked me what i thought of harold's saying
2373,88, he studied latin like the violin
2374,88, because he liked it--that an argument!
2375,88, he said he couldn't make the boy believe
2376,88, he could find water with a hazel prong--
2377,88," which showed how much good school had ever done him,"
2378,88," he wanted to go over that, but most of all"
2379,88, he thinks if he could have another chance
2380,88, to teach him how to build a load of hay----
2381,88," i know, that's silas' one accomplishment,"
2382,88," he bundles every forkful in its place,"
2383,88," and tags and numbers it for future reference,"
2384,88, so he can find and easily dislodge it
2385,88," in the unloading, silas does that well,"
2386,88," he takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests,"
2387,88, you never see him standing on the hay
2388,88," he's trying to lift, straining to lift himself,"
2389,88," he thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be"
2390,88,"some good perhaps to someone in the world,"
2391,88,"he hates to see a boy the fool of books,"
2392,88,"poor silas, so concerned for other folk,"
2393,88,"and nothing to look backward to with pride,"
2394,88,"and nothing to look forward to with hope,"
2395,88,"so now and never any different,"
2396,88,"part of a moon was falling down the west,"
2397,88,"dragging the whole sky with it to the hills,"
2398,88,"its light poured softly in her lap, she saw"
2399,88,"and spread her apron to it, she put out her hand"
2400,88,"among the harp-like morning-glory strings,"
2401,88,"taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,"
2402,88,as if she played unheard the tenderness
2403,88,"that wrought on him beside her in the night,"
2404,88,"warren, she said, he has come home to die,"
2405,88,"you needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time,"
2406,88,"home, he mocked gently,"
2407,88,"          yes, what else but home?"
2408,88,"it all depends on what you mean by home,"
2409,88,"of course he's nothing to us, any more"
2410,88,than was the hound that came a stranger to us
2411,88,"out of the woods, worn out upon the trail,"
2412,88,"home is the place where, when you have to go there,"
2413,88,"they have to take you in,"
2414,88,          i should have called it
2415,88,"something you somehow haven't to deserve,"
2416,88,"warren leaned out and took a step or two,"
2417,88,"picked up a little stick, and brought it back"
2418,88,"and broke it in his hand and tossed it by,"
2419,88,silas has better claim on us you think
2420,88,than on his brother? thirteen little miles
2421,88,"as the road winds would bring him to his door,"
2422,88,"silas has walked that far no doubt to-day,"
2423,88,"why didn't he go there? his brother's rich,"
2424,88,"a somebody--director in the bank,"
2425,88,"he never told us that,"
2426,88,"          we know it though,"
2427,88,"i think his brother ought to help, of course,"
2428,88,"i'll see to that if there is need, he ought of right"
2429,88,"to take him in, and might be willing to--"
2430,88,"he may be better than appearances,"
2431,88,"but have some pity on silas, do you think"
2432,88,if he'd had any pride in claiming kin
2433,88,"or anything he looked for from his brother,"
2434,88,he'd keep so still about him all this time?
2435,88,"i wonder what's between them,"
2436,88,"          i can tell you,"
2437,88,silas is what he is--we wouldn't mind him--
2438,88,"but just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide,"
2439,88,"he never did a thing so very bad,"
2440,88,he don't know why he isn't quite as good
2441,88,"as anyone, he won't be made ashamed"
2442,88,"to please his brother, worthless though he is,"
2443,88,"i can't think si ever hurt anyone,"
2444,88,"no, but he hurt my heart the way he lay"
2445,88,"and rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back,"
2446,88,"he wouldn't let me put him on the lounge,"
2447,88,"you must go in and see what you can do,"
2448,88,"i made the bed up for him there to-night,"
2449,88,"you'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken,"
2450,88,"his working days are done; i'm sure of it,"
2451,88,"i'd not be in a hurry to say that,"
2452,88,"i haven't been, go, look, see for yourself,"
2453,88,"but, warren, please remember how it is,"
2454,88,"he's come to help you ditch the meadow,"
2455,88,"he has a plan, you mustn't laugh at him,"
2456,88,"he may not speak of it, and then he may,"
2457,88,i'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud
2458,88,"will hit or miss the moon,"
2459,88,"          it hit the moon,"
2460,88,"then there were three there, making a dim row,"
2461,88,"the moon, the little silver cloud, and she,"
2462,88,"warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her,"
2463,88,"slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited,"
2464,88,"warren, she questioned,"
2465,88,"          dead, was all he answered,"
2466,89,it was far in the sameness of the wood;
2467,89,"i was running with joy on the demon's trail,"
2468,89,"though i knew what i hunted was no true god,"
2469,89,i was just as the light was beginning to fail
2470,89,"that i suddenly head--all i needed to hear,"
2471,89,"it has lasted me many and many a year,"
2472,89,
2473,89,"the sound was behind me instead of before,"
2474,89,"a sleepy sound, but mocking half,"
2475,89,"as one who utterly couldn't care,"
2476,89,"the demon arose from his wallow to laugh,"
2477,89,brushing the dirt from his eye as he went;
2478,89,"and well i knew what the demon meant,"
2479,89,
2480,89,"i shall not forget how his laugh rang out,"
2481,89,"i felt as a fool to have been so caught,"
2482,89,and checked my steps to make pretense
2483,89,i was something among the leaves i sought
2484,89,"though doubtful whether he stayed to see,"
2485,89,"thereafter i sat me against a tree,"
2486,90,"you were forever finding some new play,"
2487,90,so when i saw you down on hands and knees
2488,90,"i the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay,"
2489,90,"trying, i thought, to set it up on end,"
2490,90,"i went to show you how to make it stay,"
2491,90,"if that was your idea, against the breeze,"
2492,90,"and, if you asked me, even help pretend"
2493,90,"to make it root again and grow afresh,"
2494,90,"but 'twas no make-believe with you today,"
2495,90,"nor was the grass itself your real concern,"
2496,90,"though i found your hand full of wilted fern,"
2497,90,"steel-bright june-grass, and blackening heads of clovers,"
2498,90,'twas a nest full of young birds on the ground
2499,90,the cutter-bar had just gone champing over
2500,90,miraculously without tasking flesh
2501,90,"and left defenseless to the heat and light,"
2502,90,you wanted to restore them to their right
2503,90,of something interposed between their sight
2504,90,"and too much world at once--could means be found,"
2505,90,the way the nest-full every time we stirred
2506,90,stood up to us as to a mother-bird
2507,90,"whose coming home has been too long deferred,"
2508,90,made me ask would the mother-bird return
2509,90,and care for them in such a change of scene
2510,90,"and might out meddling make her more afraid,"
2511,90,"that was a thing we could not wait to learn,"
2512,90,"we saw the risk we took in doing good,"
2513,90,but dared not spare to do the best we could
2514,90,though harm should come of it; so built the screen
2515,90,"you had begun, and gave them back their shade,"
2516,90,"all this to prove we cared, why is there then"
2517,90,"no more to tell? we turned to other things,"
2518,90,i haven't any memory--have you?--
2519,90,of ever coming to the place again
2520,90,"to see if the birds lived the first night through,"
2521,90,"and so at last to learn to use their wings,"
2522,91,the fisherman's swapping a yarn for a yarn
2523,91,"under the hand of the village barber,"
2524,91,and her in the angle of house and barn
2525,91,"his deep-sea dory has found a harbor,"
2526,91,
2527,91,at anchor she rides the sunny sod
2528,91,as full to the gunnel of flowers growing
2529,91,as ever she turned her home with cod
2530,91,"from george's bank when winds were blowing,"
2531,91,
2532,91,and i judge from that elysian freight
2533,91,"that all they ask is rougher weather,"
2534,91,and dory and master will sail by fate
2535,91,"to seek the happy isles together,"
2536,92,"the land was ours before we were the land's,"
2537,92,she was our land more than a hundred years
2538,92,"before we were her people, she was ours"
2539,92,"in massachusetts, in virginia,"
2540,92,"but we were england's, still colonials,"
2541,92,"possessing what we still were unpossessed by,"
2542,92,"possessed by what we now no more possessed,"
2543,92,something we were withholding made us weak
2544,92,until we found out that it was ourselves
2545,92,"we were withholding from our land of living,"
2546,92,"and forthwith found salvation in surrender,"
2547,92,such as we were we gave ourselves outright
2548,92,the deed of gift was many deeds of war
2549,92,"to the land vaguely realizing westward,"
2550,92,"but still unstoried, artless, unenhanced,"
2551,92,"such as she was, such as she would become,"
2552,93,there overtook me and drew me in
2553,93,"to his down-hill, early-morning stride,"
2554,93,and set me five miles on my road
2555,93,"better than if he had had me ride,"
2556,93,a man with a swinging bag for'load
2557,93,"and half the bag wound round his hand,"
2558,93,we talked like barking above the din
2559,93,"of water we walked along beside,"
2560,93,and for my telling him where i'd been
2561,93,and where i lived in mountain land
2562,93,"to be coming home the way i was,"
2563,93,"he told me a little about himself,"
2564,93,he came from higher up in the pass
2565,93,where the grist of the new-beginning brooks
2566,93,is blocks split off the mountain mass --
2567,93,"and hop, eless grist enough it looks"
2568,93,"ever to grind to soil for grass,"
2569,93,"the way it is will do for moss,"
2570,93,"there he had built his stolen shack,"
2571,93,it had to be a stolen shack
2572,93,because of the fears of fire and logs
2573,93,"that trouble the sleep of lumber folk,"
2574,93,visions of half the world burned black
2575,93,"and the sun shrunken yellow in smoke,"
2576,93,we know who when they come to town
2577,93,"bring berries under the wagon seat,"
2578,93,or a basket of eggs between their feet;
2579,93,what this man brought in a cotton sack
2580,93,"was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce,"
2581,93,he showed me lumps of the scented stuff
2582,93,"like uncut jewels, dull and rough"
2583,93,it comes to market golden brown;
2584,93,"but turns to pink between the teeth,"
2585,93,i told him this is a pleasant life
2586,93,to set your breast to the bark of trees
2587,93,"that all your days are dim beneath,"
2588,93,"and reaching up with a little knife,"
2589,93,to loose the resin and take it down
2590,93,and bring it to market when you please
2591,94,"it was too lonely for her there,"
2592,94,"and too wild,"
2593,94,"and since there were but two of them,"
2594,94,"and no child,"
2595,94,
2596,94,"and work was little in the house,"
2597,94,"she was free,"
2598,94,"and followed where he furrowed field,"
2599,94,"or felled log,"
2600,94,
2601,94,she rested on a log and tossed
2602,94,"the fresh chips,"
2603,94,with a song only to herself
2604,94,"on her lips,"
2605,94,
2606,94,and once she went to break a bough
2607,94,"of black alder,"
2608,94,she strayed so far she scarcely heard
2609,94,when he called her -
2610,94,
2611,94,and didn't answer - didn't speak -
2612,94,"or return,"
2613,94,"she stood, and then she ran and hid"
2614,94,"in the fern,"
2615,94,
2616,94,"he never found her, though he looked"
2617,94,"everywhere,"
2618,94,and he asked at her mother's house
2619,94,"was she there,"
2620,94,
2621,94,sudden and swift and light as that
2622,94,"the ties gave,"
2623,94,and he learned of finalities
2624,94,"besides the grave,"
2625,95,"here come the line-gang pioneering by,"
2626,95,"they throw a forest down less cut than broken,"
2627,95,"they plant dead trees for living, and the dead"
2628,95,"they string together with a living thread,"
2629,95,they string an instrument against the sky
2630,95,wherein words whether beaten out or spoken
2631,95,will run as hushed as when they were a thought
2632,95,"but in no hush they string it, they go past"
2633,95,"with shouts afar to pull the cable taught,"
2634,95,"to hold it hard until they make it fast,"
2635,95,"to ease away -- they have it, with a laugh,"
2636,95,an oath of towns that set the wild at naught
2637,95,"they bring the telephone and telegraph,"
2638,96,"it went many years,"
2639,96,"but at last came a knock,"
2640,96,and i thought of the door
2641,96,"with no lock to lock,"
2642,96,
2643,96,"i blew out the light,"
2644,96,"i tip-toed the floor,"
2645,96,and raised both hands
2646,96,"in prayer to the door,"
2647,96,
2648,96,but the knock came again
2649,96,my window was wide;
2650,96,i climbed on the sill
2651,96,"and descended outside,"
2652,96,
2653,96,back over the sill
2654,96,i bade a come in
2655,96,to whoever the knock
2656,96,"at the door may have been,"
2657,96,
2658,96,so at a knock
2659,96,i emptied my cage
2660,96,to hide in the world
2661,96,"and alter with age,"
2662,97,the house had gone to bring again
2663,97,"to the midnight sky a sunset glow,"
2664,97,"now the chimney was all of the house that stood,"
2665,97,"like a pistil after the petals go,"
2666,97,
2667,97,"the barn opposed across the way,"
2668,97,that would have joined the house in flame
2669,97,"had it been the will of the wind, was left"
2670,97,"to bear forsaken the place's name,"
2671,97,
2672,97,no more it opened with all one end
2673,97,for teams that came by the stony road
2674,97,to drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs
2675,97,"and brush the mow with the summer load,"
2676,97,
2677,97,the birds that came to it through the air
2678,97,"at broken windows flew out and in,"
2679,97,their murmur more like the sigh we sigh
2680,97,"from too much dwelling on what has been,"
2681,97,
2682,97,"yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf,"
2683,97,"and the aged elm, though touched with fire;"
2684,97,and the dry pump flung up an awkward arm;
2685,97,"and the fence post carried a strand of wire,"
2686,97,
2687,97,"for them there was really nothing sad,"
2688,97,"but though they rejoiced in the nest they kept,"
2689,97,one had to be versed in country things
2690,97,"not to believe the phoebes wept,"
2691,98,at the end of the row
2692,98,i stepped on the toe
2693,98,"of an unemployed hoe,"
2694,98,it rose in offense
2695,98,and struck me a blow
2696,98,"in the seat of my sense,"
2697,98,it wasn't to blame
2698,98,"but i called it a name,"
2699,98,and i must say it dealt
2700,98,me a blow that i felt
2701,98,"like a malice prepense,"
2702,98,"you may call me a fool,"
2703,98,but was there a rule
2704,98,the weapon should be
2705,98,turned into a tool?
2706,98,and what do we see?
2707,98,the first tool i step on
2708,98,"turned into a weapon,"
2709,99,"there is a singer everyone has heard,"
2710,99,"  loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,"
2711,99,"  who makes the solid tree trunks sound again,"
2712,99,  he says that leaves are old and that for flowers
2713,99,"  mid-summer is to spring as one to ten,"
2714,99,  he says the early petal-fall is past
2715,99,  when pear and cherry bloom went down in showers
2716,99,  on sunny days a moment overcast;
2717,99,"  and comes that other fall we name the fall,"
2718,99," he says the highway dust is over all,"
2719,99, the bird would cease and be as other birds
2720,99," but that he knows in singing not to sing,"
2721,99, the question that he frames in all but words
2722,99," is what to make of a diminished thing,"
2723,100,i'm going out to clean the pasture spring;
2724,100,  i'll only stop to rake the leaves away
2725,100,"  and wait to watch the water clear, i may,"
2726,100,"  i sha'n't be gone long,--you come too,"
2727,100,  i'm going out to fetch the little calf
2728,100,"  that's standing by the mother, it's so young,"
2729,100,"  it totters when she licks it with her tongue,"
2730,100,"  i sha'n't be gone long,--you come too,"
2731,101,"two roads diverged in a yellow wood,"
2732,101,  and sorry i could not travel both
2733,101,"  and be one traveler, long i stood"
2734,101,  and looked down one as far as i could
2735,101,  to where it bent in the undergrowth;
2736,101,"  then took the other, as just as fair,"
2737,101,"  and having perhaps the better claim,"
2738,101,  because it was grassy and wanted wear;
2739,101,  though as for that the passing there
2740,101," had worn them really about the same,"
2741,101, and both that morning equally lay
2742,101," in leaves no step had trodden black,"
2743,101," oh, i kept the first for another day!"
2744,101," yet knowing how way leads on to way,"
2745,101," i doubted if i should ever come back,"
2746,101, i shall be telling this with a sigh
2747,101," somewhere ages and ages hence,"
2748,101," two roads diverged in a wood, and i--"
2749,101," i took the one less traveled by,"
2750,101," and that has made all the difference,"
2751,102,"the rose is a rose,"
2752,102,"and was always a rose,"
2753,102,but the theory now goes
2754,102,"that the apple's a rose,"
2755,102,"and the pear is, and so's"
2756,102,"the plum, i suppose,"
2757,102,the dear only knows
2758,102,"what will next prove a rose,"
2759,102,"you, of course, are a rose -"
2760,102,"but were always a rose,"
2761,103,"we dance round in a ring and suppose,"
2762,103,"but the secret sits in the middle and knows,"
2763,104,she is as in a field of silken tent
2764,104,at midday when the sunny summer breeze
2765,104,"has dried the dew and all its ropes relent,"
2766,104,"so that in guys it gently sways at ease,"
2767,104,"and its supporting central cedar pole,"
2768,104,that is its pinnacle to heavenward
2769,104,"and signifies the sureness of the soul,"
2770,104,"seems to owe naught to any single cord,"
2771,104,"but strictly held by none, is loosely bound"
2772,104,by countless silken ties of love and thought
2773,104,"to every thing on earth the compass round,"
2774,104,and only by one's going slightly taut
2775,104,in the capriciousness of summer air
2776,104,"is of the slightlest bondage made aware,"
2777,105,"he is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,"
2778,105,"that lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,"
2779,105,"but still lies pointed as it ploughed the dust,"
2780,105,"if we who sight along it round the world,"
2781,105,"see nothing worthy to have been its mark,"
2782,105,"it is because like men we look too near,"
2783,105,"forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,"
2784,105,"our missiles always make too short an arc,"
2785,105,"they fall, they rip the grass, they intersect"
2786,105,"the curve of earth, and striking, break their own;"
2787,105,"they make us cringe for metal-point on stone,"
2788,105,"but this we know, the obstacle that checked"
2789,105,"and tripped the body, shot the spirit on"
2790,105,"further than target ever showed or shone,"
2791,106,"i wonder about the trees,"
2792,106,why do we wish to bear
2793,106,forever the noise of these
2794,106,more than another noise
2795,106,so close to our dwelling place?
2796,106,we suffer them by the day
2797,106,"till we lose all measure of pace,"
2798,106,"and fixity in our joys,"
2799,106,"and acquire a listening air,"
2800,106,they are that that talks of going
2801,106,but never gets away;
2802,106,"and that talks no less for knowing,"
2803,106,"as it grows wiser and older,"
2804,106,"that now it means to stay,"
2805,106,my feet tug at the floor
2806,106,and my head sways to my shoulder
2807,106,"sometimes when i watch trees sway,"
2808,106,"from the window or the door,"
2809,106,"i shall set forth for somewhere,"
2810,106,i shall make the reckless choice
2811,106,some day when they are in voice
2812,106,and tossing so as to scare
2813,106,"the white clouds over them on,"
2814,106,"i shall have less to say,"
2815,106,"but i shall be gone,"
2816,107,"the old dog barks backwards without getting up,"
2817,107,"i can remember when he was a pup,"
2818,108,"`you know orion always comes up sideways,"
2819,108,"throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,"
2820,108,"and rising on his hands, he looks in on me"
2821,108,busy outdoors by lantern-light with something
2822,108,"i should have done by daylight, and indeed,"
2823,108,"after the ground is frozen, i should have done"
2824,108,"before it froze, and a gust flings a handful"
2825,108,of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney
2826,108,"to make fun of my way of doing things,"
2827,108,"or else fun of orion's having caught me,"
2828,108,"has a man, i should like to ask, no rights"
2829,108,these forces are obliged to pay respect to?'
2830,108,so brad mclaughlin mingled reckless talk
2831,108,"of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,"
2832,108,till having failed at hugger-mugger farming
2833,108,he burned his house down for the fire insurance
2834,108,and spent the proceeds on a telescope
2835,108,to satisfy a lifelong curiosity
2836,108,"about our place among the infinities,"
2837,108,
2838,108,`what do you want with one of those blame things?'
2839,108,"i asked him well beforehand, `don't you get one!'"
2840,108,
2841,108,`don't call it blamed; there isn't anything
2842,108,more blameless in the sense of being less
2843,108,"a weapon in our human fight,' he said,"
2844,108,"`i'll have one if i sell my farm to buy it,'"
2845,108,there where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
2846,108,"and plowed between the rocks he couldn't move,"
2847,108,few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years
2848,108,"trying to sell his farm and then not selling,"
2849,108,he burned his house down for the fire insurance
2850,108,"and bought the telescope with what it came to,"
2851,108,"he had been heard to say by several,"
2852,108,`the best thing that we're put here for's to see;
2853,108,the strongest thing that's given us to see with's
2854,108,"a telescope, someone in every town"
2855,108,"seems to me owes it to the town to keep one,"
2856,108,"in littleton it might as well be me,'"
2857,108,after such loose talk it was no surprise
2858,108,"when he did what he did and burned his house down,"
2859,108,
2860,108,mean laughter went about the town that day
2861,108,"to let him know we weren't the least imposed on,"
2862,108,"and he could wait---we'd see to him tomorrow,"
2863,108,but the first thing next morning we reflected
2864,108,if one by one we counted people out
2865,108,"for the least sin, it wouldn't take us long"
2866,108,"to get so we had no one left to live with,"
2867,108,"for to be social is to be forgiving,"
2868,108,"our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,"
2869,108,"we don't cut off from coming to church suppers,"
2870,108,"but what we miss we go to him and ask for,"
2871,108,"he promptly gives it back, that is if still"
2872,108,"uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of,"
2873,108,it wouldn't do to be too hard on brad
2874,108,"about his telescope, beyond the age"
2875,108,"of being given one for christmas gift,"
2876,108,he had to take the best way he knew how
2877,108,"to find himself in one, well, all we said was"
2878,108,"he took a strange thing to be roguish over,"
2879,108,"some sympathy was wasted on the house,"
2880,108,a good old-timer dating back along;
2881,108,but a house isn't sentient; the house
2882,108,"didn't feel anything, and if it did,"
2883,108,"why not regard it as a sacrifice,"
2884,108,"and an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,"
2885,108,instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?
2886,108,
2887,108,out of a house and so out of a farm
2888,108,"at one stroke of a match, brad had to turn"
2889,108,"to earn a living on the concord railroad,"
2890,108,as under-ticket-agent at a station
2891,108,"where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets,"
2892,108,"was setting out, up track and down, not plants"
2893,108,"as on a farm, but planets, evening stars"
2894,108,"that varied in their hue from red to green,"
2895,108,
2896,108,"he got a good glass for six hundred dollars,"
2897,108,"his new job gave him leisure for stargazing,"
2898,108,often he bid me come and have a look
2899,108,"up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,"
2900,108,"at a star quaking in the other end,"
2901,108,i recollect a night of broken clouds
2902,108,"and underfoot snow melted down to ice,"
2903,108,"and melting further in the wind to mud,"
2904,108,"bradford and i had out the telescope,"
2905,108,"we spread our two legs as we spread its three,"
2906,108,"pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,"
2907,108,"and standing at our leisure till the day broke,"
2908,108,"said some of the best things we ever said,"
2909,108,"that telescope was christened the star-splitter,"
2910,108,because it didn't do a thing but split
2911,108,"a star in two or three, the way you split"
2912,108,a globule of quicksilver in your hand
2913,108,"with one stroke of your finger in the middle,"
2914,108,"it's a star-splitter if there ever was one,"
2915,108,and ought to do some good if splitting stars
2916,108,"'sad thing to be compared with splitting wood,"
2917,108,
2918,108,"we've looked and looked, but after all where are we?"
2919,108,"do we know any better where we are,"
2920,108,and how it stands between the night tonight
2921,108,and a man with a smoky lantern chimney?
2922,108,how different from the way it ever stood?
2923,109,'when i was just as far as i could walk
2924,109,"from here today,"
2925,109,there was an hour
2926,109,all still
2927,109,when leaning with my head again a flower
2928,109,"i heard you talk,"
2929,109,"don't say i didn't, for i heard you say--"
2930,109,you spoke from that flower on the window sill-
2931,109,do you remember what it was you said?'
2932,109,
2933,109,"'first tell me what it was you thought you heard,'"
2934,109,
2935,109,"'having found the flower and driven a bee away,"
2936,109,i leaned on my head
2937,109,"and holding by the stalk,"
2938,109,i listened and i thought i caught the word--
2939,109,what was it?  did you call me by my name?
2940,109,or did you say--
2941,109,"someone said come -- i heard it as i bowed,'"
2942,109,
2943,109,"'i may have thought as much, but not aloud,'"
2944,109,
2945,109,"well, so i came,'"
2946,110,even the bravest that are slain
2947,110, shall not dissemble their surprise
2948,110,"on waking to find valor reign,"
2949,110," even as on earth, in paradise;"
2950,110,and where they sought without the sword
2951,110," wide fields of asphodel fore'er,"
2952,110,to find that the utmost reward
2953,110," of daring should be still to dare,"
2954,110,
2955,110,the light of heaven falls whole and white
2956,110," and is not shattered into dyes,"
2957,110,the light forever is morning light;
2958,110, the hills are verdured pasture-wise;
2959,110,"the angle hosts with freshness go,"
2960,110, and seek with laughter what to brave;--
2961,110,and binding all is the hushed snow
2962,110," of the far-distant breaking wave,"
2963,110,
2964,110,and from a cliff-top is proclaimed
2965,110," the gathering of the souls for birth,"
2966,110,"the trial by existence named,"
2967,110," the obscuration upon earth,"
2968,110,and the slant spirits trooping by
2969,110, in streams and cross- and counter-streams
2970,110,can but give ear to that sweet cry
2971,110, for its suggestion of what dreams!
2972,110,
2973,110,and the more loitering are turned
2974,110, to view once more the sacrifice
2975,110,of those who for some good discerned
2976,110," will gladly give up paradise,"
2977,110,and a white shimmering concourse rolls
2978,110, toward the throne to witness there
2979,110,the speeding of devoted souls
2980,110," which god makes his especial care,"
2981,110,
2982,110,"and none are taken but who will,"
2983,110, having first heard the life read out
2984,110,"that opens earthward, good and ill,"
2985,110, beyond the shadow of a doubt;
2986,110,"and very beautifully god limns,"
2987,110," and tenderly, life's little dream,"
2988,110,"but naught extenuates or dims,"
2989,110," setting the thing that is supreme,"
2990,110,
2991,110,nor is there wanting in the press
2992,110," some spirit to stand simply forth,"
2993,110,"heroic in it nakedness,"
2994,110," against the uttermost of earth,"
2995,110,the tale of earth's unhonored things
2996,110, sounds nobler there than 'neath the sun;
2997,110,"and the mind whirls and the heart sings,"
2998,110," and a shout greets the daring one,"
2999,110,
3000,110,"but always god speaks at the end,"
3001,110, 'one thought in agony of strife
3002,110,"the bravest would have by for friend,"
3003,110, the memory that he chose the life;
3004,110,but the pure fate to which you go
3005,110," admits no memory of choice,"
3006,110,or the woe were not earthly woe
3007,110," to which you give the assenting voice,'"
3008,110,
3009,110,"and so the choice must be again,"
3010,110, but the last choice is still the same;
3011,110,"and the awe passes wonder then,"
3012,110," and a hush falls for all acclaim,"
3013,110,and god has taken a flower of gold
3014,110," and broken it, and used therefrom"
3015,110,the mystic link to bind and hold
3016,110," spirit to matter till death come,"
3017,110,
3018,110,"'tis of the essence of life here,"
3019,110," though we choose greatly, still to lack"
3020,110,"the lasting memory at all clear,"
3021,110, that life has for us on the wrack
3022,110,nothing but what we somehow chose;
3023,110, thus are we wholly stripped of pride
3024,110,"in the pain that has but one close,"
3025,110," bearing it crushed and mystified,"
3026,111,i went to turn the grass once after one
3027,111,"  who mowed it in the dew before the sun,"
3028,111,  the dew was gone that made his blade so keen
3029,111,"  before i came to view the levelled scene,"
3030,111,  i looked for him behind an isle of trees;
3031,111,"  i listened for his whetstone on the breeze,"
3032,111,"  but he had gone his way, the grass all mown,"
3033,111,"  and i must be, as he had been,--alone,"
3034,111,"  `as all must be,' i said within my heart,"
3035,111," `whether they work together or apart,'"
3036,111,
3037,111," but as i said it, swift there passed me by"
3038,111," on noiseless wing a 'wildered butterfly,"
3039,111,
3040,111, seeking with memories grown dim o'er night
3041,111," some resting flower of yesterday's delight,"
3042,111,
3043,111," and once i marked his flight go round and round,"
3044,111," as where some flower lay withering on the ground,"
3045,111,
3046,111," and then he flew as far as eye could see,"
3047,111," and then on tremulous wing came back to me,"
3048,111,
3049,111," i thought of questions that have no reply,"
3050,111, and would have turned to toss the grass to dry;
3051,111,
3052,111," but he turned first, and led my eye to look"
3053,111," at a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,"
3054,111,
3055,111, a leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
3056,111," beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared,"
3057,111,
3058,111," i left my place to know them by their name,"
3059,111," finding them butterfly weed when i came,"
3060,111,
3061,111," the mower in the dew had loved them thus,"
3062,111," by leaving them to flourish, not for us,"
3063,111,
3064,111," nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him,"
3065,111," but from sheer morning gladness at the brim,"
3066,111,
3067,111," the butterfly and i had lit upon,"
3068,111," nevertheless, a message from the dawn,"
3069,111,
3070,111," that made me hear the wakening birds around,"
3071,111," and hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,"
3072,111,
3073,111, and feel a spirit kindred to my own;
3074,111, so that henceforth i worked no more alone;
3075,111,
3076,111," but glad with him, i worked as with his aid,"
3077,111," and weary, sought at noon with him the shade;"
3078,111,
3079,111," and dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech"
3080,111," with one whose thought i had not hoped to reach,"
3081,111,
3082,111," `men work together,' i told him from the heart,"
3083,111," `whether they work together or apart,'"
3084,112,he is said to have been the last red man
3085,112,"in action, and the miller is said to have laughed--"
3086,112,"if you like to call such a sound a laugh,"
3087,112,"but he gave no one else a laugher's license,"
3088,112,"for he turned suddenly grave as if to say,"
3089,112,"'whose business,--if i take it on myself,"
3090,112,whose business--but why talk round the barn?--
3091,112,"when it's just that i hold with getting a thing done with,'"
3092,112,"you can't get back and see it as he saw it,"
3093,112,"it's too long a story to go into now,"
3094,112,"you'd have to have been there and lived it,"
3095,112,they you wouldn't have looked on it as just a matter
3096,112,"of who began it between the two races,"
3097,112,
3098,112,some guttural exclamation of surprise
3099,112,the red man gave in poking about the mill
3100,112,over the great big thumping shuffling millstone
3101,112,disgusted the miller physically as coming
3102,112,"from one who had no right to be heard from,"
3103,112,"'come, john,' he said, 'you want to see the wheel-pint?'"
3104,112,
3105,112,"he took him down below a cramping rafter,"
3106,112,"and showed him, through a manhole in the floor,"
3107,112,"the water in desperate straits like frantic fish,"
3108,112,"salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails,"
3109,112,the he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
3110,112,"that jangled even above the general noise,"
3111,112,"and came upstairs alone--and gave that laugh,"
3112,112,and said something to a man with a meal-sack
3113,112,"that the man with the meal-sack didn't catch--then,"
3114,112,"oh, yes, he showed john the wheel-pit all right,"
3115,113,"if tires of trees i seek again mankind,"
3116,113,"well i know where to hie me--in the dawn,"
3117,113,"to a slope where the cattle keep the lawn,"
3118,113,"there amid loggin juniper reclined,"
3119,113,"myself unseen, i see in white defined"
3120,113,"far off the homes of men, and farther still,"
3121,113,"the graves of men on an opposing hill,"
3122,113,"living or dead, whichever are to mind,"
3123,113,
3124,113,"and if by noon i have too much of these,"
3125,113,"i have but to turn on my arm, and lo,"
3126,113,"the sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow,"
3127,113,"my breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze,"
3128,113,"i smell the earth, i smell the bruisèd plant,"
3129,113,"i look into the crater of the ant,"
3130,114,out walking in the frozen swamp one grey day
3131,114,"  i paused and said, i will turn back from here,"
3132,114,"  no, i will go on farther--and we shall see,"
3133,114,"  the hard snow held me, save where now and then"
3134,114,"  one foot went down, the view was all in lines"
3135,114,  straight up and down of tall slim trees
3136,114,  too much alike to mark or name a place by
3137,114,  so as to say for certain i was here
3138,114,"  or somewhere else, i was just far from home,"
3139,114," a small bird flew before me, he was careful"
3140,114," to put a tree between us when he lighted,"
3141,114, and say no word to tell me who he was
3142,114," who was so foolish as to think what he thought,"
3143,114, he thought that i was after him for a feather--
3144,114, the white one in his tail; like one who takes
3145,114," everything said as personal to himself,"
3146,114," one flight out sideways would have undeceived him,"
3147,114, and then there was a pile of wood for which
3148,114, i forgot him and let his little fear
3149,114," carry him off the way i might have gone,"
3150,114," without so much as wishing him good-night,"
3151,114," he went behind it to make his last stand,"
3152,114," it was a cord of maple, cut and split"
3153,114," and piled--and measured, four by four by eight,"
3154,114," and not another like it could i see,"
3155,114," no runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it,"
3156,114," and it was older sure than this year's cutting,"
3157,114," or even last year's or the year's before,"
3158,114, the wood was grey and the bark warping off it
3159,114," and the pile somewhat sunken, clematis"
3160,114," had wound strings round and round it like a bundle,"
3161,114, what held it though on one side was a tree
3162,114," still growing, and on one a stake and prop,"
3163,114," these latter about to fall, i thought that only"
3164,114, someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
3165,114, could so forget his handiwork on which
3166,114," he spent himself, the labour of his axe,"
3167,114, and leave it there far from a useful fireplace
3168,114, to warm the frozen swamp as best it could
3169,114," with the slow smokeless burning of decay,"
3170,115,"grief may have thought it was grief,"
3171,115,"care may have thought it was care,"
3172,115,"they were welcome to their belief,"
3173,115,"the overimportant pair,"
3174,115,
3175,115,"no, it took all the snows that clung"
3176,115,"to the low roof over his bed,"
3177,115,"beginning when he was young,"
3178,115,"to induce the one snow on his head,"
3179,115,
3180,115,but whenever the roof camme white
3181,115,the head in the dark below
3182,115,"was a shade less the color of night,"
3183,115,"a shade more the color of snow,"
3184,115,
3185,115,"grief may have thought it was grief,"
3186,115,"care may have thought it was care,"
3187,115,but neither one was the thief
3188,115,"of his raven color of hair,"
3189,116,i slumbered with your poems on my breast
3190,116,  spread open as i dropped them half-read through
3191,116,  like dove wings on a figure on a tomb
3192,116,"  to see, if in a dream they brought of you,"
3193,116,  i might not have the chance i missed in life
3194,116,"  through some delay, and call you to your face"
3195,116,"  first soldier, and then poet, and then both,"
3196,116,"  who died a soldier-poet of your race,"
3197,116,"  i meant, you meant, that nothing should remain"
3198,116," unsaid between us, brother, and this remained--"
3199,116," and one thing more that was not then to say,"
3200,116," the victory for what it lost and gained,"
3201,116, you went to meet the shell's embrace of fire
3202,116, on vimy ridge; and when you fell that day
3203,116," the war seemed over more for you than me,"
3204,116," but now for me than you--the other way,"
3205,116," how over, though, for even me who knew"
3206,116," the foe thrust back unsafe beyond the rhine,"
3207,116, if i was not to speak of it to you
3208,116, and see you pleased once more with words of mine?
3209,117,love at the lips was touch
3210,117,as sweet as i could bear;
3211,117,and once that seemed too much;
3212,117,i lived on air
3213,117,
3214,117,"that crossed me from sweet things,"
3215,117,the flow of - was it musk
3216,117,from hidden grapevine springs
3217,117,down hill at dusk?
3218,117,
3219,117,i had the swirl and ache
3220,117,from sprays of honeysuckle
3221,117,that when they're gathered shake
3222,117,"dew on the knuckle,"
3223,117,
3224,117,"i craved strong sweets, but those"
3225,117,seemed strong when i was young;
3226,117,the petal of the rose
3227,117,"it was that stung,"
3228,117,
3229,117,now no joy but lacks salt
3230,117,that is not dashed with pain
3231,117,and weariness and fault;
3232,117,i crave the stain
3233,117,
3234,117,"of tears, the aftermark"
3235,117,"of almost too much love,"
3236,117,the sweet of bitter bark
3237,117,"and burning clove,"
3238,117,
3239,117,when stiff and sore and scarred
3240,117,i take away my hand
3241,117,from leaning on it hard
3242,117,"in grass and sand,"
3243,117,
3244,117,"the hurt is not enough,"
3245,117,i long for weight and strength
3246,117,to feel the earth as rough
3247,117,"to all my length,"
3248,118,"come with rain, o loud southwester!"
3249,118,"bring the singer, bring the nester;"
3250,118,give the buried flower a dream;
3251,118,make the settled snowbank steam;
3252,118,find the brown beneath the white;
3253,118,"but whate'er you do tonight,"
3254,118,"bath my window, make it flow,"
3255,118,melt it as the ice will go;
3256,118,melt the glass and leave the sticks
3257,118,like a hermit's crucifix;
3258,118,burst into my narrow stall;
3259,118,swing the picture on the wall;
3260,118,run the rattling pages o'er;
3261,118,scatter poems on the floor;
3262,118,"turn the poet out of door,"
3263,119,"tree at my window, window tree,"
3264,119,my sash is lowered when night comes on;
3265,119,but let there never be curtain drawn
3266,119,"between you and me,"
3267,119,
3268,119,"vague dream head lifted out of the ground,"
3269,119,"and thing next most diffuse to cloud,"
3270,119,not all your light tongues talking aloud
3271,119,"could be profound,"
3272,119,
3273,119,"but tree, i have seen you taken and tossed,"
3274,119,"and if you have seen me when i slept,"
3275,119,you have seen me when i was taken and swept
3276,119,"and all but lost,"
3277,119,
3278,119,"that day she put our heads together,"
3279,119,"fate had her imagination about her,"
3280,119,"your head so much concerned with outer,"
3281,119,"mine with inner, weather,"
3282,120,love and forgetting might have carried them
3283,120,a little further up the mountain side
3284,120,"with night so near, but not much further up,"
3285,120,they must have halted soon in any case
3286,120,"with thoughts of a path back, how rough it was"
3287,120,"with rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness;"
3288,120,when they were halted by a tumbled wall
3289,120,"with barbed-wire binding, they stood facing this,"
3290,120,spending what onward impulse they still had
3291,120,"in one last look the way they must not go,"
3292,120,"on up the failing path, where, if a stone"
3293,120,"or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself;"
3294,120,"no footstep moved it, 'this is all,' they sighed,"
3295,120,"good-night to woods,' but not so; there was more,"
3296,120,a doe from round a spruce stood looking at them
3297,120,"across the wall, as near the wall as they,"
3298,120,"she saw them in their field, they her in hers,"
3299,120,"the difficulty of seeing what stood still,"
3300,120,"like some up-ended boulder split in two,"
3301,120,"was in her clouded eyes; they saw no fear there,"
3302,120,"she seemed to think that two thus they were safe,"
3303,120,"then, as if they were something that, though strange,"
3304,120,"she could not trouble her mind with too long,"
3305,120,"she sighed and passed unscared along the wall,"
3306,120,"'this, then, is all, what more is there to ask?'"
3307,120,"but no, not yet, a snort to bid them wait,"
3308,120,a buck from round the spruce stood looking at them
3309,120,"across the wall as near the wall as they,"
3310,120,"this was an antlered buck of lusty nostril,"
3311,120,"not the same doe come back into her place,"
3312,120,"he viewed them quizzically with jerks of head,"
3313,120,"as if to ask, 'why don't you make some motion?"
3314,120,"or give some sign of life? because you can't,"
3315,120,"i doubt if you're as living as you look,"
3316,120,thus till he had them almost feeling dared
3317,120,"to stretch a proffering hand -- and a spell-breaking,"
3318,120,"then he too passed unscared along the wall,"
3319,120,"two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from,"
3320,120,"'this must be all,' it was all, still they stood,"
3321,120,"a great wave from it going over them,"
3322,120,as if the earth in one unlooked-for favour
3323,120,"had made them certain earth returned their love,"
3324,121,out of the mud two strangers came
3325,121,"and caught me splitting wood in the yard,"
3326,121,and one of them put me off my aim
3327,121,by hailing cheerily hit them hard!
3328,121,i knew pretty well why he had dropped behind
3329,121,"and let the other go on a way,"
3330,121,"i knew pretty well what he had in mind,"
3331,121,"he wanted to take my job for pay,"
3332,121,
3333,121,"good blocks of oak it was i split,"
3334,121,as large around as the chopping block;
3335,121,and every piece i squarely hit
3336,121,"fell splinterless as a cloven rock,"
3337,121,the blows that a life of self-control
3338,121,"spares to strike for the common good,"
3339,121,"that day, giving a loose my soul,"
3340,121,"i spent on the unimportant wood,"
3341,121,
3342,121,"the sun was warm but the wind was chill,"
3343,121,you know how it is with an april day
3344,121,"when the sun is out and the wind is still,"
3345,121,"you're one month on in the middle of may,"
3346,121,"but if you so much as dare to speak,"
3347,121,"a cloud comes over the sunlit arch,"
3348,121,"a wind comes off a frozen peak,"
3349,121,"and you're two months back in the middle of march,"
3350,121,
3351,121,a bluebird comes tenderly up to alight
3352,121,"and turns to the wind to unruffle a plume,"
3353,121,his song so pitched as not to excite
3354,121,"a single flower as yet to bloom,"
3355,121,it is snowing a flake; and he half knew
3356,121,"winter was only playing possum,"
3357,121,"except in color he isn't blue,"
3358,121,"but he wouldn't advise a thing to blossom,"
3359,121,
3360,121,the water for which we may have to look
3361,121,"in summertime with a witching wand,"
3362,121,"in every wheelrut's now a brook,"
3363,121,"in every print of a hoof a pond,"
3364,121,"be glad of water, but don't forget"
3365,121,the lurking frost in the earth beneath
3366,121,that will steal forth after the sun is set
3367,121,"and show on the water its crystal teeth,"
3368,121,
3369,121,the time when most i loved my task
3370,121,the two must make me love it more
3371,121,"by coming with what they came to ask,"
3372,121,you'd think i never had felt before
3373,121,"the weight of an ax-head poised aloft,"
3374,121,"the grip of earth on outspread feet,"
3375,121,the life of muscles rocking soft
3376,121,"and smooth and moist in vernal heat,"
3377,121,
3378,121,out of the wood two hulking tramps
3379,121,"from sleeping god knows where last night,"
3380,121,"but not long since in the lumber camps,"
3381,121,"they thought all chopping was theirs of right,"
3382,121,"men of the woods and lumberjacks,"
3383,121,"they judged me by their appropriate tool,"
3384,121,except as a fellow handled an ax
3385,121,"they had no way of knowing a fool,"
3386,121,
3387,121,"nothing on either side was said,"
3388,121,they knew they had but to stay their stay
3389,121,
3390,121,"and all their logic would fill my head,"
3391,121,as that i had no right to play
3392,121,"with what was another man's work for gain,"
3393,121,"my right might be love but theirs was need,"
3394,121,and where the two exist in twain
3395,121,"theirs was the better right--agreed,"
3396,121,
3397,121,"but yield who will to their separation,"
3398,121,my object in living is to unite
3399,121,my avocation and my vocation
3400,121,"as my two eyes make one in sight,"
3401,121,"only where love and need are one,"
3402,121,"and the work is play for mortal stakes,"
3403,121,is the deed ever really done
3404,121,"for heaven and the future's sakes,"
3405,122,"what things for dream there are when spectre-like,"
3406,122,"   moving among tall haycocks lightly piled,"
3407,122,"   i enter alone upon the stubble field,"
3408,122,"   from which the laborers' voices late have died,"
3409,122,   and in the antiphony of afterglow
3410,122,"   and rising full moon, sit me down"
3411,122,   upon the full moon's side of the first haycock
3412,122,"   and lose myself amid so many alike,"
3413,122,"   i dream upon the opposing lights of the hour,"
3414,122,   preventing shadow until the moon prevail;
3415,122,"   i dream upon the night-hawks peopling heaven,"
3416,122,"   each circling each with vague unearthly cry,"
3417,122,   or plunging headlong with fierce twang afar;
3418,122,"   and on the bat's mute antics, who would seem"
3419,122,"   dimly to have made out my secret place,"
3420,122,"   only to lose it when he pirouettes,"
3421,122,   and seek it endlessly with purblind haste;
3422,122,   on the last swallow's sweep; and on the rasp
3423,122,"   in the abyss of odor and rustle at my back,"
3424,122,"   that, silenced by my advent, finds once more,"
3425,122,"   after an interval, his instrument,"
3426,122,   and tries once--twice--and thrice if i be there;
3427,122,   and on the worn book of old-golden song
3428,122,"   i brought not here to read, it seems, but hold"
3429,122,   and freshen in this air of withering sweetness;
3430,122,"   but on the memory of one absent most,"
3431,122,"   for whom these lines when they shall greet her eye,"
3432,123,"lovers, forget your love,"
3433,123,"   and list to the love of these,"
3434,123,"   she a window flower,"
3435,123,"   and he a winter breeze,"
3436,123,   when the frosty window veil
3437,123,"   was melted down at noon,"
3438,123,   and the cagèd yellow bird
3439,123,"   hung over her in tune,"
3440,123,"   he marked her through the pane,"
3441,123,"   he could not help but mark,"
3442,123,"   and only passed her by,"
3443,123,"   to come again at dark,"
3444,123,"   he was a winter wind,"
3445,123,"   concerned with ice and snow,"
3446,123,"   dead weeds and unmated birds,"
3447,123,"   and little of love could know,"
3448,123,"   but he sighed upon the sill,"
3449,123,"   he gave the sash a shake,"
3450,123,   as witness all within
3451,123,"   who lay that night awake,"
3452,123,   perchance he half prevailed
3453,123,   to win her for the flight
3454,123,   from the firelit looking-glass
3455,123,"   and warm stove-window light,"
3456,123,   but the flower leaned aside
3457,123,"   and thought of naught to say,"
3458,123,   and morning found the breeze
3459,123,"   a hundred miles away,"
