111,3,"he knew what made an airplane fly,"

116,3,"what life was really all about,"
117,3,what was the reason for his birth?
118,3,why was he placed upon this earth?
119,3,"his giant brain went round and round,"

134,3,that is the reason for my life!
135,3,such thoughts as these are not designed
136,3,"to give a pig great piece of mind,"
137,3,"next morning, in comes farmer bland,"
138,3,"a pail of pigswill in his hand,"
139,3,"and piggy with a mighty roar,"
140,3,bashes the farmer to the floor…
141,3,now comes the rather grizzly bit
142,3,"so let's not make too much of it,"
143,3,except that you must understand
144,3,"that piggy did eat farmer bland,"
145,3,"he ate him up from head to toe,"
146,3,"chewing the pieces nice and slow,"
147,3,"it took an hour to reach the feet,"
148,3,"because there was so much to eat,"
149,3,"and when he finished, pig, of course,"
150,3,"felt absolutely no remorse,"
151,3,slowly he scratched his brainy head
152,3,"and with a little smile he said,"
153,3,i had a fairly powerful hunch
154,3,"that he might have me for his lunch,"
155,3,"and so, because i feared the worst,"
156,3,"i thought i'd better eat him first,"
