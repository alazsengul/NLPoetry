166,5,
167,5, upon the sides of latmos was outspread
168,5,a mighty forest; for the moist earth fed
169,5,so plenteously all weed-hidden roots
170,5,"into o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits,"
171,5,"and it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,"
172,5,where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep
173,5,"a lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,"
174,5,never again saw he the happy pens
175,5,"whither his brethren, bleating with content,"
176,5,"over the hills at every nightfall went,"
177,5,"among the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,"
178,5,that not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever
179,5,"from the white flock, but pass'd unworried"
180,5,"by angry wolf, or pard with prying head,"
181,5,until it came to some unfooted plains
182,5,"where fed the herds of pan, ay great his gains"
183,5,"who thus one lamb did lose, paths there were many,"
184,5,"winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,"
185,5,and ivy banks; all leading pleasantly
186,5,"to a wide lawn, whence one could only see"
187,5,stems thronging all around between the swell
188,5,"of turf and slanting branches, who could tell"
189,5,"the freshness of the space of heaven above,"
190,5,edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove
191,5,"would often beat its wings, and often too"
192,5,"a little cloud would move across the blue,"
193,5,
194,5, full in the middle of this pleasantness
195,5,"there stood a marble altar, with a tress"
196,5,of flowers budded newly; and the dew
197,5,had taken fairy phantasies to strew
198,5,"daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,"
199,5,"and so the dawned light in pomp receive,"
200,5,"for 'twas the morn, apollo's upward fire"
201,5,made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre
202,5,"of brightness so unsullied, that therein"
203,5,a melancholy spirit well might win
204,5,"oblivion, and melt out his essence fine"
205,5,"into the winds, rain-scented eglantine"
206,5,gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;
207,5,the lark was lost in him; cold springs had run
208,5,to warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;
209,5,man's voice was on the mountains; and the mass
210,5,"of nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,"
211,5,"to feel this sun-rise and its glories old,"
212,5,
213,5, now while the silent workings of the dawn
214,5,"were busiest, into that self-same lawn"
215,5,"all suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped"
216,5,a troop of little children garlanded;
217,5,"who gathering round the altar, seemed to pry"
218,5,earnestly round as wishing to espy
219,5,"some folk of holiday, nor had they waited"
220,5,"for many moments, ere their ears were sated"
221,5,"with a faint breath of music, which ev'n then"
222,5,"fill'd out its voice, and died away again,"
223,5,within a little space again it gave
224,5,"its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,"
225,5,"to light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking"
226,5,"through copse-clad vallies,--ere their death, oer-taking"
227,5,"the surgy murmurs of the lonely sea,"
228,5,
229,5," and now, as deep into the wood as we"
230,5,"might mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light"
231,5,"fair faces and a rush of garments white,"
232,5,"plainer and plainer shewing, till at last"
233,5,"into the widest alley they all past,"
234,5,"making directly for the woodland altar,"
235,5,o kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter
236,5,"in telling of this goodly company,"
237,5,"of their old piety, and of their glee,"
238,5,but let a portion of ethereal dew
239,5,"fall on my head, and presently unmew"
240,5,"my soul; that i may dare, in wayfaring,"
241,5,"to stammer where old chaucer used to sing,"
242,5,
243,5," leading the way, young damsels danced along,"
244,5,bearing the burden of a shepherd song;
245,5,each having a white wicker over brimm'd
246,5,"with april's tender younglings, next, well trimm'd,"
247,5,a crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks
248,5,as may be read of in arcadian books;
249,5,"such as sat listening round apollo's pipe,"
250,5,"when the great deity, for earth too ripe,"
251,5,let his divinity o'er-flowing die
252,5,"in music, through the vales of thessaly,"
253,5,"some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,"
254,5,and some kept up a shrilly mellow sound
255,5,"with ebon-tipped flutes, close after these,"
256,5,"now coming from beneath the forest trees,"
257,5,"a venerable priest full soberly,"
258,5,"begirt with ministring looks, alway his eye"
259,5,"stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,"
260,5,"and after him his sacred vestments swept,"
261,5,"from his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,"
262,5,"of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;"
263,5,and in his left he held a basket full
264,5,"of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull,"
265,5,"wild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still"
266,5,"than leda's love, and cresses from the rill,"
267,5,"his aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,"
268,5,seem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth
269,5,"of winter hoar, then came another crowd"
270,5,"of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud"
271,5,"their share of the ditty, after them appear'd,"
272,5,up-followed by a multitude that rear'd
273,5,"their voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,"
274,5,easily rolling so as scarce to mar
275,5,"the freedom of three steeds of dapple brown,"
276,5,who stood therein did seem of great renown
277,5,"among the throng, his youth was fully blown,"
278,5,shewing like ganymede to manhood grown;
279,5,"and, for those simple times, his garments were"
280,5,"a chieftain king's, beneath his breast, half bare,"
281,5,"was hung a silver bugle, and between"
282,5,"his nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen,"
283,5,"a smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,"
284,5,"to common lookers on, like one who dream'd"
285,5,"of idleness in groves elysian,"
286,5,but there were some who feelingly could scan
287,5,"a lurking trouble in his nether lip,"
288,5,and see that oftentimes the reins would slip
289,5,"through his forgotten hands, then would they sigh,"
290,5,"and think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,"
291,5,"of logs piled solemnly,--ah, well-a-day,"
292,5,why should our young endymion pine away!
293,5,
294,5," soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,"
295,5,"stood silent round the shrine, each look was chang'd"
296,5,"to sudden veneration, women meek"
297,5,beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek
298,5,"of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear,"
299,5,"endymion too, without a forest peer,"
300,5,"stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,"
301,5,"among his brothers of the mountain chase,"
302,5,"in midst of all, the venerable priest"
303,5,"eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,"
304,5,"and, after lifting up his aged hands,"
305,5,"thus spake he, men of latmos! shepherd bands!"
306,5,"whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks,"
307,5,whether descended from beneath the rocks
308,5,that overtop your mountains; whether come
309,5,from vallies where the pipe is never dumb;
310,5,"or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs"
311,5,"blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze"
312,5,"buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge"
313,5,"nibble their fill at ocean's very marge,"
314,5,whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn
315,5,"by the dim echoes of old triton's horn,"
316,5,mothers and wives! who day by day prepare
317,5,"the scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;"
318,5,and all ye gentle girls who foster up
319,5,"udderless lambs, and in a little cup"
320,5,"will put choice honey for a favoured youth,"
321,5,"yea, every one attend! for in good truth"
322,5,"our vows are wanting to our great god pan,"
323,5,are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
324,5,night-swollen mushrooms? are not our wide plains
325,5,speckled with countless fleeces? have not rains
326,5,green'd over april's lap? no howling sad
327,5,sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had
328,5,"great bounty from endymion our lord,"
329,5,"the earth is glad, the merry lark has pour'd"
330,5,"his early song against yon breezy sky,"
331,5,"that spreads so clear o'er our solemnity,"
332,5,
333,5," thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire"
334,5,"of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;"
335,5,anon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod
336,5,"with wine, in honour of the shepherd-god,"
337,5,"now while the earth was drinking it, and while"
338,5,"bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,"
339,5,and gummy frankincense was sparkling bright
340,5,"'neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light"
341,5,"spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang,"
342,5,
343,5," o thou, whose mighty palace roof doth hang"
344,5,"from jagged trunks, and overshadoweth"
345,5,"eternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death"
346,5,of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;
347,5,who lov'st to see the hamadryads dress
348,5,their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;
349,5,"and through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken"
350,5,the dreary melody of bedded reeds--
351,5,"in desolate places, where dank moisture breeds"
352,5,the pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;
353,5,"bethinking thee, how melancholy loth"
354,5,"thou wast to lose fair syrinx--do thou now,"
355,5,by thy love's milky brow!
356,5,"by all the trembling mazes that she ran,"
357,5,"hear us, great pan!"
358,5,
359,5," o thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles"
360,5,"passion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,"
361,5,what time thou wanderest at eventide
362,5,"through sunny meadows, that outskirt the side"
363,5,"of thine enmossed realms, o thou, to whom"
364,5,broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom
365,5,their ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees
366,5,their golden honeycombs; our village leas
367,5,their fairest-blossom'd beans and poppied corn;
368,5,"the chuckling linnet its five young unborn,"
369,5,to sing for thee; low creeping strawberries
370,5,their summer coolness; pent up butterflies
371,5,"their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year"
372,5,"all its completions--be quickly near,"
373,5,"by every wind that nods the mountain pine,"
374,5,o forester divine!
375,5,
376,5," thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies"
377,5,for willing service; whether to surprise
378,5,the squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;
379,5,or upward ragged precipices flit
380,5,to save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;
381,5,or by mysterious enticement draw
382,5,bewildered shepherds to their path again;
383,5,"or to tread breathless round the frothy main,"
384,5,and gather up all fancifullest shells
385,5,"for thee to tumble into naiads' cells,"
386,5,"and, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;"
387,5,"or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,"
388,5,the while they pelt each other on the crown
389,5,"with silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown--"
390,5,"by all the echoes that about thee ring,"
391,5,"hear us, o satyr king!"
392,5,
393,5," o hearkener to the loud clapping shears,"
394,5,while ever and anon to his shorn peers
395,5,"a ram goes bleating, winder of the horn,"
396,5,when snouted wild-boars routing tender corn
397,5,"anger our huntsman, breather round our farms,"
398,5,"to keep off mildews, and all weather harms,"
399,5,"strange ministrant of undescribed sounds,"
400,5,"that come a swooning over hollow grounds,"
401,5,"and wither drearily on barren moors,"
402,5,dread opener of the mysterious doors
403,5,"leading to universal knowledge--see,"
404,5,"great son of dryope,"
405,5,the many that are come to pay their vows
406,5,with leaves about their brows!
407,5,
408,5, be still the unimaginable lodge
409,5,for solitary thinkings; such as dodge
410,5,"conception to the very bourne of heaven,"
411,5,"then leave the naked brain, be still the leaven,"
412,5,that spreading in this dull and clodded earth
413,5,"gives it a touch ethereal--a new birth,"
414,5,be still a symbol of immensity;
415,5,a firmament reflected in a sea;
416,5,an element filling the space between;
417,5,"an unknown--but no more, we humbly screen"
418,5,"with uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,"
419,5,"and giving out a shout most heaven rending,"
420,5,"conjure thee to receive our humble paean,"
421,5,upon thy mount lycean!
422,5,
423,5," even while they brought the burden to a close,"
424,5,"a shout from the whole multitude arose,"
425,5,that lingered in the air like dying rolls
426,5,"of abrupt thunder, when ionian shoals"
427,5,"of dolphins bob their noses through the brine,"
428,5,"meantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,"
429,5,young companies nimbly began dancing
430,5,"to the swift treble pipe, and humming string,"
431,5,"aye, those fair living forms swam heavenly"
432,5,"to tunes forgotten--out of memory,"
433,5,fair creatures! whose young children's children bred
434,5,"thermopylæ its heroes--not yet dead,"
435,5,"but in old marbles ever beautiful,"
436,5,"high genitors, unconscious did they cull"
437,5,"time's sweet first-fruits--they danc'd to weariness,"
438,5,and then in quiet circles did they press
439,5,"the hillock turf, and caught the latter end"
440,5,"of some strange history, potent to send"
441,5,"a young mind from its bodily tenement,"
442,5,"or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent"
443,5,on either side; pitying the sad death
444,5,"of hyacinthus, when the cruel breath"
445,5,"of zephyr slew him,--zephyr penitent,"
446,5,"who now, ere phoebus mounts the firmament,"
447,5,"fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain,"
448,5,"the archers too, upon a wider plain,"
449,5,"beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,"
450,5,"and the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft"
451,5,"branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,"
452,5,call'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope
453,5,"those who would watch, perhaps, the trembling knee"
454,5,"and frantic gape of lonely niobe,"
455,5,"poor, lonely niobe! when her lovely young"
456,5,"were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue"
457,5,"lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,"
458,5,"and very, very deadliness did nip"
459,5,"her motherly cheeks, arous'd from this sad mood"
460,5,"by one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,"
461,5,"uplifting his strong bow into the air,"
462,5,"many might after brighter visions stare,"
463,5,"after the argonauts, in blind amaze"
464,5,"tossing about on neptune's restless ways,"
465,5,"until, from the horizon's vaulted side,"
466,5,"there shot a golden splendour far and wide,"
467,5,spangling those million poutings of the brine
468,5,"with quivering ore, 'twas even an awful shine"
469,5,from the exaltation of apollo's bow;
470,5,"a heavenly beacon in their dreary woe,"
471,5,"who thus were ripe for high contemplating,"
472,5,might turn their steps towards the sober ring
473,5,where sat endymion and the aged priest
474,5,"'mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd"
475,5,"the silvery setting of their mortal star,"
476,5,there they discours'd upon the fragile bar
477,5,that keeps us from our homes ethereal;
478,5,"and what our duties there, to nightly call"
479,5,"vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;"
480,5,to summon all the downiest clouds together
481,5,for the sun's purple couch; to emulate
482,5,in ministring the potent rule of fate
483,5,with speed of fire-tailed exhalations;
484,5,"to tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons"
485,5,"sweet poesy by moonlight, besides these,"
486,5,"a world of other unguess'd offices,"
487,5,"anon they wander'd, by divine converse,"
488,5,into elysium; vieing to rehearse
489,5,"each one his own anticipated bliss,"
490,5,one felt heart-certain that he could not miss
491,5,"his quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,"
492,5,where every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows
493,5,"her lips with music for the welcoming,"
494,5,"another wish'd, mid that eternal spring,"
495,5,"to meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,"
496,5,"sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales,"
497,5,"who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,"
498,5,and with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;
499,5,"and, ever after, through those regions be"
500,5,"his messenger, his little mercury,"
501,5,some were athirst in soul to see again
502,5,their fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign
503,5,"in times long past; to sit with them, and talk"
504,5,of all the chances in their earthly walk;
505,5,"comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores"
506,5,"of happiness, to when upon the moors,"
507,5,"benighted, close they huddled from the cold,"
508,5,"and shar'd their famish'd scrips, thus all out-told"
509,5,"their fond imaginations,--saving him"
510,5,"whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,"
511,5,"endymion, yet hourly had he striven"
512,5,"to hide the cankering venom, that had riven"
513,5,"his fainting recollections, now indeed"
514,5,"his senses had swoon'd off, he did not heed"
515,5,"the sudden silence, or the whispers low,"
516,5,"or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,"
517,5,"or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,"
518,5,"or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms,"
519,5,"but in the self-same fixed trance he kept,"
520,5,"like one who on the earth had never stept,"
521,5,"aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,"
522,5,"frozen in that old tale arabian,"
523,5,
524,5, who whispers him so pantingly and close?
525,5,"peona, his sweet sister, of all those,"
526,5,"his friends, the dearest, hushing signs she made,"
527,5,and breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade
528,5,"a yielding up, a cradling on her care,"
529,5,"her eloquence did breathe away the curse,"
530,5,"she led him, like some midnight spirit nurse"
531,5,"of happy changes in emphatic dreams,"
532,5,"along a path between two little streams,--"
533,5,"guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,"
534,5,"from low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow"
535,5,from stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;
536,5,"until they came to where these streamlets fall,"
537,5,"with mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,"
538,5,"into a river, clear, brimful, and flush"
539,5,"with crystal mocking of the trees and sky,"
540,5,"a little shallop, floating there hard by,"
541,5,pointed its beak over the fringed bank;
542,5,"and soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,"
543,5,"and dipt again, with the young couple's weight,--"
544,5,"peona guiding, through the water straight,"
545,5,towards a bowery island opposite;
546,5,"which gaining presently, she steered light"
547,5,"into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,"
548,5,"where nested was an arbour, overwove"
549,5,by many a summer's silent fingering;
550,5,to whose cool bosom she was used to bring
551,5,"her playmates, with their needle broidery,"
552,5,"and minstrel memories of times gone by,"
553,5,
554,5, so she was gently glad to see him laid
555,5,"under her favourite bower's quiet shade,"
556,5,"on her own couch, new made of flower leaves,"
557,5,dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves
558,5,"when last the sun his autumn tresses shook,"
559,5,"and the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took,"
560,5,"soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest,"
561,5,"but, ere it crept upon him, he had prest"
562,5,"peona's busy hand against his lips,"
563,5,"and still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips"
564,5,"in tender pressure, and as a willow keeps"
565,5,a patient watch over the stream that creeps
566,5,"windingly by it, so the quiet maid"
567,5,"held her in peace, so that a whispering blade"
568,5,"of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling"
569,5,"down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling"
570,5,"among seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard,"
571,5,
572,5," o magic sleep! o comfortable bird,"
573,5,that broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind
574,5,till it is hush'd and smooth! o unconfin'd
575,5,restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key
576,5,"to golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,"
577,5,"fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,"
578,5,"echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves"
579,5,"and moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world"
580,5,"of silvery enchantment!--who, upfurl'd"
581,5,"beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,"
582,5,"but renovates and lives?--thus, in the bower,"
583,5,"endymion was calm'd to life again,"
584,5,"opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,"
585,5,"he said, i feel this thine endearing love"
586,5,"all through my bosom, thou art as a dove"
587,5,trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings
588,5,about me; and the pearliest dew not brings
589,5,"such morning incense from the fields of may,"
590,5,as do those brighter drops that twinkling stray
591,5,"from those kind eyes,--the very home and haunt"
592,5,"of sisterly affection, can i want"
593,5,"aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?"
594,5,"yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears"
595,5,"that, any longer, i will pass my days"
596,5,"alone and sad, no, i will once more raise"
597,5,my voice upon the mountain-heights; once more
598,5,"make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar,"
599,5,again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll
600,5,"around the breathed boar, again i'll poll"
601,5,"the fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow,"
602,5,"and, when the pleasant sun is getting low,"
603,5,again i'll linger in a sloping mead
604,5,"to hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed"
605,5,"our idle sheep, so be thou cheered sweet,"
606,5,"and, if thy lute is here, softly intreat"
607,5,"my soul to keep in its resolved course,"
608,5,
609,5," hereat peona, in their silver source,"
610,5,"shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,"
611,5,"and took a lute, from which there pulsing came"
612,5,"a lively prelude, fashioning the way"
613,5,"in which her voice should wander, 'twas a lay"
614,5,"more subtle cadenced, more forest wild"
615,5,than dryope's lone lulling of her child;
616,5,and nothing since has floated in the air
617,5,"so mournful strange, surely some influence rare"
618,5,"went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;"
619,5,"for still, with delphic emphasis, she spann'd"
620,5,"the quick invisible strings, even though she saw"
621,5,endymion's spirit melt away and thaw
622,5,"before the deep intoxication,"
623,5,"but soon she came, with sudden burst, upon"
624,5,"her self-possession--swung the lute aside,"
625,5,"and earnestly said, brother, 'tis vain to hide"
626,5,"that thou dost know of things mysterious,"
627,5,"immortal, starry; such alone could thus"
628,5,"weigh down thy nature, hast thou sinn'd in aught"
629,5,offensive to the heavenly powers? caught
630,5,a paphian dove upon a message sent?
631,5,"thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,"
632,5,"sacred to dian? haply, thou hast seen"
633,5,her naked limbs among the alders green;
634,5,"and that, alas! is death, no, i can trace"
635,5,something more high perplexing in thy face!
636,5,
637,5," endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,"
638,5,"and said, art thou so pale, who wast so bland"
639,5,and merry in our meadows? how is this?
640,5,"tell me thine ailment, tell me all amiss!--"
641,5,ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change
642,5,"wrought suddenly in me, what indeed more strange?"
643,5,or more complete to overwhelm surmise?
644,5,"ambition is no sluggard, 'tis no prize,"
645,5,"that toiling years would put within my grasp,"
646,5,"that i have sigh'd for, with so deadly gasp"
647,5,"no man e'er panted for a mortal love,"
648,5,so all have set my heavier grief above
649,5,"these things which happen, rightly have they done,"
650,5,"i, who still saw the horizontal sun"
651,5,"heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,"
652,5,"out-facing lucifer, and then had hurl'd"
653,5,"my spear aloft, as signal for the chace--"
654,5,"i, who, for very sport of heart, would race"
655,5,with my own steed from araby; pluck down
656,5,a vulture from his towery perching; frown
657,5,"a lion into growling, loth retire--"
658,5,"to lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,"
659,5,and sink thus low! but i will ease my breast
660,5,"of secret grief, here in this bowery nest,"
661,5,
662,5," this river does not see the naked sky,"
663,5,till it begins to progress silverly
664,5,"around the western border of the wood,"
665,5,"whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood"
666,5,"seems at the distance like a crescent moon,"
667,5,"and in that nook, the very pride of june,"
668,5,had i been used to pass my weary eves;
669,5,the rather for the sun unwilling leaves
670,5,"so dear a picture of his sovereign power,"
671,5,"and i could witness his most kingly hour,"
672,5,"when he doth lighten up the golden reins,"
673,5,and paces leisurely down amber plains
674,5,"his snorting four, now when his chariot last"
675,5,"its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,"
676,5,there blossom'd suddenly a magic bed
677,5,"of sacred ditamy, and poppies red,"
678,5,"at which i wondered greatly, knowing well"
679,5,that but one night had wrought this flowery spell;
680,5,"and, sitting down close by, began to muse"
681,5,"what it might mean, perhaps, thought i, morpheus,"
682,5,"in passing here, his owlet pinions shook;"
683,5,"or, it may be, ere matron night uptook"
684,5,"her ebon urn, young mercury, by stealth,"
685,5,"had dipt his rod in it, such garland wealth"
686,5,"came not by common growth, thus on i thought,"
687,5,"until my head was dizzy and distraught,"
688,5,"moreover, through the dancing poppies stole"
689,5,"a breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;"
690,5,and shaping visions all about my sight
691,5,"of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;"
692,5,"the which became more strange, and strange, and dim,"
693,5,"and then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim,"
694,5,"and then i fell asleep, ah, can i tell"
695,5,the enchantment that afterwards befel?
696,5,"yet it was but a dream, yet such a dream"
697,5,"that never tongue, although it overteem"
698,5,"with mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,"
699,5,could figure out and to conception bring
700,5,"all i beheld and felt, methought i lay"
701,5,"watching the zenith, where the milky way"
702,5,among the stars in virgin splendour pours;
703,5,"and travelling my eye, until the doors"
704,5,"of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,"
705,5,i became loth and fearful to alight
706,5,"from such high soaring by a downward glance,"
707,5,"so kept me stedfast in that airy trance,"
708,5,"spreading imaginary pinions wide,"
709,5,"when, presently, the stars began to glide,"
710,5,"and faint away, before my eager view,"
711,5,"at which i sigh'd that i could not pursue,"
712,5,and dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;
713,5,"and lo! from opening clouds, i saw emerge"
714,5,"the loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er"
715,5,"a shell for neptune's goblet, she did soar"
716,5,"so passionately bright, my dazzled soul"
717,5,commingling with her argent spheres did roll
718,5,"through clear and cloudy, even when she went"
719,5,at last into a dark and vapoury tent--
720,5,"whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train"
721,5,"of planets all were in the blue again,"
722,5,"to commune with those orbs, once more i rais'd"
723,5,"my sight right upward, but it was quite dazed"
724,5,"by a bright something, sailing down apace,"
725,5,"making me quickly veil my eyes and face,"
726,5,"again i look'd, and, o ye deities,"
727,5,who from olympus watch our destinies!
728,5,whence that completed form of all completeness?
729,5,whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?
730,5,"speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, o where"
731,5,hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?
732,5,not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;
733,5,"not--thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun"
734,5,"such follying before thee--yet she had,"
735,5,"indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;"
736,5,"and they were simply gordian'd up and braided,"
737,5,"leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,"
738,5,"her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;"
739,5,"the which were blended in, i know not how,"
740,5,"with such a paradise of lips and eyes,"
741,5,"blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,"
742,5,"that, when i think thereon, my spirit clings"
743,5,"and plays about its fancy, till the stings"
744,5,"of human neighbourhood envenom all,"
745,5,unto what awful power shall i call?
746,5,"to what high fane?--ah! see her hovering feet,"
747,5,"more bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet"
748,5,"than those of sea-born venus, when she rose"
749,5,"from out her cradle shell, the wind out-blows"
750,5,her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;
751,5,"'tis blue, and over-spangled with a million"
752,5,"of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,"
753,5,"over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,"
754,5,"handfuls of daisies,--endymion, how strange!"
755,5,"dream within dream!--she took an airy range,"
756,5,"and then, towards me, like a very maid,"
757,5,"came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,"
758,5,"and press'd me by the hand, ah! 'twas too much;"
759,5,"methought i fainted at the charmed touch,"
760,5,"yet held my recollection, even as one"
761,5,who dives three fathoms where the waters run
762,5,"gurgling in beds of coral, for anon,"
763,5,i felt upmounted in that region
764,5,"where falling stars dart their artillery forth,"
765,5,and eagles struggle with the buffeting north
766,5,that balances the heavy meteor-stone;--
767,5,"felt too, i was not fearful, nor alone,"
768,5,"but lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky,"
769,5,"soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,"
770,5,and straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;
771,5,such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd
772,5,"huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side,"
773,5,"there hollow sounds arous'd me, and i sigh'd"
774,5,to faint once more by looking on my bliss--
775,5,i was distracted; madly did i kiss
776,5,"the wooing arms which held me, and did give"
777,5,"my eyes at once to death, but 'twas to live,"
778,5,to take in draughts of life from the gold fount
779,5,"of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count"
780,5,"the moments, by some greedy help that seem'd"
781,5,"a second self, that each might be redeem'd"
782,5,"and plunder'd of its load of blessedness,"
783,5,"ah, desperate mortal! i ev'n dar'd to press"
784,5,"her very cheek against my crowned lip,"
785,5,"and, at that moment, felt my body dip"
786,5,"into a warmer air, a moment more,"
787,5,"our feet were soft in flowers, there was store"
788,5,"of newest joys upon that alp, sometimes"
789,5,"a scent of violets, and blossoming limes,"
790,5,"loiter'd around us; then of honey cells,"
791,5,made delicate from all white-flower bells;
792,5,"and once, above the edges of our nest,"
793,5,"an arch face peep'd,--an oread as i guess'd,"
794,5,
795,5, why did i dream that sleep o'er-power'd me
796,5,"in midst of all this heaven? why not see,"
797,5,"far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,"
798,5,"and stare them from me? but no, like a spark"
799,5,"that needs must die, although its little beam"
800,5,"reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream"
801,5,"fell into nothing--into stupid sleep,"
802,5,"and so it was, until a gentle creep,"
803,5,"a careful moving caught my waking ears,"
804,5,"and up i started, ah! my sighs, my tears,"
805,5,my clenched hands;--for lo! the poppies hung
806,5,"dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung"
807,5,"a heavy ditty, and the sullen day"
808,5,"had chidden herald hesperus away,"
809,5,"with leaden looks, the solitary breeze"
810,5,"bluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze"
811,5,"with wayward melancholy; and r thought,"
812,5,"mark me, peona! that sometimes it brought"
813,5,"faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!--"
814,5,away i wander'd--all the pleasant hues
815,5,"of heaven and earth had faded, deepest shades"
816,5,were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades
817,5,were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills
818,5,"seem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills"
819,5,of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown
820,5,"in frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown"
821,5,"like spiked aloe, if an innocent bird"
822,5,"before my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd"
823,5,"in little journeys, i beheld in it"
824,5,"a disguis'd demon, missioned to knit"
825,5,my soul with under darkness; to entice
826,5,"my stumblings down some monstrous precipice,"
827,5,"therefore i eager followed, and did curse"
828,5,"the disappointment, time, that aged nurse,"
829,5,"rock'd me to patience, now, thank gentle heaven!"
830,5,"these things, with all their comfortings, are given"
831,5,"to my down-sunken hours, and with thee,"
832,5,"sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea"
833,5,"of weary life,"
834,5,
835,5,"                 thus ended he, and both"
836,5,"sat silent, for the maid was very loth"
837,5,to answer; feeling well that breathed words
838,5,"would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords"
839,5,"against the enchased crocodile, or leaps"
840,5,"of grasshoppers against the sun, she weeps,"
841,5,and wonders; struggles to devise some blame;
842,5,"to put on such a look as would say, shame"
843,5,"on this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,"
844,5,she could as soon have crush'd away the life
845,5,"from a sick dove, at length, to break the pause,"
846,5,"she said with trembling chance, is this the cause?"
847,5,"this all? yet it is strange, and sad, alas!"
848,5,that one who through this middle earth should pass
849,5,"most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave"
850,5,"his name upon the harp-string, should achieve"
851,5,"no higher bard than simple maidenhood,"
852,5,"singing alone, and fearfully,--how the blood"
853,5,left his young cheek; and how he used to stray
854,5,"he knew not where; and how he would say, nay,"
855,5,"if any said 'twas love, and yet 'twas love;"
856,5,what could it be but love? how a ring-dove
857,5,let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;
858,5,"and how he died, and then, that love doth scathe,"
859,5,"the gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;"
860,5,and then the ballad of his sad life closes
861,5,"with sighs, and an alas!--endymion!"
862,5,"be rather in the trumpet's mouth,--anon"
863,5,among the winds at large--that all may hearken!
864,5,"although, before the crystal heavens darken,"
865,5,i watch and dote upon the silver lakes
866,5,"pictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes"
867,5,"the semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,"
868,5,"islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands"
869,5,"with horses prancing o'er them, palaces"
870,5,"and towers of amethyst,--would i so tease"
871,5,"my pleasant days, because i could not mount"
872,5,into those regions? the morphean fount
873,5,"of that fine element that visions, dreams,"
874,5,"and fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams"
875,5,"into its airy channels with so subtle,"
876,5,"so thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,"
877,5,circled a million times within the space
878,5,"of a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,"
879,5,"a tinting of its quality, how light"
880,5,must dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight
881,5,than the mere nothing that engenders them!
882,5,then wherefore sully the entrusted gem
883,5,of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?
884,5,why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick
885,5,for nothing but a dream? hereat the youth
886,5,"look'd up, a conflicting of shame and ruth"
887,5,"was in his plaited brow, yet his eyelids"
888,5,"widened a little, as when zephyr bids"
889,5,a little breeze to creep between the fans
890,5,"of careless butterflies, amid his pains"
891,5,"he seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,"
892,5,full palatable; and a colour grew
893,5,"upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake,"
894,5,
895,5, peona! ever have i long'd to slake
896,5,"my thirst for the world's praises, nothing base,"
897,5,"no merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace"
898,5,the stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd--
899,5,though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd
900,5,"and sullenly drifting, yet my higher hope"
901,5,"is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,"
902,5,"to fret at myriads of earthly wrecks,"
903,5,wherein lies happiness? in that which becks
904,5,"our ready minds to fellowship divine,"
905,5,"a fellowship with essence; till we shine,"
906,5,"full alchemiz'd, and free of space, behold"
907,5,the clear religion of heaven! fold
908,5,"a rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,"
909,5,"and soothe thy lips, hist, when the airy stress"
910,5,"of music's kiss impregnates the free winds,"
911,5,and with a sympathetic touch unbinds
912,5,"eolian magic from their lucid wombs,"
913,5,then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;
914,5,old ditties sigh above their father's grave;
915,5,ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave
916,5,round every spot where trod apollo's foot;
917,5,"bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,"
918,5,where long ago a giant battle was;
919,5,"and, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass"
920,5,"in every place where infant orpheus slept,"
921,5,feel we these things?--that moment have we stept
922,5,"into a sort of oneness, and our state"
923,5,"is like a floating spirit's, but there are"
924,5,"richer entanglements, enthralments far"
925,5,"more self-destroying, leading, by degrees,"
926,5,"to the chief intensity, the crown of these"
927,5,"is made of love and friendship, and sits high"
928,5,"upon the forehead of humanity,"
929,5,all its more ponderous and bulky worth
930,5,"is friendship, whence there ever issues forth"
931,5,"a steady splendour; but at the tip-top,"
932,5,"there hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop"
933,5,"of light, and that is love, its influence,"
934,5,"thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,"
935,5,"at which we start and fret; till in the end,"
936,5,"melting into its radiance, we blend,"
937,5,"mingle, and so become a part of it,--"
938,5,nor with aught else can our souls interknit
939,5,"so wingedly, when we combine therewith,"
940,5,"life's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,"
941,5,"and we are nurtured like a pelican brood,"
942,5,"aye, so delicious is the unsating food,"
943,5,"that men, who might have tower'd in the van"
944,5,"of all the congregated world, to fan"
945,5,and winnow from the coming step of time
946,5,"all chaff of custom, wipe away all slime"
947,5,"left by men-slugs and human serpentry,"
948,5,"have been content to let occasion die,"
949,5,"whilst they did sleep in love's elysium,"
950,5,"and, truly, i would rather be struck dumb,"
951,5,"than speak against this ardent listlessness,"
952,5,for i have ever thought that it might bless
953,5,the world with benefits unknowingly;
954,5,"as does the nightingale, upperched high,"
955,5,and cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves--
956,5,"she sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives"
957,5,"how tiptoe night holds back her dark-grey hood,"
958,5,"just so may love, although 'tis understood"
959,5,"the mere commingling of passionate breath,"
960,5,"produce more than our searching witnesseth,"
961,5,"what i know not, but who, of men, can tell"
962,5,"that flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell"
963,5,"to melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,"
964,5,"the earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,"
965,5,"the meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,"
966,5,"the seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,"
967,5,"tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,"
968,5,if human souls did never kiss and greet?
969,5,
970,5," now, if this earthly love has power to make"
971,5,"men's being mortal, immortal; to shake"
972,5,"ambition from their memories, and brim"
973,5,"their measure of content; what merest whim,"
974,5,"seems all this poor endeavour after fame,"
975,5,"to one, who keeps within his stedfast aim"
976,5,"a love immortal, an immortal too,"
977,5,"look not so wilder'd; for these things are true,"
978,5,and never can be born of atomies
979,5,"that buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,"
980,5,"leaving us fancy-sick, no, no, i'm sure,"
981,5,my restless spirit never could endure
982,5,"to brood so long upon one luxury,"
983,5,"unless it did, though fearfully, espy"
984,5,"a hope beyond the shadow of a dream,"
985,5,"my sayings will the less obscured seem,"
986,5,when i have told thee how my waking sight
987,5,has made me scruple whether that same night
988,5,"was pass'd in dreaming, hearken, sweet peona!"
989,5,"beyond the matron-temple of latona,"
990,5,"which we should see but for these darkening boughs,"
991,5,"lies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows"
992,5,"bushes and trees do lean all round athwart,"
993,5,"and meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,"
994,5,"and spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide"
995,5,"past them, but he must brush on every side,"
996,5,"some moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,"
997,5,"far as the slabbed margin of a well,"
998,5,whose patient level peeps its crystal eye
999,5,"right upward, through the bushes, to the sky,"
1000,5,"oft have i brought thee flowers, on their stalks set"
1001,5,"like vestal primroses, but dark velvet"
1002,5,"edges them round, and they have golden pits,"
1003,5,"'twas there i got them, from the gaps and slits"
1004,5,"in a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,"
1005,5,"when all above was faint with mid-day heat,"
1006,5,"and there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,"
1007,5,i'd bubble up the water through a reed;
1008,5,"so reaching back to boy-hood, make me ships"
1009,5,"of moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,"
1010,5,with leaves stuck in them; and the neptune be
1011,5,"of their petty ocean, oftener, heavily,"
1012,5,"when love-lorn hours had left me less a child,"
1013,5,i sat contemplating the figures wild
1014,5,"of o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through,"
1015,5,"upon a day, while thus i watch'd, by flew"
1016,5,"a cloudy cupid, with his bow and quiver;"
1017,5,"so plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver"
1018,5,"the happy chance, so happy, i was fain"
1019,5,"to follow it upon the open plain,"
1020,5,"and, therefore, was just going; when, behold!"
1021,5,"a wonder, fair as any i have told--"
1022,5,"the same bright face i tasted in my sleep,"
1023,5,"smiling in the clear well, my heart did leap"
1024,5,"through the cool depth,--it moved as if to flee--"
1025,5,"i started up, when lo! refreshfully,"
1026,5,"there came upon my face, in plenteous showers,"
1027,5,"dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,"
1028,5,"wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,"
1029,5,"bathing my spirit in a new delight,"
1030,5,"aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss"
1031,5,alone preserved me from the drear abyss
1032,5,"of death, for the fair form had gone again,"
1033,5,pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain
1034,5,"clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth"
1035,5,"on the deer's tender haunches, late, and loth,"
1036,5,"'tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure,"
1037,5,"how sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure"
1038,5,"of weary days, made deeper exquisite,"
1039,5,by a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!
1040,5,"like sorrow came upon me, heavier still,"
1041,5,"than when i wander'd from the poppy hill,"
1042,5,and a whole age of lingering moments crept
1043,5,"sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept"
1044,5,"away at once the deadly yellow spleen,"
1045,5,"yes, thrice have i this fair enchantment seen;"
1046,5,"once more been tortured with renewed life,"
1047,5,when last the wintry gusts gave over strife
1048,5,"with the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies"
1049,5,"warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes"
1050,5,"in pity of the shatter'd infant buds,--"
1051,5,"that time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,"
1052,5,"my hunting cap, because i laugh'd and smil'd,"
1053,5,"chatted with thee, and many days exil'd"
1054,5,"all torment from my breast;--'twas even then,"
1055,5,"straying about, yet, coop'd up in the den"
1056,5,"of helpless discontent,--hurling my lance"
1057,5,"from place to place, and following at chance,"
1058,5,"at last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,"
1059,5,"and, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck"
1060,5,"in the middle of a brook,--whose silver ramble"
1061,5,"down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,"
1062,5,"tracing along, it brought me to a cave,"
1063,5,"whence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave"
1064,5,"the nether sides of mossy stones and rock,--"
1065,5,"'mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock"
1066,5,"its own sweet grief at parting, overhead,"
1067,5,"hung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread"
1068,5,"thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home,"
1069,5,"ah! impious mortal, whither do i roam?"
1070,5,"said i, low voic'd, ah whither! 'tis the grot"
1071,5,"of proserpine, when hell, obscure and hot,"
1072,5,doth her resign; and where her tender hands
1073,5,"she dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands,"
1074,5,"or 'tis the cell of echo, where she sits,"
1075,5,"and babbles thorough silence, till her wits"
1076,5,"are gone in tender madness, and anon,"
1077,5,"faints into sleep, with many a dying tone"
1078,5,"of sadness, o that she would take my vows,"
1079,5,"and breathe them sighingly among the boughs,"
1080,5,"to sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,"
1081,5,"daily, i pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,"
1082,5,and weave them dyingly--send honey-whispers
1083,5,"round every leaf, that all those gentle lispers"
1084,5,may sigh my love unto her pitying!
1085,5,"o charitable echo! hear, and sing"
1086,5,this ditty to her!--tell her--so i stay'd
1087,5,"my foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,"
1088,5,"stood stupefied with my own empty folly,"
1089,5,"and blushing for the freaks of melancholy,"
1090,5,"salt tears were coming, when i heard my name"
1091,5,"most fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came,"
1092,5,‘endymion! the cave is secreter
1093,5,"than the isle of delos, echo hence shall stir"
1094,5,"no sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise"
1095,5,"of thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys"
1096,5,"and trembles through my labyrinthine hair,"
1097,5,"at that oppress'd i hurried in,--ah! where"
1098,5,are those swift moments? whither are they fled?
1099,5,"i'll smile no more, peona; nor will wed"
1100,5,"sorrow the way to death, but patiently"
1101,5,"bear up against it, so farewel, sad sigh;"
1102,5,"and come instead demurest meditation,"
1103,5,"to occupy me wholly, and to fashion"
1104,5,"my pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink,"
1105,5,"no more will i count over, link by link,"
1106,5,"my chain of grief, no longer strive to find"
1107,5,a half-forgetfulness in mountain wind
1108,5,"blustering about my ears, aye, thou shalt see,"
1109,5,"dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;"
1110,5,"what a calm round of hours shall make my days,"
1111,5,there is a paly flame of hope that plays
1112,5,"where'er i look, but yet, i'll say 'tis naught--"
1113,5,"and here i bid it die, have not i caught,"
1114,5,"already, a more healthy countenance?"
1115,5,by this the sun is setting; we may chance
1116,5,"meet some of our near-dwellers with my car,"
1117,5,
1118,5," this said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star"
1119,5,"through autumn mists, and took peona's hand,"
1120,5,"they stept into the boat, and launch'd from land,"
1121,6,o sovereign power of love! o grief! o balm!
1122,6,"all records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,"
1123,6,"and shadowy, through the mist of passed years,"
1124,6,"for others, good or bad, hatred and tears"
1125,6,"have become indolent; but touching thine,"
1126,6,"one sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,"
1127,6,"one kiss brings honey-dew from buried days,"
1128,6,"the woes of troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,"
1129,6,"stiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,"
1130,6,"struggling, and blood, and shrieks--all dimly fades"
1131,6,into some backward corner of the brain;
1132,6,"yet, in our very souls, we feel amain"
1133,6,"the close of troilus and cressid sweet,"
1134,6,"hence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!"
1135,6,swart planet in the universe of deeds!
1136,6,"wide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds"
1137,6,along the pebbled shore of memory!
1138,6,many old rotten-timber'd boats there be
1139,6,"upon thy vaporous bosom, magnified"
1140,6,"to goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,"
1141,6,"and golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry,"
1142,6,"but wherefore this? what care, though owl did fly"
1143,6,about the great athenian admiral's mast?
1144,6,"what care, though striding alexander past"
1145,6,the indus with his macedonian numbers?
1146,6,though old ulysses tortured from his slumbers
1147,6,"the glutted cyclops, what care?--juliet leaning"
1148,6,"amid her window-flowers,--sighing,--weaning"
1149,6,"tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,"
1150,6,"doth more avail than these, the silver flow"
1151,6,"of hero's tears, the swoon of imogen,"
1152,6,"fair pastorella in the bandit's den,"
1153,6,are things to brood on with more ardency
1154,6,"than the death-day of empires, fearfully"
1155,6,"must such conviction come upon his head,"
1156,6,"who, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,"
1157,6,"without one muse's smile, or kind behest,"
1158,6,"the path of love and poesy, but rest,"
1159,6,"in chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear"
1160,6,"than to be crush'd, in striving to uprear"
1161,6,"love's standard on the battlements of song,"
1162,6,"so once more days and nights aid me along,"
1163,6,"like legion'd soldiers,"
1164,6,
1165,6,"                       brain-sick shepherd-prince,"
1166,6,what promise hast thou faithful guarded since
1167,6,"the day of sacrifice? or, have new sorrows"
1168,6,come with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?
1169,6,"alas! 'tis his old grief, for many days,"
1170,6,"has he been wandering in uncertain ways,"
1171,6,"through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;"
1172,6,"counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes"
1173,6,"of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,"
1174,6,"hour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill,"
1175,6,"now he is sitting by a shady spring,"
1176,6,and elbow-deep with feverous fingering
1177,6,"stems the upbursting cold, a wild rose tree"
1178,6,"pavilions him in bloom, and he doth see"
1179,6,"a bud which snares his fancy, lo! but now"
1180,6,"he plucks it, dips its stalk in the water, how!"
1181,6,"it swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;"
1182,6,"and, in the middle, there is softly pight"
1183,6,a golden butterfly; upon whose wings
1184,6,"there must be surely character'd strange things,"
1185,6,"for with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft,"
1186,6,
1187,6," lightly this little herald flew aloft,"
1188,6,"follow'd by glad endymion's clasped hands,"
1189,6,"onward it flies, from languor's sullen bands"
1190,6,"his limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies"
1191,6,"dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies,"
1192,6,"it seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;"
1193,6,and like a new-born spirit did he pass
1194,6,"through the green evening quiet in the sun,"
1195,6,"o'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,"
1196,6,"through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams"
1197,6,"the summer time away, one track unseams"
1198,6,"a wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue"
1199,6,"of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,"
1200,6,"he sinks adown a solitary glen,"
1201,6,"where there was never sound of mortal men,"
1202,6,"saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences"
1203,6,"melting to silence, when upon the breeze"
1204,6,"some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,"
1205,6,"to cheer itself to delphi, still his feet"
1206,6,"went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,"
1207,6,until it reached a splashing fountain's side
1208,6,"that, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd"
1209,6,"unto the temperate air, then high it soar'd,"
1210,6,"and, downward, suddenly began to dip,"
1211,6,"as if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip"
1212,6,"the crystal spout-head, so it did, with touch"
1213,6,"most delicate, as though afraid to smutch"
1214,6,"even with mealy gold the waters clear,"
1215,6,"but, at that very touch, to disappear"
1216,6,"so fairy-quick, was strange! bewildered,"
1217,6,"endymion sought around, and shook each bed"
1218,6,of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung
1219,6,"himself along the grass, what gentle tongue,"
1220,6,what whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?
1221,6,it was a nymph uprisen to the breast
1222,6,"in the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood"
1223,6,"'mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood,"
1224,6,"to him her dripping hand she softly kist,"
1225,6,and anxiously began to plait and twist
1226,6,"her ringlets round her fingers, saying, youth!"
1227,6,"too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,"
1228,6,"the bitterness of love, too long indeed,"
1229,6,"seeing thou art so gentle, could i weed"
1230,6,"thy soul of care, by heavens, i would offer"
1231,6,all the bright riches of my crystal coffer
1232,6,"to amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,"
1233,6,"golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,"
1234,6,"vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;"
1235,6,"yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws"
1236,6,a virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands
1237,6,"tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands"
1238,6,"by my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,"
1239,6,"my charming rod, my potent river spells;"
1240,6,"yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup"
1241,6,"meander gave me,--for i bubbled up"
1242,6,"to fainting creatures in a desert wild,"
1243,6,"but woe is me, i am but as a child"
1244,6,"to gladden thee; and all i dare to say,"
1245,6,"is, that i pity thee; that on this day"
1246,6,i've been thy guide; that thou must wander far
1247,6,"in other regions, past the scanty bar"
1248,6,"to mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en"
1249,6,"from every wasting sigh, from every pain,"
1250,6,"into the gentle bosom of thy love,"
1251,6,"why it is thus, one knows in heaven above,"
1252,6,"but, a poor naiad, i guess not, farewel!"
1253,6,"i have a ditty for my hollow cell,"
1254,6,
1255,6," hereat, she vanished from endymion's gaze,"
1256,6,"who brooded o'er the water in amaze,"
1257,6,"the dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool"
1258,6,"lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,"
1259,6,"quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,"
1260,6,"and fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill"
1261,6,"had fallen out that hour, the wanderer,"
1262,6,"holding his forehead, to keep off the burr"
1263,6,"of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;"
1264,6,"and, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown"
1265,6,"glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,"
1266,6,"thus breath'd he to himself, whoso encamps"
1267,6,"to take a fancied city of delight,"
1268,6,"o what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,"
1269,6,"after long toil and travelling, to miss"
1270,6,"the kernel of his hopes, how more than vile,"
1271,6,"yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;"
1272,6,"another city doth he set about,"
1273,6,free from the smallest pebble-bead of doubt
1274,6,"that he will seize on trickling honey-combs,"
1275,6,"alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,"
1276,6,"and onward to another city speeds,"
1277,6,"but this is human life, the war, the deeds,"
1278,6,"the disappointment, the anxiety,"
1279,6,"imagination's struggles, far and nigh,"
1280,6,"all human; bearing in themselves this good,"
1281,6,"that they are sill the air, the subtle food,"
1282,6,"to make us feel existence, and to shew"
1283,6,"how quiet death is, where soil is men grow,"
1284,6,"whether to weeds or flowers; but for me,"
1285,6,"there is no depth to strike in, i can see"
1286,6,nought earthly worth my compassing; so stand
1287,6,"upon a misty, jutting head of land--"
1288,6,"alone? no, no; and by the orphean lute,"
1289,6,when mad eurydice is listening to 't;
1290,6,"i'd rather stand upon this misty peak,"
1291,6,"with not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,"
1292,6,"but the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,"
1293,6,"than be--i care not what, o meekest dove"
1294,6,"of heaven! o cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!"
1295,6,"from thy blue throne, now filling all the air,"
1296,6,glance but one little beam of temper'd light
1297,6,"into my bosom, that the dreadful might"
1298,6,and tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!
1299,6,"yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,"
1300,6,"would give a pang to jealous misery,"
1301,6,"worse than the torment's self, but rather tie"
1302,6,"large wings upon my shoulders, and point out"
1303,6,"my love's far dwelling, though the playful rout"
1304,6,"of cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,"
1305,6,"too keen in beauty, for thy silver prow"
1306,6,"not to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream,"
1307,6,"o be propitious, nor severely deem"
1308,6,"my madness impious; for, by all the stars"
1309,6,"that tend thy bidding, i do think the bars"
1310,6,that kept my spirit in are burst--that i
1311,6,am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!
1312,6,how beautiful thou art! the world how deep!
1313,6,how tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep
1314,6,"around their axle! then these gleaming reins,"
1315,6,how lithe! when this thy chariot attains
1316,6,"is airy goal, haply some bower veils"
1317,6,those twilight eyes? those eyes!--my spirit fails--
1318,6,"dear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air"
1319,6,"will gulph me--help!--at this with madden'd stare,"
1320,6,"and lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;"
1321,6,"like old deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,"
1322,6,"or blind orion hungry for the morn,"
1323,6,"and, but from the deep cavern there was borne"
1324,6,"a voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;"
1325,6,"nor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan"
1326,6,"had more been heard, thus swell'd it forth, descend,"
1327,6,young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend
1328,6,into the sparry hollows of the world!
1329,6,oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd
1330,6,"as from thy threshold, day by day hast been"
1331,6,a little lower than the chilly sheen
1332,6,"of icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms"
1333,6,into the deadening ether that still charms
1334,6,"their marble being, now, as deep profound"
1335,6,"as those are high, descend! he ne'er is crown'd"
1336,6,"with immortality, who fears to follow"
1337,6,"where airy voices lead, so through the hollow,"
1338,6,"the silent mysteries of earth, descend!"
1339,6,
1340,6," he heard but the last words, nor could contend"
1341,6,"one moment in reflection, for he fled"
1342,6,"into the fearful deep, to hide his head"
1343,6,"from the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness,"
1344,6,
1345,6," 'twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;"
1346,6,"sharpening, by degrees, his appetite"
1347,6,"to dive into the deepest, dark, nor light,"
1348,6,"the region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,"
1349,6,but mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;
1350,6,a dusky empire and its diadems;
1351,6,"one faint eternal eventide of gems,"
1352,6,"aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,"
1353,6,"along whose track the prince quick footsteps told,"
1354,6,"with all its lines abrupt and angular,"
1355,6,"out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,"
1356,6,"through a vast antre; then the metal woof,"
1357,6,"like vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof"
1358,6,"curves hugely, now, far in the deep abyss,"
1359,6,"it seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss"
1360,6,"fancy into belief, anon it leads"
1361,6,"through winding passages, where sameness breeds"
1362,6,vexing conceptions of some sudden change;
1363,6,"whether to silver grots, or giant range"
1364,6,"of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge"
1365,6,"athwart a flood of crystal, on a ridge"
1366,6,"now fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath"
1367,6,"towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth"
1368,6,"a hundred waterfalls, whose voices come"
1369,6,"but as the murmuring surge, chilly and numb"
1370,6,"his bosom grew, when first he, far away,"
1371,6,"descried an orbed diamond, set to fray"
1372,6,"old darkness from his throne, 'twas like the sun"
1373,6,"uprisen o'er chaos, and with such a stun"
1374,6,"came the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,"
1375,6,he saw not fiercer wonders--past the wit
1376,6,"of any spirit to tell, but one of those"
1377,6,"who, when this planet's sphering time doth close,"
1378,6,"will be its high remembrancers, who they?"
1379,6,the mighty ones who have made eternal day
1380,6,"for greece and england, while astonishment"
1381,6,"with deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went"
1382,6,"into a marble gallery, passing through"
1383,6,"a mimic temple, so complete and true"
1384,6,"in sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd"
1385,6,"to search it inwards, whence far off appear'd,"
1386,6,"through a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,"
1387,6,"and, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,"
1388,6,"a quiver'd dian, stepping awfully,"
1389,6,the youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye
1390,6,"down sidelong aisles, and into niches old,"
1391,6,"and when, more near against the marble cold"
1392,6,"he had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread"
1393,6,"all courts and passages, where silence dead"
1394,6,"rous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint,"
1395,6,"and long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint"
1396,6,"himself with every mystery, and awe;"
1397,6,"till, weary, he sat down before the maw"
1398,6,"of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim"
1399,6,"to wild uncertainty and shadows grim,"
1400,6,"there, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,"
1401,6,"and thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore"
1402,6,the journey homeward to habitual self!
1403,6,"a mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,"
1404,6,"whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,"
1405,6,"cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,"
1406,6,"into the bosom of a hated thing,"
1407,6,
1408,6, what misery most drowningly doth sing
1409,6,"in lone endymion's ear, now he has caught"
1410,6,"the goal of consciousness? ah, 'tis the thought,"
1411,6,"the deadly feel of solitude, for lo!"
1412,6,"he cannot see the heavens, nor the flow"
1413,6,"of rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild"
1414,6,"in pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,"
1415,6,"the cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,"
1416,6,"like herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest"
1417,6,"cool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;"
1418,6,but far from such companionship to wear
1419,6,"an unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,"
1420,6,"was now his lot, and must he patient stay,"
1421,6,tracing fantastic figures with his spear?
1422,6,"no! exclaimed he, why should i tarry here?"
1423,6,"no! loudly echoed times innumerable,"
1424,6,"at which he straightway started, and 'gan tell"
1425,6,his paces back into the temple's chief;
1426,6,warming and glowing strong in the belief
1427,6,"of help from dian, so that when again"
1428,6,"he caught her airy form, thus did he plain,"
1429,6,"moving more near the while, o haunter chaste"
1430,6,"of river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,"
1431,6,where with thy silver bow and arrows keen
1432,6,"art thou now forested? o woodland queen,"
1433,6,what smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?
1434,6,where dost thou listen to the wide halloos
1435,6,of thy disparted nymphs? through what dark tree
1436,6,"glimmers thy crescent? wheresoe'er it be,"
1437,6,"'tis in the breath of heaven, thou dost taste"
1438,6,"freedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste"
1439,6,thy loveliness in dismal elements;
1440,6,"but, finding in our green earth sweet contents,"
1441,6,"there livest blissfully, ah, if to thee"
1442,6,"it feels elysian, how rich to me,"
1443,6,"an exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!"
1444,6,within my breast there lives a choking flame--
1445,6,o let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!
1446,6,a homeward fever parches up my tongue--
1447,6,o let me slake it at the running springs!
1448,6,upon my ear a noisy nothing rings--
1449,6,o let me once more hear the linnet's note!
1450,6,before mine eyes thick films and shadows float--
1451,6,o let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!
1452,6,dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?
1453,6,o think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!
1454,6,dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?
1455,6,o think how this dry palate would rejoice!
1456,6,"if in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,"
1457,6,oh think how i should love a bed of flowers!--
1458,6,young goddess! let me see my native bowers!
1459,6,deliver me from this rapacious deep!
1460,6,
1461,6," thus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap"
1462,6,"his destiny, alert he stood, but when"
1463,6,"obstinate silence came heavily again,"
1464,6,feeling about for its old couch of space
1465,6,"and airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face"
1466,6,"desponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill,"
1467,6,"but 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill"
1468,6,"to its old channel, or a swollen tide"
1469,6,"to margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,"
1470,6,"and flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns"
1471,6,"up heaping through the slab, refreshment drowns"
1472,6,"itself, and strives its own delights to hide--"
1473,6,nor in one spot alone; the floral pride
1474,6,in a long whispering birth enchanted grew
1475,6,before his footsteps; as when heav'd anew
1476,6,"old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,"
1477,6,"down whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,"
1478,6,"bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence,"
1479,6,
1480,6," increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,"
1481,6,upon his fairy journey on he hastes;
1482,6,"so anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes"
1483,6,"one moment with his hand among the sweets,"
1484,6,onward he goes--he stops--his bosom beats
1485,6,"as plainly in his ear, as the faint charm"
1486,6,"of which the throbs were born, this still alarm,"
1487,6,"this sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe,"
1488,6,for it came more softly than the east could blow
1489,6,arion's magic to the atlantic isles;
1490,6,"or than the west, made jealous by the smiles"
1491,6,"of thron'd apollo, could breathe back the lyre"
1492,6,"to seas ionian and tyrian,"
1493,6,
1494,6," o did he ever live, that lonely man,"
1495,6,who lov'd--and music slew not? 'tis the pest
1496,6,"of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;"
1497,6,that things of delicate and tenderest worth
1498,6,"are swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,"
1499,6,"by one consuming flame, it doth immerse"
1500,6,"and suffocate true blessings in a curse,"
1501,6,"half-happy, by comparison of bliss,"
1502,6,"is miserable, 'twas even so with this"
1503,6,"dew-dropping melody, in the carian's ear;"
1504,6,"first heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,"
1505,6,"vanish'd in elemental passion,"
1506,6,
1507,6," and down some swart abysm he had gone,"
1508,6,had not a heavenly guide benignant led
1509,6,"to where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head"
1510,6,"brushing, awakened, then the sounds again"
1511,6,went noiseless as a passing noontide rain
1512,6,"over a bower, where little space he stood;"
1513,6,for as the sunset peeps into a wood
1514,6,"so saw he panting light, and towards it went"
1515,6,"through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!"
1516,6,"upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,"
1517,6,"cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair,"
1518,6,
1519,6," after a thousand mazes overgone,"
1520,6,"at last, with sudden step, he came upon"
1521,6,"a chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,"
1522,6,"full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,"
1523,6,"and more of beautiful and strange beside,"
1524,6,"for on a silken couch of rosy pride,"
1525,6,"in midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth"
1526,6,"of fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,"
1527,6,"than sighs could fathom, or contentment reach,"
1528,6,"and coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,"
1529,6,"or ripe october's faded marigolds,"
1530,6,fell sleek about him in a thousand folds--
1531,6,not hiding up an apollonian curve
1532,6,"of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve"
1533,6,"of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;"
1534,6,"but rather, giving them to the filled sight"
1535,6,"officiously, sideway his face repos'd"
1536,6,"on one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,"
1537,6,"by tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth"
1538,6,to slumbery pout; just as the morning south
1539,6,"disparts a dew-lipp'd rose, above his head,"
1540,6,four lily stalks did their white honours wed
1541,6,to make a coronal; and round him grew
1542,6,"all tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,"
1543,6,"together intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh,"
1544,6,"the vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,"
1545,6,"shading its ethiop berries; and woodbine,"
1546,6,of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;
1547,6,convolvulus in streaked vases flush;
1548,6,"the creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;"
1549,6,"and virgin's bower, trailing airily;"
1550,6,"with others of the sisterhood, hard by,"
1551,6,"stood serene cupids watching silently,"
1552,6,"one, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,"
1553,6,muffling to death the pathos with his wings;
1554,6,"and, ever and anon, uprose to look"
1555,6,at the youth's slumber; while another took
1556,6,"a willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,"
1557,6,and shook it on his hair; another flew
1558,6,"in through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise"
1559,6,"rain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes,"
1560,6,
1561,6," at these enchantments, and yet many more,"
1562,6,the breathless latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;
1563,6,"until, impatient in embarrassment,"
1564,6,"he forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went"
1565,6,"to that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,"
1566,6,"smiling, thus whisper'd, though from upper day"
1567,6,"thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here"
1568,6,"might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!"
1569,6,"for 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,"
1570,6,when some ethereal and high-favouring donor
1571,6,presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;
1572,6,"as now 'tis done to thee, endymion, hence"
1573,6,"was i in no wise startled, so recline"
1574,6,"upon these living flowers, here is wine,"
1575,6,"alive with sparkles--never, i aver,"
1576,6,"since ariadne was a vintager,"
1577,6,"so cool a purple, taste these juicy pears,"
1578,6,"sent me by sad vertumnus, when his fears"
1579,6,"were high about pomona, here is cream,"
1580,6,deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;
1581,6,sweeter than that nurse amalthea skimm'd
1582,6,"for the boy jupiter, and here, undimm'd"
1583,6,"by any touch, a bunch of blooming plums"
1584,6,"ready to melt between an infant's gums,"
1585,6,"and here is manna pick'd from syrian trees,"
1586,6,"in starlight, by the three hesperides,"
1587,6,"feast on, and meanwhile i will let thee know"
1588,6,"of all these things around us, he did so,"
1589,6,still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;
1590,6,"and thus, i need not any hearing tire"
1591,6,by telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd
1592,6,"for a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind"
1593,6,"him all in all unto her doting self,"
1594,6,"who would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,"
1595,6,he was content to let her amorous plea
1596,6,faint through his careless arms; content to see
1597,6,an unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;
1598,6,"content, o fool! to make a cold retreat,"
1599,6,"when on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,"
1600,6,lay sorrowing; when every tear was born
1601,6,of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes
1602,6,"were clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs"
1603,6,"came vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small,"
1604,6,"hush! no exclaim--yet, justly mightst thou call"
1605,6,"curses upon his head,--i was half glad,"
1606,6,"but my poor mistress went distract and mad,"
1607,6,"when the boar tusk'd him, so away she flew"
1608,6,"to jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew"
1609,6,immortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;
1610,6,"whereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd"
1611,6,"each summer time to life, lo! this is he,"
1612,6,"that same adonis, safe in the privacy"
1613,6,"of this still region all his winter-sleep,"
1614,6,"aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep"
1615,6,"over his waned corse, the tremulous shower"
1616,6,"heal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,"
1617,6,"medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness,"
1618,6,"the which she fills with visions, and doth dress"
1619,6,in all this quiet luxury; and hath set
1620,6,"us young immortals, without any let,"
1621,6,"to watch his slumber through, 'tis well nigh pass'd,"
1622,6,"even to a moment's filling up, and fast"
1623,6,"she scuds with summer breezes, to pant through"
1624,6,"the first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew"
1625,6,"embower'd sports in cytherea's isle,"
1626,6,look! how those winged listeners all this while
1627,6,"stand anxious, see! behold!--this clamant word"
1628,6,broke through the careful silence; for they heard
1629,6,"a rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd"
1630,6,"pigeons and doves, adonis something mutter'd,"
1631,6,"the while one hand, that erst upon his thigh"
1632,6,"lay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually"
1633,6,"up to his forehead, then there was a hum"
1634,6,"of sudden voices, echoing, come! come!"
1635,6,arise! awake! clear summer has forth walk'd
1636,6,"unto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd"
1637,6,"full soothingly to every nested finch,"
1638,6,"rise, cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch"
1639,6,"to your dimpled arms, once more sweet life begin!"
1640,6,"at this, from every side they hurried in,"
1641,6,"rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,"
1642,6,and doubling overhead their little fists
1643,6,"in backward yawns, but all were soon alive,"
1644,6,"for as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive"
1645,6,"in nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,"
1646,6,so from the arbour roof down swell'd an air
1647,6,odorous and enlivening; making all
1648,6,"to laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call"
1649,6,"for their sweet queen, when lo! the wreathed green"
1650,6,"disparted, and far upward could be seen"
1651,6,"blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,"
1652,6,"whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,"
1653,6,"spun off a drizzling dew,--which falling chill"
1654,6,"on soft adonis' shoulders, made him still"
1655,6,"nestle and turn uneasily about,"
1656,6,"soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,"
1657,6,and silken traces lighten'd in descent;
1658,6,"and soon, returning from love's banishment,"
1659,6,"queen venus leaning downward open arm'd,"
1660,6,"her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd"
1661,6,"a tumult to his heart, and a new life"
1662,6,"into his eyes, ah, miserable strife,"
1663,6,"but for her comforting! unhappy sight,"
1664,6,"but meeting her blue orbs! who, who can write"
1665,6,of these first minutes? the unchariest muse
1666,6,"to embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse,"
1667,6,
1668,6," o it has ruffled every spirit there,"
1669,6,"saving love's self, who stands superb to share"
1670,6,"the general gladness, awfully he stands;"
1671,6,a sovereign quell is in his waving hands;
1672,6,no sight can bear the lightning of his bow;
1673,6,"his quiver is mysterious, none can know"
1674,6,what themselves think of it; from forth his eyes
1675,6,"there darts strange light of varied hues and dyes,"
1676,6,"a scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who"
1677,6,look full upon it feel anon the blue
1678,6,"of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls,"
1679,6,"endymion feels it, and no more controls"
1680,6,"the burning prayer within him; so, bent low,"
1681,6,"he had begun a plaining of his woe,"
1682,6,"but venus, bending forward, said, my child,"
1683,6,favour this gentle youth; his days are wild
1684,6,with love--he--but alas! too well i see
1685,6,"thou know'st the deepness of his misery,"
1686,6,"ah, smile not so, my son, i tell thee true,"
1687,6,that when through heavy hours i used to rue
1688,6,"the endless sleep of this new-born adon',"
1689,6,"this stranger ay i pitied, for upon"
1690,6,a dreary morning once i fled away
1691,6,"into the breezy clouds, to weep and pray"
1692,6,"for this my love, for vexing mars had teaz'd"
1693,6,"me even to tears, thence, when a little eas'd,"
1694,6,"down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,"
1695,6,"i saw this youth as he despairing stood,"
1696,6,"those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind,"
1697,6,those same full fringed lids a constant blind
1698,6,"over his sullen eyes, i saw him throw"
1699,6,"himself on wither'd leaves, even as though"
1700,6,"death had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,"
1701,6,"yet mutter'd wildly, i could hear he lov'd"
1702,6,"some fair immortal, and that his embrace"
1703,6,"had zoned her through the night, there is no trace"
1704,6,"of this in heaven, i have mark'd each cheek,"
1705,6,and find it is the vainest thing to seek;
1706,6,"and that of all things 'tis kept secretest,"
1707,6,"endymion! one day thou wilt be blest,"
1708,6,so still obey the guiding hand that fends
1709,6,"thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends,"
1710,6,'tis a concealment needful in extreme;
1711,6,"and if i guess'd not so, the sunny beam"
1712,6,"thou shouldst mount up to with me, now adieu!"
1713,6,"here must we leave thee,--at these words up flew"
1714,6,"the impatient doves, up rose the floating car,"
1715,6,"up went the hum celestial, high afar"
1716,6,the latmian saw them minish into nought;
1717,6,"and, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught"
1718,6,"a vivid lightning from that dreadful bow,"
1719,6,"when all was darkened, with etnean throe"
1720,6,the earth clos'd--gave a solitary moan--
1721,6,"and left him once again in twilight lone,"
1722,6,
1723,6," he did not rave, he did not stare aghast,"
1724,6,"for all those visions were o'ergone, and past,"
1725,6,"and he in loneliness, he felt assur'd"
1726,6,"of happy times, when all he had endur'd"
1727,6,"would seem a feather to the mighty prize,"
1728,6,"so, with unusual gladness, on he hies"
1729,6,"through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,"
1730,6,"gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,"
1731,6,"black polish'd porticos of awful shade,"
1732,6,"and, at the last, a diamond balustrade,"
1733,6,"leading afar past wild magnificence,"
1734,6,"spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence"
1735,6,"stretching across a void, then guiding o'er"
1736,6,"enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,"
1737,6,streams subterranean tease their granite beds;
1738,6,then heighten'd just above the silvery heads
1739,6,"of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash"
1740,6,"the waters with his spear; but at the splash,"
1741,6,"done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose"
1742,6,"sudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose"
1743,6,"his diamond path with fretwork, streaming round"
1744,6,"alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,"
1745,6,"haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells"
1746,6,"welcome the float of thetis, long he dwells"
1747,6,"on this delight; for, every minute's space,"
1748,6,"the streams with changed magic interlace,"
1749,6,"sometimes like delicatest lattices,"
1750,6,"cover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,"
1751,6,"moving about as in a gentle wind,"
1752,6,"which, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,"
1753,6,"pour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,"
1754,6,"spangled, and rich with liquid broideries"
1755,6,"of flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair,"
1756,6,swifter than lightning went these wonders rare;
1757,6,"and then the water, into stubborn streams"
1758,6,"collecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,"
1759,6,"pillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,"
1760,6,of those dusk places in times far aloof
1761,6,"cathedrals call'd, he bade a loth farewel"
1762,6,"to these founts protean, passing gulph, and dell,"
1763,6,"and torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,"
1764,6,"half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,"
1765,6,"blackening on every side, and overhead"
1766,6,"a vaulted dome like heaven's, far bespread"
1767,6,"with starlight gems, aye, all so huge and strange,"
1768,6,the solitary felt a hurried change
1769,6,"working within him into something dreary,--"
1770,6,"vex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,"
1771,6,"and purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds,"
1772,6,"but he revives at once, for who beholds"
1773,6,"new sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?"
1774,6,"forth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,"
1775,6,came mother cybele! alone--alone--
1776,6,in sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown
1777,6,"about her majesty, and front death-pale,"
1778,6,"with turrets crown'd, four maned lions hale"
1779,6,"the sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,"
1780,6,"their surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws"
1781,6,"uplifted drowsily, and nervy tails"
1782,6,"cowering their tawny brushes, silent sails"
1783,6,"this shadowy queen athwart, and faints away"
1784,6,"in another gloomy arch,"
1785,6,
1786,6,"                         wherefore delay,"
1787,6,"young traveller, in such a mournful place?"
1788,6,"art thou wayworn, or canst not further trace"
1789,6,the diamond path? and does it indeed end
1790,6,abrupt in middle air? yet earthward bend
1791,6,"thy forehead, and to jupiter cloud-borne"
1792,6,call ardently! he was indeed wayworn;
1793,6,"abrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;"
1794,6,"to cloud-borne jove he bowed, and there crost"
1795,6,"towards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,"
1796,6,"without one impious word, himself he flings,"
1797,6,"committed to the darkness and the gloom,"
1798,6,"down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,"
1799,6,swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell
1800,6,"through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,"
1801,6,"and rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,"
1802,6,came swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd
1803,6,"so thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd"
1804,6,"large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd"
1805,6,"with airs delicious, in the greenest nook"
1806,6,"the eagle landed him, and farewel took,"
1807,6,
1808,6," it was a jasmine bower, all bestrown"
1809,6,"with golden moss, his every sense had grown"
1810,6,ethereal for pleasure; 'bove his head
1811,6,flew a delight half-graspable; his tread
1812,6,was hesperean; to his capable ears
1813,6,silence was music from the holy spheres;
1814,6,a dewy luxury was in his eyes;
1815,6,the little flowers felt his pleasant sighs
1816,6,"and stirr'd them faintly, verdant cave and cell"
1817,6,"he wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell"
1818,6,"of sudden exaltation, but, alas!"
1819,6,"said he, will all this gush of feeling pass"
1820,6,"away in solitude? and must they wane,"
1821,6,"like melodies upon a sandy plain,"
1822,6,without an echo? then shall i be left
1823,6,"so sad, so melancholy, so bereft!"
1824,6,"yet still i feel immortal! o my love,"
1825,6,"my breath of life, where art thou? high above,"
1826,6,dancing before the morning gates of heaven?
1827,6,"or keeping watch among those starry seven,"
1828,6,"old atlas' children? art a maid of the waters,"
1829,6,one of shell-winding triton's bright-hair'd daughters?
1830,6,"or art, impossible! a nymph of dian's,"
1831,6,weaving a coronal of tender scions
1832,6,"for very idleness? where'er thou art,"
1833,6,methinks it now is at my will to start
1834,6,"into thine arms; to scare aurora's train,"
1835,6,and snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main
1836,6,"to scud like a wild bird, and take thee off"
1837,6,from thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff
1838,6,"thy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves,"
1839,6,"no, no, too eagerly my soul deceives"
1840,6,"its powerless self, i know this cannot be,"
1841,6,o let me then by some sweet dreaming flee
1842,6,"to her entrancements, hither sleep awhile!"
1843,6,hither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil
1844,6,"for some few hours the coming solitude,"
1845,6,
1846,6," thus spake he, and that moment felt endued"
1847,6,with power to dream deliciously; so wound
1848,6,"through a dim passage, searching till he found"
1849,6,"the smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where"
1850,6,"he threw himself, and just into the air"
1851,6,"stretching his indolent arms, he took, o bliss!"
1852,6,"a naked waist, fair cupid, whence is this?"
1853,6,"a well-known voice sigh'd, sweetest, here am i!"
1854,6,"at which soft ravishment, with doating cry"
1855,6,"they trembled to each other,--helicon!"
1856,6,o fountain'd hill! old homer's helicon!
1857,6,that thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er
1858,6,these sorry pages; then the verse would soar
1859,6,"and sing above this gentle pair, like lark"
1860,6,"over his nested young, but all is dark"
1861,6,"around thine aged top, and thy clear fount"
1862,6,"exhales in mists to heaven, aye, the count"
1863,6,of mighty poets is made up; the scroll
1864,6,is folded by the muses; the bright roll
1865,6,"is in apollo's hand, our dazed eyes"
1866,6,"have seen a new tinge in the western skies,"
1867,6,"the world has done its duty, yet, oh yet,"
1868,6,"although the sun of poesy is set,"
1869,6,"these lovers did embrace, and we must weep"
1870,6,that there is no old power left to steep
1871,6,"a quill immortal in their joyous tears,"
1872,6,long time in silence did their anxious fears
1873,6,question that thus it was; long time they lay
1874,6,fondling and kissing every doubt away;
1875,6,long time ere soft caressing sobs began
1876,6,"to mellow into words, and then there ran"
1877,6,"two bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips,"
1878,6,o known unknown! from whom my being sips
1879,6,"such darling essence, wherefore may i not"
1880,6,be ever in these arms? in this sweet spot
1881,6,pillow my chin for ever? ever press
1882,6,these toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?
1883,6,why not for ever and for ever feel
1884,6,"that breath about my eyes? ah, thou wilt steal"
1885,6,"away from me again, indeed, indeed--"
1886,6,"thou wilt be gone away, and wilt not heed"
1887,6,"my lonely madness, speak, my kindest fair!"
1888,6,is--is it to be so? no! who will dare
1889,6,"to pluck thee from me? and, of thine own will,"
1890,6,"full well i feel thou wouldst not leave me, still"
1891,6,"let me entwine thee surer, surer--now"
1892,6,how can we part? elysium! who art thou?
1893,6,"who, that thou canst not be for ever here,"
1894,6,or lift me with thee to some starry sphere?
1895,6,"enchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,"
1896,6,"by the most soft completion of thy face,"
1897,6,"those lips, o slippery blisses, twinkling eyes,"
1898,6,"and by these tenderest, milky sovereignties--"
1899,6,"these tenderest, and by the nectar-wine,"
1900,6,the passion--------o lov'd ida the divine!
1901,6,"endymion! dearest! ah, unhappy me!"
1902,6,his soul will 'scape us--o felicity!
1903,6,how he does love me! his poor temples beat
1904,6,"to the very tune of love--how sweet, sweet, sweet,"
1905,6,"revive, dear youth, or i shall faint and die;"
1906,6,"revive, or these soft hours will hurry by"
1907,6,"in tranced dulness; speak, and let that spell"
1908,6,affright this lethargy! i cannot quell
1909,6,"its heavy pressure, and will press at least"
1910,6,"my lips to thine, that they may richly feast"
1911,6,"until we taste the life of love again,"
1912,6,what! dost thou move? dost kiss? o bliss! o pain!
1913,6,"i love thee, youth, more than i can conceive;"
1914,6,and so long absence from thee doth bereave
1915,6,"my soul of any rest, yet must i hence,"
1916,6,"yet, can i not to starry eminence"
1917,6,uplift thee; nor for very shame can own
1918,6,"myself to thee, ah, dearest, do not groan"
1919,6,"or thou wilt force me from this secrecy,"
1920,6,"and i must blush in heaven, o that i"
1921,6,had done it already; that the dreadful smiles
1922,6,"at my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,"
1923,6,"had waned from olympus' solemn height,"
1924,6,and from all serious gods; that our delight
1925,6,"was quite forgotten, save of us alone!"
1926,6,and wherefore so ashamed? 'tis but to atone
1927,6,"for endless pleasure, by some coward blushes,"
1928,6,yet must i be a coward!--horror rushes
1929,6,too palpable before me--the sad look
1930,6,of jove--minerva's start--no bosom shook
1931,6,with awe of purity--no cupid pinion
1932,6,in reverence veiled--my crystaline dominion
1933,6,"half lost, and all old hymns made nullity!"
1934,6,but what is this to love? o i could fly
1935,6,"with thee into the ken of heavenly powers,"
1936,6,"so thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,"
1937,6,"press me so sweetly, now i swear at once"
1938,6,"that i am wise, that pallas is a dunce--"
1939,6,perhaps her love like mine is but unknown--
1940,6,o i do think that i have been alone
1941,6,"in chastity, yes, pallas has been sighing,"
1942,6,while every eve saw me my hair uptying
1943,6,"with fingers cool as aspen leaves, sweet love,"
1944,6,"i was as vague as solitary dove,"
1945,6,"nor knew that nests were built, now a soft kiss--"
1946,6,"aye, by that kiss, i vow an endless bliss,"
1947,6,"an immortality of passion's thine,"
1948,6,ere long i will exalt thee to the shine
1949,6,of heaven ambrosial; and we will shade
1950,6,ourselves whole summers by a river glade;
1951,6,"and i will tell thee stories of the sky,"
1952,6,"and breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy,"
1953,6,my happy love will overwing all bounds!
1954,6,o let me melt into thee; let the sounds
1955,6,of our close voices marry at their birth;
1956,6,let us entwine hoveringly--o dearth
1957,6,of human words! roughness of mortal speech!
1958,6,lispings empyrean will i sometime teach
1959,6,"thine honied tongue--lute-breathings, which i gasp"
1960,6,"to have thee understand, now while i clasp"
1961,6,"thee thus, and weep for fondness--i am pain'd,"
1962,6,"endymion, woe! woe! is grief contain'd"
1963,6,"in the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?--"
1964,6,"hereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife"
1965,6,"melted into a languor, he return'd"
1966,6,"entranced vows and tears,"
1967,6,
1968,6,                         ye who have yearn'd
1969,6,"with too much passion, will here stay and pity,"
1970,6,for the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty
1971,6,"not of these days, but long ago 'twas told"
1972,6,by a cavern wind unto a forest old;
1973,6,and then the forest told it in a dream
1974,6,"to a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam"
1975,6,a poet caught as he was journeying
1976,6,to phoebus' shrine; and in it he did fling
1977,6,"his weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,"
1978,6,"and after, straight in that inspired place"
1979,6,"he sang the story up into the air,"
1980,6,"giving it universal freedom, there"
1981,6,has it been ever sounding for those ears
1982,6,"whose tips are glowing hot, the legend cheers"
1983,6,yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it
1984,6,"must surely be self-doomed or he will rue it,"
1985,6,"for quenchless burnings come upon the heart,"
1986,6,made fiercer by a fear lest any part
1987,6,"should be engulphed in the eddying wind,"
1988,6,as much as here is penn'd doth always find
1989,6,"a resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;"
1990,6,anon the strange voice is upon the wane--
1991,6,"and 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,"
1992,6,that the fair visitant at last unwound
1993,6,"her gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep,--"
1994,6,"thus the tradition of the gusty deep,"
1995,6,
1996,6," now turn we to our former chroniclers,--"
1997,6,"endymion awoke, that grief of hers"
1998,6,"sweet paining on his ear, he sickly guess'd"
1999,6,"how lone he was once more, and sadly press'd"
2000,6,"his empty arms together, hung his head,"
2001,6,and most forlorn upon that widow'd bed
2002,6,"sat silently, love's madness he had known,"
2003,6,often with more than tortured lion's groan
2004,6,moanings had burst from him; but now that rage
2005,6,"had pass'd away, no longer did he wage"
2006,6,"a rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars,"
2007,6,"no, he had felt too much for such harsh jars,"
2008,6,the lyre of his soul eolian tun'd
2009,6,"forgot all violence, and but commun'd"
2010,6,"with melancholy thought, o he had swoon'd"
2011,6,drunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love
2012,6,"henceforth was dove-like,--loth was he to move"
2013,6,"from the imprinted couch, and when he did,"
2014,6,"'twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid"
2015,6,"in muffling hands, so temper'd, out he stray'd"
2016,6,half seeing visions that might have dismay'd
2017,6,alecto's serpents; ravishments more keen
2018,6,"than hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean"
2019,6,"over eclipsing eyes, and at the last"
2020,6,"it was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,"
2021,6,"o'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,"
2022,6,"and crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,"
2023,6,"of every shape and size, even to the bulk"
2024,6,"in which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk"
2025,6,"against an endless storm, moreover too,"
2026,6,"fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,"
2027,6,"ready to snort their streams, in this cool wonder"
2028,6,"endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder"
2029,6,"on all his life, his youth, up to the day"
2030,6,"when 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,"
2031,6,"he stept upon his shepherd throne, the look"
2032,6,"of his white palace in wild forest nook,"
2033,6,"and all the revels he had lorded there,"
2034,6,"each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,"
2035,6,with every friend and fellow-woodlander--
2036,6,"pass'd like a dream before him, then the spur"
2037,6,"of the old bards to mighty deeds, his plans"
2038,6,"to nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans,"
2039,6,"that wondrous night, the great pan-festival,"
2040,6,"his sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,"
2041,6,"until into the earth's deep maw he rush'd,"
2042,6,"then all its buried magic, till it flush'd"
2043,6,"high with excessive love, and now, thought he,"
2044,6,how long must i remain in jeopardy
2045,6,of blank amazements that amaze no more?
2046,6,now i have tasted her sweet soul to the core
2047,6,"all other depths are shallow, essences,"
2048,6,"once spiritual, are like muddy lees,"
2049,6,"meant but to fertilize my earthly root,"
2050,6,and make my branches lift a golden fruit
2051,6,"into the bloom of heaven, other light,"
2052,6,though it be quick and sharp enough to blight
2053,6,"the olympian eagle's vision, is dark,"
2054,6,"dark as the parentage of chaos, hark!"
2055,6,my silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;
2056,6,"or they are but the ghosts, the dying swells"
2057,6,of noises far away?--list!--hereupon
2058,6,"he kept an anxious ear, the humming tone"
2059,6,"came louder, and behold, there as he lay,"
2060,6,"on either side outgush'd, with misty spray,"
2061,6,a copious spring; and both together dash'd
2062,6,"swift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd"
2063,6,"among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,"
2064,6,"leaving a trickling dew, at last they shot"
2065,6,"down from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise"
2066,6,as of some breathless racers whose hopes poize
2067,6,"upon the last few steps, and with spent force"
2068,6,"along the ground they took a winding course,"
2069,6,endymion follow'd--for it seem'd that one
2070,6,"ever pursued, the other strove to shun--"
2071,6,"follow'd their languid mazes, till well nigh"
2072,6,"he had left thinking of the mystery,--"
2073,6,and was now rapt in tender hoverings
2074,6,"over the vanish'd bliss, ah! what is it sings"
2075,6,his dream away? what melodies are these?
2076,6,"they sound as through the whispering of trees,"
2077,6,"not native in such barren vaults, give ear!"
2078,6,
2079,6," o arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear"
2080,6,"such tenderness as mine? great dian, why,"
2081,6,why didst thou hear her prayer? o that i
2082,6,"were rippling round her dainty fairness now,"
2083,6,"circling about her waist, and striving how"
2084,6,to entice her to a dive! then stealing in
2085,6,"between her luscious lips and eyelids thin,"
2086,6,"o that her shining hair was in the sun,"
2087,6,and i distilling from it thence to run
2088,6,in amorous rillets down her shrinking form!
2089,6,"to linger on her lily shoulders, warm"
2090,6,"between her kissing breasts, and every charm"
2091,6,"touch raptur'd!--see how painfully i flow,"
2092,6,"fair maid, be pitiful to my great woe,"
2093,6,"stay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,"
2094,6,"a happy wooer, to the flowery mead"
2095,6,"where all that beauty snar'd me,--cruel god,"
2096,6,desist! or my offended mistress' nod
2097,6,"will stagnate all thy fountains,--tease me not"
2098,6,"with syren words--ah, have i really got"
2099,6,such power to madden thee? and is it true--
2100,6,"away, away, or i shall dearly rue"
2101,6,"my very thoughts, in mercy then away,"
2102,6,kindest alpheus for should i obey
2103,6,"my own dear will, 'twould be a deadly bane,--"
2104,6,"o, oread-queen! would that thou hadst a pain"
2105,6,"like this of mine, then would i fearless turn"
2106,6,"and be a criminal,--alas, i burn,"
2107,6,"i shudder--gentle river, get thee hence,"
2108,6,alpheus! thou enchanter! every sense
2109,6,"of mine was once made perfect in these woods,"
2110,6,"fresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,"
2111,6,"ripe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;"
2112,6,but ever since i heedlessly did lave
2113,6,"in thy deceitful stream, a panting glow"
2114,6,"grew strong within me, wherefore serve me so,"
2115,6,"and call it love? alas, 'twas cruelty,"
2116,6,not once more did i close my happy eyes
2117,6,"amid the thrush's song, away! avaunt!"
2118,6,"o 'twas a cruel thing,--now thou dost taunt"
2119,6,"so softly, arethusa, that i think"
2120,6,"if thou wast playing on my shady brink,"
2121,6,"thou wouldst bathe once again, innocent maid!"
2122,6,stifle thine heart no more;--nor be afraid
2123,6,"of angry powers, there are deities"
2124,6,"will shade us with their wings, those fitful sighs"
2125,6,"'tis almost death to hear, o let me pour"
2126,6,"a dewy balm upon them!--fear no more,"
2127,6,sweet arethusa! dian's self must feel
2128,6,"sometimes these very pangs, dear maiden, steal"
2129,6,"blushing into my soul, and let us fly"
2130,6,"these dreary caverns for the open sky,"
2131,6,"i will delight thee all my winding course,"
2132,6,from the green sea up to my hidden source
2133,6,about arcadian forests; and will shew
2134,6,the channels where my coolest waters flow
2135,6,"through mossy rocks; where, 'mid exuberant green,"
2136,6,"i roam in pleasant darkness, more unseen"
2137,6,than saturn in his exile; where i brim
2138,6,"round flowery islands, and take thence a skim"
2139,6,"of mealy sweets, which myriads of bees"
2140,6,"buzz from their honied wings, and thou shouldst please"
2141,6,"thyself to choose the richest, where we might"
2142,6,"be incense-pillow'd every summer night,"
2143,6,"doff all sad fears, thou white deliciousness,"
2144,6,and let us be thus comforted; unless
2145,6,thou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream
2146,6,"hurry distracted from sol's temperate beam,"
2147,6,"and pour to death along some hungry sands,--"
2148,6,"what can i do, alpheus? dian stands"
2149,6,"severe before me, persecuting fate!"
2150,6,unhappy arethusa! thou wast late
2151,6,"a huntress free in--at this, sudden fell"
2152,6,"those two sad streams adown a fearful dell,"
2153,6,"the latmian listen'd, but he heard no more,"
2154,6,"save echo, faint repeating o'er and o'er"
2155,6,"the name of arethusa, on the verge"
2156,6,"of that dark gulph he wept, and said, i urge"
2157,6,"thee, gentle goddess of my pilgrimage,"
2158,6,"by our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,"
2159,6,"if thou art powerful, these lovers pains;"
2160,6,"and make them happy in some happy plains,"
2161,6,
2162,6," he turn'd--there was a whelming sound--he stept,"
2163,6,there was a cooler light; and so he kept
2164,6,"towards it by a sandy path, and lo!"
2165,6,"more suddenly than doth a moment go,"
2166,6,the visions of the earth were gone and fled--
2167,6,"he saw the giant sea above his head,"
2168,7,there are who lord it o'er their fellow-men
2169,7,"with most prevailing tinsel, who unpen"
2170,7,"their baaing vanities, to browse away"
2171,7,the comfortable green and juicy hay
2172,7,"from human pastures; or, o torturing fact!"
2173,7,"who, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd"
2174,7,fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe
2175,7,"our gold and ripe-ear'd hopes, with not one tinge"
2176,7,"of sanctuary splendour, not a sight"
2177,7,"able to face an owl's, they still are dight"
2178,7,"by the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,"
2179,7,"and crowns, and turbans, with unladen breasts,"
2180,7,"save of blown self-applause, they proudly mount"
2181,7,"to their spirit's perch, their being's high account,"
2182,7,"their tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones--"
2183,7,amid the fierce intoxicating tones
2184,7,"of trumpets, shoutings, and belabour'd drums,"
2185,7,"and sudden cannon, ah! how all this hums,"
2186,7,"in wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone--"
2187,7,"like thunder clouds that spake to babylon,"
2188,7,"and set those old chaldeans to their tasks,--"
2189,7,are then regalities all gilded masks?
2190,7,"no, there are throned seats unscalable"
2191,7,"but by a patient wing, a constant spell,"
2192,7,"or by ethereal things that, unconfin'd,"
2193,7,"can make a ladder of the eternal wind,"
2194,7,and poise about in cloudy thunder-tents
2195,7,"to watch the abysm-birth of elements,"
2196,7,"aye, 'bove the withering of old-lipp'd fate"
2197,7,"a thousand powers keep religious state,"
2198,7,"in water, fiery realm, and airy bourne;"
2199,7,"and, silent as a consecrated urn,"
2200,7,"hold sphery sessions for a season due,"
2201,7,"yet few of these far majesties, ah, few!"
2202,7,have bared their operations to this globe--
2203,7,"few, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe"
2204,7,our piece of heaven--whose benevolence
2205,7,shakes hand with our own ceres; every sense
2206,7,"filling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,"
2207,7,"as bees gorge full their cells, and, by the feud"
2208,7,"'twixt nothing and creation, i here swear,"
2209,7,eterne apollo! that thy sister fair
2210,7,"is of all these the gentlier-mightiest,"
2211,7,"when thy gold breath is misting in the west,"
2212,7,"she unobserved steals unto her throne,"
2213,7,and there she sits most meek and most alone;
2214,7,as if she had not pomp subservient;
2215,7,"as if thine eye, high poet! was not bent"
2216,7,towards her with the muses in thine heart;
2217,7,"as if the ministring stars kept not apart,"
2218,7,"waiting for silver-footed messages,"
2219,7,o moon! the oldest shades 'mong oldest trees
2220,7,"feel palpitations when thou lookest in,"
2221,7,o moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din
2222,7,"the while they feel thine airy fellowship,"
2223,7,"thou dost bless every where, with silver lip"
2224,7,"kissing dead things to life, the sleeping kine,"
2225,7,"couched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine,"
2226,7,"innumerable mountains rise, and rise,"
2227,7,ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes;
2228,7,and yet thy benediction passeth not
2229,7,"one obscure hiding-place, one little spot"
2230,7,"where pleasure may be sent, the nested wren"
2231,7,"has thy fair face within its tranquil ken,"
2232,7,and from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf
2233,7,takes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief
2234,7,"to the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps"
2235,7,"within its pearly house,--the mighty deeps,"
2236,7,the monstrous sea is thine--the myriad sea!
2237,7,"o moon! far-spooming ocean bows to thee,"
2238,7,"and tellus feels his forehead's cumbrous load,"
2239,7,
2240,7, cynthia! where art thou now? what far abode
2241,7,of green or silvery bower doth enshrine
2242,7,"such utmost beauty? alas, thou dost pine"
2243,7,"for one as sorrowful, thy cheek is pale"
2244,7,"for one whose cheek is pale, thou dost bewail"
2245,7,"his tears, who weeps for thee, where dost thou sigh?"
2246,7,"ah! surely that light peeps from vesper's eye,"
2247,7,"or what a thing is love! 'tis she, but lo!"
2248,7,"how chang'd, how full of ache, how gone in woe!"
2249,7,she dies at the thinnest cloud; her loveliness
2250,7,"is wan on neptune's blue, yet there's a stress"
2251,7,"of love-spangles, just off yon cape of trees,"
2252,7,"dancing upon the waves, as if to please"
2253,7,"the curly foam with amorous influence,"
2254,7,"o, not so idle, for down-glancing thence"
2255,7,"she fathoms eddies, and runs wild about"
2256,7,o'erwhelming water-courses; scaring out
2257,7,"the thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright'ning"
2258,7,"their savage eyes with unaccustomed lightning,"
2259,7,where will the splendor be content to reach?
2260,7,o love! how potent hast thou been to teach
2261,7,"strange journeyings! wherever beauty dwells,"
2262,7,"in gulf or aerie, mountains or deep dells,"
2263,7,"in light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,"
2264,7,"thou pointest out the way, and straight 'tis won,"
2265,7,amid his toil thou gav'st leander breath;
2266,7,thou leddest orpheus through the gleams of death;
2267,7,thou madest pluto bear thin element;
2268,7,"and now, o winged chieftain! thou hast sent"
2269,7,"a moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,"
2270,7,"to find endymion,"
2271,7,
2272,7,                 on gold sand impearl'd
2273,7,"with lily shells, and pebbles milky white,"
2274,7,"poor cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light"
2275,7,"against his pallid face, he felt the charm"
2276,7,"to breathlessness, and suddenly a warm"
2277,7,"of his heart's blood, 'twas very sweet; he stay'd"
2278,7,"his wandering steps, and half-entranced laid"
2279,7,"his head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,"
2280,7,"to taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,"
2281,7,"lashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails,"
2282,7,"and so he kept, until the rosy veils"
2283,7,"mantling the east, by aurora's peering hand"
2284,7,"were lifted from the water's breast, and fann'd"
2285,7,into sweet air; and sober'd morning came
2286,7,"meekly through billows,--when like taper-flame"
2287,7,"left sudden by a dallying breath of air,"
2288,7,"he rose in silence, and once more 'gan fare"
2289,7,"along his fated way,"
2290,7,
2291,7,"                     far had he roam'd,"
2292,7,"with nothing save the hollow vast, that foam'd"
2293,7,"above, around, and at his feet; save things"
2294,7,"more dead than morpheus' imaginings,"
2295,7,"old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large"
2296,7,of gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;
2297,7,rudders that for a hundred years had lost
2298,7,the sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd
2299,7,"with long-forgotten story, and wherein"
2300,7,no reveller had ever dipp'd a chin
2301,7,"but those of saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,"
2302,7,"writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls"
2303,7,who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude
2304,7,"in ponderous stone, developing the mood"
2305,7,"of ancient nox;--then skeletons of man,"
2306,7,"of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,"
2307,7,"and elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw"
2308,7,"of nameless monster, a cold leaden awe"
2309,7,these secrets struck into him; and unless
2310,7,"dian had chaced away that heaviness,"
2311,7,"he might have died, but now, with cheered feel,"
2312,7,he onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal
2313,7,"about the labyrinth in his soul of love,"
2314,7,
2315,7," what is there in thee, moon! that thou shouldst move"
2316,7,my heart so potently? when yet a child
2317,7,"i oft have dried my tears when thou hast smil'd,"
2318,7,"thou seem'dst my sister, hand in hand we went"
2319,7,"from eve to morn across the firmament,"
2320,7,"no apples would i gather from the tree,"
2321,7,"till thou hadst cool'd their cheeks deliciously,"
2322,7,"no tumbling water ever spake romance,"
2323,7,"but when my eyes with thine thereon could dance,"
2324,7,"no woods were green enough, no bower divine,"
2325,7,"until thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine,"
2326,7,"in sowing time ne'er would i dibble take,"
2327,7,"or drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;"
2328,7,"and, in the summer tide of blossoming,"
2329,7,no one but thee hath heard me blithly sing
2330,7,"and mesh my dewy flowers all the night,"
2331,7,no melody was like a passing spright
2332,7,"if it went not to solemnize thy reign,"
2333,7,"yes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain"
2334,7,by thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;
2335,7,"and as i grew in years, still didst thou blend"
2336,7,"with all my ardours, thou wast the deep glen;"
2337,7,thou wast the mountain-top--the sage's pen--
2338,7,the poet's harp--the voice of friends--the sun;
2339,7,thou wast the river--thou wast glory won;
2340,7,thou wast my clarion's blast--thou wast my steed--
2341,7,"my goblet full of wine--my topmost deed,--"
2342,7,"thou wast the charm of women, lovely moon!"
2343,7,o what a wild and harmonized tune
2344,7,my spirit struck from all the beautiful!
2345,7,"on some bright essence could i lean, and lull"
2346,7,"myself to immortality, i prest"
2347,7,"nature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest,"
2348,7,"but, gentle orb! there came a nearer bliss--"
2349,7,my strange love came--felicity's abyss!
2350,7,"she came, and thou didst fade, and fade away--"
2351,7,"yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway"
2352,7,"has been an under-passion to this hour,"
2353,7,now i begin to feel thine orby power
2354,7,"is coming fresh upon me, o be kind,"
2355,7,"keep back thine influence, and do not blind"
2356,7,"my sovereign vision,--dearest love, forgive"
2357,7,that i can think away from thee and live!--
2358,7,"pardon me, airy planet, that i prize"
2359,7,one thought beyond thine argent luxuries!
2360,7,how far beyond! at this a surpris'd start
2361,7,frosted the springing verdure of his heart;
2362,7,for as he lifted up his eyes to swear
2363,7,"how his own goddess was past all things fair,"
2364,7,he saw far in the concave green of the sea
2365,7,"an old man sitting calm and peacefully,"
2366,7,"upon a weeded rock this old man sat,"
2367,7,"and his white hair was awful, and a mat"
2368,7,of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;
2369,7,"and, ample as the largest winding-sheet,"
2370,7,"a cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,"
2371,7,o'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans
2372,7,"of ambitious magic, every ocean-form"
2373,7,"was woven in with black distinctness; storm,"
2374,7,"and calm, and whispering, and hideous roar"
2375,7,were emblem'd in the woof; with every shape
2376,7,"that skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape,"
2377,7,"the gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,"
2378,7,"yet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell"
2379,7,to its huge self; and the minutest fish
2380,7,"would pass the very hardest gazer's wish,"
2381,7,"and show his little eye's anatomy,"
2382,7,then there was pictur'd the regality
2383,7,"of neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,"
2384,7,"in beauteous vassalage, look up and wait,"
2385,7,"beside this old man lay a pearly wand,"
2386,7,"and in his lap a book, the which he conn'd"
2387,7,"so stedfastly, that the new denizen"
2388,7,"had time to keep him in amazed ken,"
2389,7,"to mark these shadowings, and stand in awe,"
2390,7,
2391,7, the old man rais'd his hoary head and saw
2392,7,"the wilder'd stranger--seeming not to see,"
2393,7,"his features were so lifeless, suddenly"
2394,7,he woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows
2395,7,"went arching up, and like two magic ploughs"
2396,7,"furrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,"
2397,7,"which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,"
2398,7,"till round his wither'd lips had gone a smile,"
2399,7,"then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil"
2400,7,"had watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,"
2401,7,who had not from mid-life to utmost age
2402,7,"eas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,"
2403,7,"even to the trees, he rose, he grasp'd his stole,"
2404,7,"with convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,"
2405,7,"and in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd"
2406,7,"echo into oblivion, he said,--"
2407,7,
2408,7, thou art the man! now shall i lay my head
2409,7,"in peace upon my watery pillow, now"
2410,7,"sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow,"
2411,7,"o jove! i shall be young again, be young!"
2412,7,"o shell-borne neptune, i am pierc'd and stung"
2413,7,"with new-born life! what shall i do? where go,"
2414,7,when i have cast this serpent-skin of woe?--
2415,7,"i'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen"
2416,7,"their melodies, and see their long hair glisten;"
2417,7,"anon upon that giant's arm i'll be,"
2418,7,"that writhes about the roots of sicily,"
2419,7,"to northern seas i'll in a twinkling sail,"
2420,7,and mount upon the snortings of a whale
2421,7,to some black cloud; thence down i'll madly sweep
2422,7,"on forked lightning, to the deepest deep,"
2423,7,where through some sucking pool i will be hurl'd
2424,7,with rapture to the other side of the world!
2425,7,"o, i am full of gladness! sisters three,"
2426,7,i bow full hearted to your old decree!
2427,7,"yes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,"
2428,7,"for i no more shall wither, droop, and pine,"
2429,7,thou art the man! endymion started back
2430,7,"dismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack"
2431,7,"tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,"
2432,7,"mutter'd, what lonely death am i to die"
2433,7,"in this cold region? will he let me freeze,"
2434,7,and float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?
2435,7,"or will he touch me with his searing hand,"
2436,7,and leave a black memorial on the sand?
2437,7,"or tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,"
2438,7,and keep me as a chosen food to draw
2439,7,his magian fish through hated fire and flame?
2440,7,"o misery of hell! resistless, tame,"
2441,7,"am i to be burnt up? no, i will shout,"
2442,7,until the gods through heaven's blue look out!--
2443,7,o tartarus! but some few days agone
2444,7,"her soft arms were entwining me, and on"
2445,7,"her voice i hung like fruit among green leaves,"
2446,7,"her lips were all my own, and--ah, ripe sheaves"
2447,7,"of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,"
2448,7,"but never may be garner'd, i must stoop"
2449,7,"my head, and kiss death's foot, love! love, farewel!"
2450,7,is there no hope from thee? this horrid spell
2451,7,"would melt at thy sweet breath,--by dian's hind"
2452,7,"feeding from her white fingers, on the wind"
2453,7,"i see thy streaming hair! and now, by pan,"
2454,7,i care not for this old mysterious man!
2455,7,
2456,7," he spake, and walking to that aged form,"
2457,7,"look'd high defiance, lo! his heart 'gan warm"
2458,7,"with pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept,"
2459,7,had he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?
2460,7,"had he, though blindly contumelious, brought"
2461,7,"rheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,"
2462,7,convulsion to a mouth of many years?
2463,7,"he had in truth; and he was ripe for tears,"
2464,7,"the penitent shower fell, as down he knelt"
2465,7,"before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt"
2466,7,"about his large dark locks, and faultering spake,"
2467,7,
2468,7," arise, good youth, for sacred phoebus' sake!"
2469,7,"i know thine inmost bosom, and i feel"
2470,7,a very brother's yearning for thee steal
2471,7,"into mine own, for why? thou openest"
2472,7,the prison gates that have so long opprest
2473,7,"my weary watching, though thou know'st it not,"
2474,7,thou art commission'd to this fated spot
2475,7,"for great enfranchisement, o weep no more;"
2476,7,"i am a friend to love, to loves of yore,"
2477,7,"aye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power"
2478,7,i had been grieving at this joyous hour
2479,7,"but even now most miserable old,"
2480,7,"i saw thee, and my blood no longer cold"
2481,7,"gave mighty pulses, in this tottering case"
2482,7,"grew a new heart, which at this moment plays"
2483,7,"as dancingly as thine, be not afraid,"
2484,7,"for thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,"
2485,7,"now as we speed towards our joyous task,"
2486,7,
2487,7," so saying, this young soul in age's mask"
2488,7,"went forward with the carian side by side,"
2489,7,resuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide
2490,7,"hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands"
2491,7,"took silently their foot-prints, my soul stands"
2492,7,"now past the midway from mortality,"
2493,7,and so i can prepare without a sigh
2494,7,"to tell thee briefly all my joy and pain,"
2495,7,"i was a fisher once, upon this main,"
2496,7,and my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;
2497,7,"rough billows were my home by night and day,--"
2498,7,the sea-gulls not more constant; for i had
2499,7,"no housing from the storm and tempests mad,"
2500,7,"but hollow rocks,--and they were palaces"
2501,7,"of silent happiness, of slumberous ease,"
2502,7,"long years of misery have told me so,"
2503,7,"aye, thus it was one thousand years ago,"
2504,7,one thousand years!--is it then possible
2505,7,to look so plainly through them? to dispel
2506,7,a thousand years with backward glance sublime?
2507,7,to breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime
2508,7,"from off a crystal pool, to see its deep,"
2509,7,and one's own image from the bottom peep?
2510,7,"yes, now i am no longer wretched thrall,"
2511,7,my long captivity and moanings all
2512,7,"are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,"
2513,7,"the which i breathe away, and thronging come"
2514,7,"like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures,"
2515,7,
2516,7," i touch'd no lute, i sang not, trod no measures,"
2517,7,"i was a lonely youth on desert shores,"
2518,7,"my sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,"
2519,7,"and craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry"
2520,7,"plaining discrepant between sea and sky,"
2521,7,dolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen
2522,7,"would let me feel their scales of gold and green,"
2523,7,"nor be my desolation; and, full oft,"
2524,7,when a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft
2525,7,"its hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe"
2526,7,"to burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe"
2527,7,"my life away like a vast sponge of fate,"
2528,7,"some friendly monster, pitying my sad state,"
2529,7,"has dived to its foundations, gulph'd it down,"
2530,7,"and left me tossing safely, but the crown"
2531,7,"of all my life was utmost quietude,"
2532,7,"more did i love to lie in cavern rude,"
2533,7,"keeping in wait whole days for neptune's voice,"
2534,7,"and if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!"
2535,7,there blush'd no summer eve but i would steer
2536,7,"my skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear"
2537,7,"the shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,"
2538,7,"mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep,"
2539,7,"and never was a day of summer shine,"
2540,7,"but i beheld its birth upon the brine,"
2541,7,for i would watch all night to see unfold
2542,7,"heaven's gates, and aethon snort his morning gold"
2543,7,"wide o'er the swelling streams, and constantly"
2544,7,"at brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,"
2545,7,"my nets would be spread out, and i at rest,"
2546,7,the poor folk of the sea-country i blest
2547,7,"with daily boon of fish most delicate,"
2548,7,"they knew not whence this bounty, and elate"
2549,7,"would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach,"
2550,7,
2551,7, why was i not contented? wherefore reach
2552,7,"at things which, but for thee, o latmian!"
2553,7,had been my dreary death? fool! i began
2554,7,"to feel distemper'd longings, to desire"
2555,7,the utmost privilege that ocean's sire
2556,7,"could grant in benediction, to be free"
2557,7,"of all his kingdom, long in misery"
2558,7,"i wasted, ere in one extremest fit"
2559,7,"i plung'd for life or death, to interknit"
2560,7,one's senses with so dense a breathing stuff
2561,7,might seem a work of pain; so not enough
2562,7,"can i admire how crystal-smooth it felt,"
2563,7,"and buoyant round my limbs, at first i dwelt"
2564,7,whole days and days in sheer astonishment;
2565,7,forgetful utterly of self-intent;
2566,7,"moving but with the mighty ebb and flow,"
2567,7,"then, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew"
2568,7,"his spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,"
2569,7,"i tried in fear the pinions of my will,"
2570,7,'twas freedom! and at once i visited
2571,7,"the ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed,"
2572,7,"no need to tell thee of them, for i see"
2573,7,that thou hast been a witness--it must be
2574,7,"for these i know thou canst not feel a drouth,"
2575,7,"by the melancholy corners of that mouth,"
2576,7,so i will in my story straightway pass
2577,7,"to more immediate matter, woe, alas!"
2578,7,"that love should be my bane! ah, scylla fair!"
2579,7,why did poor glaucus ever--ever dare
2580,7,to sue thee to his heart? kind stranger-youth!
2581,7,"i lov'd her to the very white of truth,"
2582,7,"and she would not conceive it, timid thing!"
2583,7,"she fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,"
2584,7,"round every isle, and point, and promontory,"
2585,7,from where large hercules wound up his story
2586,7,"far as egyptian nile, my passion grew"
2587,7,"the more, the more i saw her dainty hue"
2588,7,"gleam delicately through the azure clear,"
2589,7,until 'twas too fierce agony to bear;
2590,7,"and in that agony, across my grief"
2591,7,"it flash'd, that circe might find some relief--"
2592,7,cruel enchantress! so above the water
2593,7,"i rear'd my head, and look'd for phoebus' daughter,"
2594,7,"aeaea's isle was wondering at the moon,--"
2595,7,"it seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon"
2596,7,"left me dead-drifting to that fatal power,"
2597,7,
2598,7," when i awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;"
2599,7,"just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,"
2600,7,"stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees,"
2601,7,"how sweet, and sweeter! for i heard a lyre,"
2602,7,"and over it a sighing voice expire,"
2603,7,it ceased--i caught light footsteps; and anon
2604,7,the fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon
2605,7,"push'd through a screen of roses, starry jove!"
2606,7,"with tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove"
2607,7,a net whose thraldom was more bliss than all
2608,7,"the range of flower'd elysium, thus did fall"
2609,7,"the dew of her rich speech, ah! art awake?"
2610,7,"o let me hear thee speak, for cupid's sake!"
2611,7,"i am so oppress'd with joy! why, i have shed"
2612,7,"an urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;"
2613,7,"and now i find thee living, i will pour"
2614,7,"from these devoted eyes their silver store,"
2615,7,"until exhausted of the latest drop,"
2616,7,"so it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop"
2617,7,"here, that i too may live, but if beyond"
2618,7,"such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond"
2619,7,"of soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;"
2620,7,if thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;
2621,7,"if smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,"
2622,7,"hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,"
2623,7,"o let me pluck it for thee, thus she link'd"
2624,7,"her charming syllables, till indistinct"
2625,7,their music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;
2626,7,"and then she hover'd over me, and stole"
2627,7,"so near, that if no nearer it had been"
2628,7,"this furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen,"
2629,7,
2630,7, young man of latmos! thus particular
2631,7,"am i, that thou may'st plainly see how far"
2632,7,"this fierce temptation went, and thou may'st not"
2633,7,"exclaim, how then, was scylla quite forgot?"
2634,7,
2635,7, who could resist? who in this universe?
2636,7,she did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse
2637,7,"my fine existence in a golden clime,"
2638,7,"she took me like a child of suckling time,"
2639,7,"and cradled me in roses, thus condemn'd,"
2640,7,"the current of my former life was stemm'd,"
2641,7,and to this arbitrary queen of sense
2642,7,"i bow'd a tranced vassal, nor would thence"
2643,7,"have mov'd, even though amphion's harp had woo'd"
2644,7,"me back to scylla o'er the billows rude,"
2645,7,for as apollo each eve doth devise
2646,7,a new appareling for western skies;
2647,7,"so every eve, nay every spendthrift hour"
2648,7,"shed balmy consciousness within that bower,"
2649,7,and i was free of haunts umbrageous;
2650,7,could wander in the mazy forest-house
2651,7,"of squirrels, foxes shy, and antler'd deer,"
2652,7,and birds from coverts innermost and drear
2653,7,warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow--
2654,7,to me new born delights!
2655,7,
2656,7,"                         now let me borrow,"
2657,7,"for moments few, a temperament as stern"
2658,7,"as pluto's sceptre, that my words not burn"
2659,7,"these uttering lips, while i in calm speech tell"
2660,7,"how specious heaven was changed to real hell,"
2661,7,
2662,7," one morn she left me sleeping, half awake"
2663,7,"i sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake"
2664,7,my greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;
2665,7,"but she was gone, whereat the barbed shafts"
2666,7,"of disappointment stuck in me so sore,"
2667,7,"that out i ran and search'd the forest o'er,"
2668,7,wandering about in pine and cedar gloom
2669,7,damp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom
2670,7,"a sound of moan, an agony of sound,"
2671,7,"sepulchral from the distance all around,"
2672,7,"then came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled"
2673,7,"that fierce complain to silence, while i stumbled"
2674,7,"down a precipitous path, as if impell'd,"
2675,7,"i came to a dark valley,--groanings swell'd"
2676,7,"poisonous about my ears, and louder grew,"
2677,7,"the nearer i approach'd a flame's gaunt blue,"
2678,7,"that glar'd before me through a thorny brake,"
2679,7,"this fire, like the eye of gordian snake,"
2680,7,bewitch'd me towards; and i soon was near
2681,7,"a sight too fearful for the feel of fear,"
2682,7,in thicket hid i curs'd the haggard scene--
2683,7,"the banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,"
2684,7,seated upon an uptorn forest root;
2685,7,"and all around her shapes, wizard and brute,"
2686,7,"laughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,"
2687,7,"shewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!"
2688,7,"o such deformities! old charon's self,"
2689,7,"should he give up awhile his penny pelf,"
2690,7,"and take a dream 'mong rushes stygian,"
2691,7,"it could not be so phantasied, fierce, wan,"
2692,7,"and tyrannizing was the lady's look,"
2693,7,"as over them a gnarled staff she shook,"
2694,7,"oft-times upon the sudden she laugh'd out,"
2695,7,and from a basket emptied to the rout
2696,7,"clusters of grapes, the which they raven'd quick"
2697,7,and roar'd for more; with many a hungry lick
2698,7,"about their shaggy jaws, avenging, slow,"
2699,7,"anon she took a branch of mistletoe,"
2700,7,"and emptied on't a black dull-gurgling phial,"
2701,7,"groan'd one and all, as if some piercing trial"
2702,7,"was sharpening for their pitiable bones,"
2703,7,"she lifted up the charm, appealing groans"
2704,7,from their poor breasts went sueing to her ear
2705,7,in vain; remorseless as an infant's bier
2706,7,"she whisk'd against their eyes the sooty oil,"
2707,7,"whereat was heard a noise of painful toil,"
2708,7,"increasing gradual to a tempest rage,"
2709,7,"shrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;"
2710,7,until their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat
2711,7,"and puff from the tail's end to stifled throat,"
2712,7,"then was appalling silence, then a sight"
2713,7,more wildering than all that hoarse affright;
2714,7,"for the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,"
2715,7,went through the dismal air like one huge python
2716,7,"antagonizing boreas,--and so vanish'd,"
2717,7,"yet there was not a breath of wind, she banish'd"
2718,7,"these phantoms with a nod, lo! from the dark"
2719,7,"came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,"
2720,7,"with dancing and loud revelry,--and went"
2721,7,"swifter than centaurs after rapine bent,--"
2722,7,sighing an elephant appear'd and bow'd
2723,7,"before the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud"
2724,7,"in human accent, potent goddess! chief"
2725,7,"of pains resistless! make my being brief,"
2726,7,"or let me from this heavy prison fly,"
2727,7,"or give me to the air, or let me die!"
2728,7,i sue not for my happy crown again;
2729,7,i sue not for my phalanx on the plain;
2730,7,"i sue not for my lone, my widow'd wife;"
2731,7,"i sue not for my ruddy drops of life,"
2732,7,"my children fair, my lovely girls and boys!"
2733,7,i will forget them; i will pass these joys;
2734,7,"ask nought so heavenward, so too--too high,"
2735,7,"only i pray, as fairest boon, to die,"
2736,7,"or be deliver'd from this cumbrous flesh,"
2737,7,"from this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,"
2738,7,"and merely given to the cold bleak air,"
2739,7,"have mercy, goddess! circe, feel my prayer!"
2740,7,
2741,7, that curst magician's name fell icy numb
2742,7,"upon my wild conjecturing, truth had come"
2743,7,"naked and sabre-like against my heart,"
2744,7,i saw a fury whetting a death-dart;
2745,7,"and my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,"
2746,7,"fainted away in that dark lair of night,"
2747,7,"think, my deliverer, how desolate"
2748,7,"my waking must have been! disgust, and hate,"
2749,7,and terrors manifold divided me
2750,7,"a spoil amongst them, i prepar'd to flee"
2751,7,"into the dungeon core of that wild wood,"
2752,7,i fled three days--when lo! before me stood
2753,7,"glaring the angry witch, o dis, even now,"
2754,7,"a clammy dew is beading on my brow,"
2755,7,"at mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse,"
2756,7,ha! ha! sir dainty! there must be a nurse
2757,7,"made of rose leaves and thistledown, express,"
2758,7,"to cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee, yes,"
2759,7,"i am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch,"
2760,7,"my tenderest squeeze is but a giant's clutch,"
2761,7,"so, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies"
2762,7,unheard of yet; and it shall still its cries
2763,7,"upon some breast more lily-feminine,"
2764,7,"oh, no--it shall not pine, and pine, and pine"
2765,7,"more than one pretty, trifling thousand years;"
2766,7,"and then 'twere pity, but fate's gentle shears"
2767,7,"cut short its immortality, sea-flirt!"
2768,7,young dove of the waters! truly i'll not hurt
2769,7,"one hair of thine, see how i weep and sigh,"
2770,7,"that our heart-broken parting is so nigh,"
2771,7,"and must we part? ah, yes, it must be so,"
2772,7,"yet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,"
2773,7,"let me sob over thee my last adieus,"
2774,7,"and speak a blessing, mark me! thou hast thews"
2775,7,"immortal, for thou art of heavenly race,"
2776,7,"but such a love is mine, that here i chase"
2777,7,eternally away from thee all bloom
2778,7,"of youth, and destine thee towards a tomb,"
2779,7,hence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;
2780,7,"and there, ere many days be overpast,"
2781,7,disabled age shall seize thee; and even then
2782,7,thou shalt not go the way of aged men;
2783,7,"but live and wither, cripple and still breathe"
2784,7,"ten hundred years, which gone, i then bequeath"
2785,7,"thy fragile bones to unknown burial,"
2786,7,"adieu, sweet love, adieu!--as shot stars fall,"
2787,7,"she fled ere i could groan for mercy, stung"
2788,7,"and poisoned was my spirit, despair sung"
2789,7,"a war-song of defiance 'gainst all hell,"
2790,7,a hand was at my shoulder to compel
2791,7,my sullen steps; another 'fore my eyes
2792,7,"moved on with pointed finger, in this guise"
2793,7,"enforced, at the last by ocean's foam"
2794,7,"i found me; by my fresh, my native home,"
2795,7,"its tempering coolness, to my life akin,"
2796,7,came salutary as i waded in;
2797,7,"and, with a blind voluptuous rage, i gave"
2798,7,"battle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave"
2799,7,"large froth before me, while there yet remain'd"
2800,7,"hale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain'd,"
2801,7,
2802,7," young lover, i must weep--such hellish spite"
2803,7,with dry cheek who can tell? while thus my might
2804,7,"proving upon this element, dismay'd,"
2805,7,upon a dead thing's face my hand i laid;
2806,7,"i look'd--'twas scylla! cursed, cursed circe!"
2807,7,"o vulture-witch, hast never heard of mercy?"
2808,7,"could not thy harshest vengeance be content,"
2809,7,but thou must nip this tender innocent
2810,7,"because i lov'd her?--cold, o cold indeed"
2811,7,"were her fair limbs, and like a common weed"
2812,7,"the sea-swell took her hair, dead as she was"
2813,7,"i clung about her waist, nor ceas'd to pass"
2814,7,"fleet as an arrow through unfathom'd brine,"
2815,7,"until there shone a fabric crystalline,"
2816,7,"ribb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl,"
2817,7,headlong i darted; at one eager swirl
2818,7,"gain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!"
2819,7,"'twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;"
2820,7,and all around--but wherefore this to thee
2821,7,who in few minutes more thyself shalt see?--
2822,7,"i left poor scylla in a niche and fled,"
2823,7,"my fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread"
2824,7,"met palsy half way, soon these limbs became"
2825,7,"gaunt, wither'd, sapless, feeble, cramp'd, and lame,"
2826,7,
2827,7," now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,"
2828,7,"without one hope, without one faintest trace"
2829,7,"of mitigation, or redeeming bubble"
2830,7,of colour'd phantasy; for i fear 'twould trouble
2831,7,"thy brain to loss of reason, and next tell"
2832,7,how a restoring chance came down to quell
2833,7,"one half of the witch in me,                 on a day,"
2834,7,"sitting upon a rock above the spray,"
2835,7,i saw grow up from the horizon's brink
2836,7,"a gallant vessel, soon she seem'd to sink"
2837,7,"away from me again, as though her course"
2838,7,had been resum'd in spite of hindering force--
2839,7,"so vanish'd, and not long, before arose"
2840,7,"dark clouds, and muttering of winds morose,"
2841,7,"old eolus would stifle his mad spleen,"
2842,7,"but could not, therefore all the billows green"
2843,7,"toss'd up the silver spume against the clouds,"
2844,7,"the tempest came, i saw that vessel's shrouds"
2845,7,in perilous bustle; while upon the deck
2846,7,"stood trembling creatures, i beheld the wreck;"
2847,7,"the final gulphing; the poor struggling souls,"
2848,7,"i heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls,"
2849,7,o they had all been sav'd but crazed eld
2850,7,"annull'd my vigorous cravings, and thus quell'd"
2851,7,"and curb'd, think on't, o latmian! did i sit"
2852,7,"writhing with pity, and a cursing fit"
2853,7,"against that hell-born circe, the crew had gone,"
2854,7,"by one and one, to pale oblivion;"
2855,7,"and i was gazing on the surges prone,"
2856,7,"with many a scalding tear and many a groan,"
2857,7,"when at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,"
2858,7,"grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand,"
2859,7,i knelt with pain--reached out my hand--had grasp'd
2860,7,these treasures--touch'd the knuckles--they unclasp'd--
2861,7,"i caught a finger, but the downward weight"
2862,7,"o'erpowered me--it sank, then 'gan abate"
2863,7,"the storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst"
2864,7,"the comfortable sun, i was athirst"
2865,7,"to search the book, and in the warming air"
2866,7,"parted its dripping leaves with eager care,"
2867,7,"strange matters did it treat of, and drew on"
2868,7,"my soul page after page, till well-nigh won"
2869,7,"into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,"
2870,7,"i read these words, and read again, and tried"
2871,7,"my eyes against the heavens, and read again,"
2872,7,o what a load of misery and pain
2873,7,each atlas-line bore off!--a shine of hope
2874,7,"came gold around me, cheering me to cope"
2875,7,"strenuous with hellish tyranny, attend!"
2876,7,"for thou hast brought their promise to an end,"
2877,7,
2878,7," in the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,"
2879,7,doom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch
2880,7,"his loath'd existence through ten centuries,"
2881,7,"and then to die alone, who can devise"
2882,7,"a total opposition? no one, so"
2883,7,"one million times ocean must ebb and flow,"
2884,7,"and he oppressed, yet he shall not die,"
2885,7,"these things accomplish'd,--if he utterly"
2886,7,"scans all the depths of magic, and expounds"
2887,7,"the meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;"
2888,7,if he explores all forms and substances
2889,7,straight homeward to their symbol-essences;
2890,7,"he shall not die, moreover, and in chief,"
2891,7,he must pursue this task of joy and grief
2892,7,"most piously;--all lovers tempest-tost,"
2893,7,"and in the savage overwhelming lost,"
2894,7,"he shall deposit side by side, until"
2895,7,"time's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil,"
2896,7,"which done, and all these labours ripened,"
2897,7,"a youth, by heavenly power lov'd and led,"
2898,7,shall stand before him; whom he shall direct
2899,7,"how to consummate all, the youth elect"
2900,7,"must do the thing, or both will be destroy'd,--"
2901,7,
2902,7," then, cried the young endymion, overjoy'd,"
2903,7,we are twin brothers in this destiny!
2904,7,"say, i intreat thee, what achievement high"
2905,7,"is, in this restless world, for me reserv'd,"
2906,7,"what! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv'd,"
2907,7,"had we both perish'd?--look! the sage replied,"
2908,7,"dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,"
2909,7,of divers brilliances? 'tis the edifice
2910,7,"i told thee of, where lovely scylla lies;"
2911,7,and where i have enshrined piously
2912,7,"all lovers, whom fell storms have doom'd to die"
2913,7,"throughout my bondage, thus discoursing, on"
2914,7,they went till unobscur'd the porches shone;
2915,7,"which hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight,"
2916,7,sure never since king neptune held his state
2917,7,"was seen such wonder underneath the stars,"
2918,7,turn to some level plain where haughty mars
2919,7,has legion'd all his battle; and behold
2920,7,"how every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold"
2921,7,"his even breast, see, many steeled squares,"
2922,7,and rigid ranks of iron--whence who dares
2923,7,"one step? imagine further, line by line,"
2924,7,"these warrior thousands on the field supine,--"
2925,7,"so in that crystal place, in silent rows,"
2926,7,"poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes,--"
2927,7,"the stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd"
2928,7,such thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;
2929,7,"such ranges of white feet, and patient lips"
2930,7,"all ruddy,--for here death no blossom nips,"
2931,7,he mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair
2932,7,put sleekly on one side with nicest care;
2933,7,"and each one's gentle wrists, with reverence,"
2934,7,"put cross-wise to its heart,"
2935,7,
2936,7,"                             let us commence,"
2937,7,"whisper'd the guide, stuttering with joy, even now,"
2938,7,"he spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,"
2939,7,"began to tear his scroll in pieces small,"
2940,7,"uttering the while some mumblings funeral,"
2941,7,he tore it into pieces small as snow
2942,7,that drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;
2943,7,"and having done it, took his dark blue cloak"
2944,7,"and bound it round endymion, then struck"
2945,7,"his wand against the empty air times nine,--"
2946,7,"what more there is to do, young man, is thine,"
2947,7,but first a little patience; first undo
2948,7,"this tangled thread, and wind it to a clue,"
2949,7,"ah, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;"
2950,7,"and shouldst thou break it--what, is it done so clean?"
2951,7,"a power overshadows thee! oh, brave!"
2952,7,"the spite of hell is tumbling to its grave,"
2953,7,"here is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,"
2954,7,nor mark'd with any sign or charactery--
2955,7,canst thou read aught? o read for pity's sake!
2956,7,"olympus! we are safe! now, carian, break"
2957,7,"this wand against yon lyre on the pedestal,"
2958,7,
2959,7," 'twas done, and straight with sudden swell and fall"
2960,7,"sweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd"
2961,7,"a lullaby to silence,--youth! now strew"
2962,7,"these minced leaves on me, and passing through"
2963,7,"those files of dead, scatter the same around,"
2964,7,"and thou wilt see the issue,--'mid the sound"
2965,7,"of flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,"
2966,7,"endymion from glaucus stood apart,"
2967,7,"and scatter'd in his face some fragments light,"
2968,7,how lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight
2969,7,"smiling beneath a coral diadem,"
2970,7,"out-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,"
2971,7,"appear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,"
2972,7,"kneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force"
2973,7,"press'd its cold hand, and wept--and scylla sigh'd!"
2974,7,"endymion, with quick hand, the charm applied--"
2975,7,"the nymph arose, he left them to their joy,"
2976,7,"and onward went upon his high employ,"
2977,7,"showering those powerful fragments on the dead,"
2978,7,"and, as he pass'd, each lifted up its head,"
2979,7,"as doth a flower at apollo's touch,"
2980,7,"death felt it to his inwards; 'twas too much,"
2981,7,"death fell a weeping in his charnel-house,"
2982,7,"the latmian persever'd along, and thus"
2983,7,"all were re-animated, there arose"
2984,7,"a noise of harmony, pulses and throes"
2985,7,"of gladness in the air--while many, who"
2986,7,"had died in mutual arms devout and true,"
2987,7,sprang to each other madly; and the rest
2988,7,"felt a high certainty of being blest,"
2989,7,"they gaz'd upon endymion, enchantment"
2990,7,"grew drunken, and would have its head and bent,"
2991,7,"delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,"
2992,7,"budded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers"
2993,7,"of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine,"
2994,7,the two deliverers tasted a pure wine
2995,7,"of happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out,"
2996,7,"speechless they eyed each other, and about"
2997,7,"the fair assembly wander'd to and fro,"
2998,7,distracted with the richest overflow
2999,7,"of joy that ever pour'd from heaven,"
3000,7,
3001,7,                                   ----away!
3002,7,"shouted the new-born god; follow, and pay"
3003,7,our piety to neptunus supreme!--
3004,7,"then scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,"
3005,7,"they led on first, bent to her meek surprise,"
3006,7,"through portal columns of a giant size,"
3007,7,"into the vaulted, boundless emerald,"
3008,7,"joyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,"
3009,7,down marble steps; pouring as easily
3010,7,"as hour-glass sand--and fast, as you might see"
3011,7,"swallows obeying the south summer's call,"
3012,7,"or swans upon a gentle waterfall,"
3013,7,
3014,7," thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,"
3015,7,"ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,"
3016,7,"just within ken, they saw descending thick"
3017,7,"another multitude, whereat more quick"
3018,7,"moved either host, on a wide sand they met,"
3019,7,and of those numbers every eye was wet;
3020,7,"for each their old love found, a murmuring rose,"
3021,7,like what was never heard in all the throes
3022,7,"of wind and waters, 'tis past human wit"
3023,7,"to tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it,"
3024,7,
3025,7," this mighty consummation made, the host"
3026,7,"mov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost"
3027,7,"huge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,"
3028,7,"and from the rear diminishing away,--"
3029,7,"till a faint dawn surpris'd them, glaucus cried,"
3030,7,"behold! behold, the palace of his pride!"
3031,7,"god neptune's palaces! with noise increas'd,"
3032,7,"they shoulder'd on towards that brightening east,"
3033,7,at every onward step proud domes arose
3034,7,"in prospect,--diamond gleams, and golden glows"
3035,7,"of amber 'gainst their faces levelling,"
3036,7,"joyous, and many as the leaves in spring,"
3037,7,"still onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd,"
3038,7,"rich opal domes were seen, on high upheld"
3039,7,"by jasper pillars, letting through their shafts"
3040,7,"a blush of coral, copious wonder-draughts"
3041,7,"each gazer drank; and deeper drank more near,"
3042,7,"for what poor mortals fragment up, as mere"
3043,7,"as marble was there lavish, to the vast"
3044,7,"of one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,"
3045,7,"even for common bulk, those olden three,"
3046,7,"memphis, and babylon, and nineveh,"
3047,7,
3048,7," as large, as bright, as colour'd as the bow"
3049,7,"of iris, when unfading it doth shew"
3050,7,"beyond a silvery shower, was the arch"
3051,7,"through which this paphian army took its march,"
3052,7,"into the outer courts of neptune's state,"
3053,7,"whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,"
3054,7,to which the leaders sped; but not half raught
3055,7,"ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,"
3056,7,and made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes
3057,7,"like callow eagles at the first sunrise,"
3058,7,soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze
3059,7,"ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,"
3060,7,"and then, behold! large neptune on his throne"
3061,7,"of emerald deep, yet not exalt alone;"
3062,7,"at his right hand stood winged love, and on"
3063,7,"his left sat smiling beauty's paragon,"
3064,7,
3065,7, far as the mariner on highest mast
3066,7,"can see all round upon the calmed vast,"
3067,7,"so wide was neptune's hall, and as the blue"
3068,7,"doth vault the waters, so the waters drew"
3069,7,"their doming curtains, high, magnificent,"
3070,7,aw'd from the throne aloof;--and when storm-rent
3071,7,disclos'd the thunder-gloomings in jove's air;
3072,7,"but sooth'd as now, flash'd sudden everywhere,"
3073,7,"noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering"
3074,7,"death to a human eye, for there did spring"
3075,7,"from natural west, and east, and south, and north,"
3076,7,"a light as of four sunsets, blazing forth"
3077,7,"a gold-green zenith 'bove the sea-god's head,"
3078,7,"of lucid depth the floor, and far outspread"
3079,7,"as breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe"
3080,7,"of feather'd indian darts about, as through"
3081,7,"the delicatest air, air verily,"
3082,7,"but for the portraiture of clouds and sky,"
3083,7,"this palace floor breath-air,--but for the amaze"
3084,7,"of deep-seen wonders motionless,--and blaze"
3085,7,"of the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,"
3086,7,"globing a golden sphere,"
3087,7,
3088,7,                         they stood in dreams
3089,7,"till triton blew his horn, the palace rang;"
3090,7,the nereids danc'd; the syrens faintly sang;
3091,7,"and the great sea-king bow'd his dripping head,"
3092,7,"then love took wing, and from his pinions shed"
3093,7,"on all the multitude a nectarous dew,"
3094,7,the ooze-born goddess beckoned and drew
3095,7,fair scylla and her guides to conference;
3096,7,and when they reach'd the throned eminence
3097,7,"she kist the sea-nymph's cheek,--who sat her down"
3098,7,"a toying with the doves, then,--mighty crown"
3099,7,"and sceptre of this kingdom! venus said,"
3100,7,"thy vows were on a time to nais paid,"
3101,7,behold!--two copious tear-drops instant fell
3102,7,"from the god's large eyes; he smil'd delectable,"
3103,7,"and over glaucus held his blessing hands,--"
3104,7,endymion! ah! still wandering in the bands
3105,7,"of love? now this is cruel, since the hour"
3106,7,"i met thee in earth's bosom, all my power"
3107,7,"have i put forth to serve thee, what, not yet"
3108,7,escap'd from dull mortality's harsh net?
3109,7,"a little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,"
3110,7,"or i am skilless quite, an idle tongue,"
3111,7,"a humid eye, and steps luxurious,"
3112,7,"where these are new and strange, are ominous,"
3113,7,"aye, i have seen these signs in one of heaven,"
3114,7,when others were all blind; and were i given
3115,7,"to utter secrets, haply i might say"
3116,7,"some pleasant words,--but love will have his day,"
3117,7,"so wait awhile expectant, pr'ythee soon,"
3118,7,"even in the passing of thine honey-moon,"
3119,7,"visit my cytherea, thou wilt find"
3120,7,"cupid well-natured, my adonis kind;"
3121,7,"and pray persuade with thee--ah, i have done,"
3122,7,"all blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!--"
3123,7,"thus the fair goddess, while endymion"
3124,7,"knelt to receive those accents halcyon,"
3125,7,
3126,7, meantime a glorious revelry began
3127,7,"before the water-monarch, nectar ran"
3128,7,in courteous fountains to all cups outreach'd;
3129,7,"and plunder'd vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach'd"
3130,7,new growth about each shell and pendent lyre;
3131,7,"the which, in disentangling for their fire,"
3132,7,pull'd down fresh foliage and coverture
3133,7,"for dainty toying, cupid, empire-sure,"
3134,7,"flutter'd and laugh'd, and oft-times through the throng"
3135,7,"made a delighted way, then dance, and song,"
3136,7,"and garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd,"
3137,7,"in harmless tendril they each other chain'd,"
3138,7,and strove who should be smother'd deepest in
3139,7,"fresh crush of leaves,"
3140,7,
3141,7,                         o 'tis a very sin
3142,7,for one so weak to venture his poor verse
3143,7,"in such a place as this, o do not curse,"
3144,7,"high muses! let him hurry to the ending,"
3145,7,
3146,7," all suddenly were silent, a soft blending"
3147,7,of dulcet instruments came charmingly;
3148,7,"and then a hymn,"
3149,7,
3150,7,                   king of the stormy sea!
3151,7,"brother of jove, and co-inheritor"
3152,7,of elements! eternally before
3153,7,"thee the waves awful bow, fast, stubborn rock,"
3154,7,"at thy fear'd trident shrinking, doth unlock"
3155,7,"its deep foundations, hissing into foam,"
3156,7,"all mountain-rivers lost, in the wide home"
3157,7,"of thy capacious bosom ever flow,"
3158,7,"thou frownest, and old eolus thy foe"
3159,7,"skulks to his cavern, 'mid the gruff complaint"
3160,7,"of all his rebel tempests, dark clouds faint"
3161,7,"when, from thy diadem, a silver gleam"
3162,7,"slants over blue dominion, thy bright team"
3163,7,"gulphs in the morning light, and scuds along"
3164,7,to bring thee nearer to that golden song
3165,7,"apollo singeth, while his chariot"
3166,7,"waits at the doors of heaven, thou art not"
3167,7,"for scenes like this, an empire stern hast thou;"
3168,7,"and it hath furrow'd that large front, yet now,"
3169,7,"as newly come of heaven, dost thou sit"
3170,7,to blend and interknit
3171,7,"subdued majesty with this glad time,"
3172,7,o shell-borne king sublime!
3173,7,we lay our hearts before thee evermore--
3174,7,"we sing, and we adore!"
3175,7,
3176,7," breathe softly, flutes;"
3177,7,"be tender of your strings, ye soothing lutes;"
3178,7,"nor be the trumpet heard! o vain, o vain;"
3179,7,"not flowers budding in an april rain,"
3180,7,"nor breath of sleeping dove, nor river's flow,--"
3181,7,"no, nor the eolian twang of love's own bow,"
3182,7,can mingle music fit for the soft ear
3183,7,of goddess cytherea!
3184,7,"yet deign, white queen of beauty, thy fair eyes"
3185,7,"on our souls' sacrifice,"
3186,7,
3187,7, bright-winged child!
3188,7,who has another care when thou hast smil'd?
3189,7,"unfortunates on earth, we see at last"
3190,7,"all death-shadows, and glooms that overcast"
3191,7,"our spirits, fann'd away by thy light pinions,"
3192,7,o sweetest essence! sweetest of all minions!
3193,7,"god of warm pulses, and dishevell'd hair,"
3194,7,and panting bosoms bare!
3195,7,dear unseen light in darkness! eclipser
3196,7,of light in light! delicious poisoner!
3197,7,thy venom'd goblet will we quaff until
3198,7,we fill--we fill!
3199,7,and by thy mother's lips----
3200,7,
3201,7,                        was heard no more
3202,7,"for clamour, when the golden palace door"
3203,7,"opened again, and from without, in shone"
3204,7,"a new magnificence, on oozy throne"
3205,7,"smooth-moving came oceanus the old,"
3206,7,"to take a latest glimpse at his sheep-fold,"
3207,7,before he went into his quiet cave
3208,7,"to muse for ever--then a lucid wave,"
3209,7,"scoop'd from its trembling sisters of mid-sea,"
3210,7,"afloat, and pillowing up the majesty"
3211,7,"of doris, and the egean seer, her spouse--"
3212,7,"next, on a dolphin, clad in laurel boughs,"
3213,7,"theban amphion leaning on his lute,"
3214,7,his fingers went across it--all were mute
3215,7,"to gaze on amphitrite, queen of pearls,"
3216,7,"and thetis pearly too,--"
3217,7,
3218,7,                          the palace whirls
3219,7,around giddy endymion; seeing he
3220,7,"was there far strayed from mortality,"
3221,7,he could not bear it--shut his eyes in vain;
3222,7,"imagination gave a dizzier pain,"
3223,7,"o i shall die! sweet venus, be my stay!"
3224,7,where is my lovely mistress? well-away!
3225,7,i die--i hear her voice--i feel my wing--
3226,7,"at neptune's feet he sank, a sudden ring"
3227,7,"of nereids were about him, in kind strife"
3228,7,"to usher back his spirit into life,"
3229,7,"but still he slept, at last they interwove"
3230,7,"their cradling arms, and purpos'd to convey"
3231,7,"towards a crystal bower far away,"
3232,7,
3233,7," lo! while slow carried through the pitying crowd,"
3234,7,to his inward senses these words spake aloud;
3235,7,"written in star-light on the dark above,"
3236,7,dearest endymion! my entire love!
3237,7,"how have i dwelt in fear of fate, 'tis done--"
3238,7,"immortal bliss for me too hast thou won,"
3239,7,arise then! for the hen-dove shall not hatch
3240,7,"her ready eggs, before i'll kissing snatch"
3241,7,"thee into endless heaven, awake! awake!"
3242,7,
3243,7," the youth at once arose, a placid lake"
3244,7,"came quiet to his eyes; and forest green,"
3245,7,"cooler than all the wonders he had seen,"
3246,7,"lull'd with its simple song his fluttering breast,"
3247,7,how happy once again in grassy nest!
3248,8,muse of my native land! loftiest muse!
3249,8,o first-born on the mountains! by the hues
3250,8,"of heaven on the spiritual air begot,"
3251,8,"long didst thou sit alone in northern grot,"
3252,8,while yet our england was a wolfish den;
3253,8,before our forests heard the talk of men;
3254,8,before the first of druids was a child;--
3255,8,long didst thou sit amid our regions wild
3256,8,"rapt in a deep prophetic solitude,"
3257,8,"there came an eastern voice of solemn mood,--"
3258,8,"yet wast thou patient, then sang forth the nine,"
3259,8,"apollo's garland,--yet didst thou divine"
3260,8,"such home-bred glory, that they cry'd in vain,"
3261,8,"come hither, sister of the island! plain"
3262,8,spake fair ausonia; and once more she spake
3263,8,"a higher summons,--still didst thou betake"
3264,8,"thee to thy native hopes, o thou hast won"
3265,8,"a full accomplishment! the thing is done,"
3266,8,"which undone, these our latter days had risen"
3267,8,"on barren souls, great muse, thou know'st what prison"
3268,8,"of flesh and bone, curbs, and confines, and frets"
3269,8,"our spirit's wings, despondency besets"
3270,8,our pillows; and the fresh to-morrow morn
3271,8,seems to give forth its light in very scorn
3272,8,"of our dull, uninspired, snail-paced lives,"
3273,8,"long have i said, how happy he who shrives"
3274,8,"to thee! but then i thought on poets gone,"
3275,8,"and could not pray,--nor can i now--so on"
3276,8,"i move to the end in lowliness of heart,----"
3277,8,
3278,8," ah, woe is me! that i should fondly part"
3279,8,"from my dear native land! ah, foolish maid!"
3280,8,"glad was the hour, when, with thee, myriads bade"
3281,8,adieu to ganges and their pleasant fields!
3282,8,to one so friendless the clear freshet yields
3283,8,"a bitter coolness, the ripe grape is sour,"
3284,8,"yet i would have, great gods! but one short hour"
3285,8,"of native air--let me but die at home,"
3286,8,
3287,8, endymion to heaven's airy dome
3288,8,"was offering up a hecatomb of vows,"
3289,8,"when these words reach'd him, whereupon he bows"
3290,8,his head through thorny-green entanglement
3291,8,"of underwood, and to the sound is bent,"
3292,8,"anxious as hind towards her hidden fawn,"
3293,8,
3294,8, is no one near to help me? no fair dawn
3295,8,of life from charitable voice? no sweet saying
3296,8,to set my dull and sadden'd spirit playing?
3297,8,no hand to toy with mine? no lips so sweet
3298,8,that i may worship them? no eyelids meet
3299,8,to twinkle on my bosom? no one dies
3300,8,"before me, till from these enslaving eyes"
3301,8,"redemption sparkles!--i am sad and lost,"
3302,8,
3303,8," thou, carian lord, hadst better have been tost"
3304,8,"into a whirlpool, vanish into air,"
3305,8,warm mountaineer! for canst thou only bear
3306,8,a woman's sigh alone and in distress?
3307,8,see not her charms! is phoebe passionless?
3308,8,"phoebe is fairer far--o gaze no more,--"
3309,8,"yet if thou wilt behold all beauty's store,"
3310,8,behold her panting in the forest grass!
3311,8,do not those curls of glossy jet surpass
3312,8,for tenderness the arms so idly lain
3313,8,"amongst them? feelest not a kindred pain,"
3314,8,to see such lovely eyes in swimming search
3315,8,"after some warm delight, that seems to perch"
3316,8,dovelike in the dim cell lying beyond
3317,8,their upper lids?--hist!             o for hermes' wand
3318,8,to touch this flower into human shape!
3319,8,that woodland hyacinthus could escape
3320,8,"from his green prison, and here kneeling down"
3321,8,"call me his queen, his second life's fair crown!"
3322,8,"ah me, how i could love!--my soul doth melt"
3323,8,for the unhappy youth--love! i have felt
3324,8,"so faint a kindness, such a meek surrender"
3325,8,"to what my own full thoughts had made too tender,"
3326,8,that but for tears my life had fled away!--
3327,8,"ye deaf and senseless minutes of the day,"
3328,8,"and thou, old forest, hold ye this for true,"
3329,8,"there is no lightning, no authentic dew"
3330,8,"but in the eye of love, there's not a sound,"
3331,8,"melodious howsoever, can confound"
3332,8,the heavens and earth in one to such a death
3333,8,"as doth the voice of love, there's not a breath"
3334,8,"will mingle kindly with the meadow air,"
3335,8,"till it has panted round, and stolen a share"
3336,8,of passion from the heart!--
3337,8,
3338,8,                             upon a bough
3339,8,"he leant, wretched, he surely cannot now"
3340,8,"thirst for another love, o impious,"
3341,8,that he can even dream upon it thus!--
3342,8,"thought he, why am i not as are the dead,"
3343,8,since to a woe like this i have been led
3344,8,"through the dark earth, and through the wondrous sea?"
3345,8,"goddess! i love thee not the less, from thee"
3346,8,"by juno's smile i turn not--no, no, no--"
3347,8,"while the great waters are at ebb and flow,--"
3348,8,i have a triple soul! o fond pretence--
3349,8,"for both, for both my love is so immense,"
3350,8,"i feel my heart is cut in twain for them,"
3351,8,
3352,8," and so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain,"
3353,8,"the lady's heart beat quick, and he could see"
3354,8,"her gentle bosom heave tumultuously,"
3355,8,"he sprang from his green covert, there she lay,"
3356,8,sweet as a muskrose upon new-made hay;
3357,8,"with all her limbs on tremble, and her eyes"
3358,8,"shut softly up alive, to speak he tries,"
3359,8,"fair damsel, pity me! forgive that i"
3360,8,thus violate thy bower's sanctity!
3361,8,"o pardon me, for i am full of grief--"
3362,8,"grief born of thee, young angel! fairest thief!"
3363,8,who stolen hast away the wings wherewith
3364,8,"i was to top the heavens, dear maid, sith"
3365,8,"thou art my executioner, and i feel"
3366,8,"loving and hatred, misery and weal,"
3367,8,"will in a few short hours be nothing to me,"
3368,8,and all my story that much passion slew me;
3369,8,"do smile upon the evening of my days,"
3370,8,"and, for my tortur'd brain begins to craze,"
3371,8,be thou my nurse; and let me understand
3372,8,"how dying i shall kiss that lily hand,--"
3373,8,"dost weep for me? then should i be content,"
3374,8,"scowl on, ye fates! until the firmament"
3375,8,"outblackens erebus, and the full-cavern'd earth"
3376,8,"crumbles into itself, by the cloud girth"
3377,8,"of jove, those tears have given me a thirst"
3378,8,"to meet oblivion,--as her heart would burst"
3379,8,"the maiden sobb'd awhile, and then replied,"
3380,8,why must such desolation betide
3381,8,as that thou speakest of? are not these green nooks
3382,8,empty of all misfortune? do the brooks
3383,8,"utter a gorgon voice? does yonder thrush,"
3384,8,schooling its half-fledg'd little ones to brush
3385,8,"about the dewy forest, whisper tales?--"
3386,8,"speak not of grief, young stranger, or cold snails"
3387,8,"will slime the rose to night, though if thou wilt,"
3388,8,methinks 'twould be a guilt--a very guilt--
3389,8,"not to companion thee, and sigh away"
3390,8,the light--the dusk--the dark--till break of day!
3391,8,"dear lady, said endymion, 'tis past,"
3392,8,"i love thee! and my days can never last,"
3393,8,"that i may pass in patience still speak,"
3394,8,"let me have music dying, and i seek"
3395,8,"no more delight--i bid adieu to all,"
3396,8,"didst thou not after other climates call,"
3397,8,"and murmur about indian streams?--then she,"
3398,8,"sitting beneath the midmost forest tree,"
3399,8,for pity sang this roundelay------
3400,8,
3401,8,"         o sorrow,"
3402,8,         why dost borrow
3403,8,"the natural hue of health, from vermeil lips?--"
3404,8,         to give maiden blushes
3405,8,         to the white rose bushes?
3406,8,or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips?
3407,8,
3408,8,"         o sorrow,"
3409,8,         why dost borrow
3410,8,the lustrous passion from a falcon-eye?--
3411,8,         to give the glow-worm light?
3412,8,"         or, on a moonless night,"
3413,8,"to tinge, on syren shores, the salt sea-spry?"
3414,8,
3415,8,"         o sorrow,"
3416,8,         why dost borrow
3417,8,the mellow ditties from a mourning tongue?--
3418,8,         to give at evening pale
3419,8,"         unto the nightingale,"
3420,8,that thou mayst listen the cold dews among?
3421,8,
3422,8,"         o sorrow,"
3423,8,         why dost borrow
3424,8,heart's lightness from the merriment of may?--
3425,8,         a lover would not tread
3426,8,"         a cowslip on the head,"
3427,8,though he should dance from eve till peep of day--
3428,8,         nor any drooping flower
3429,8,"         held sacred for thy bower,"
3430,8,"wherever he may sport himself and play,"
3431,8,
3432,8,         to sorrow
3433,8,"         i bade good-morrow,"
3434,8,and thought to leave her far away behind;
3435,8,"         but cheerly, cheerly,"
3436,8,         she loves me dearly;
3437,8,"she is so constant to me, and so kind,"
3438,8,         i would deceive her
3439,8,"         and so leave her,"
3440,8,"but ah! she is so constant and so kind,"
3441,8,
3442,8,"beneath my palm trees, by the river side,"
3443,8,"i sat a weeping, in the whole world wide"
3444,8,"there was no one to ask me why i wept,--"
3445,8,         and so i kept
3446,8,brimming the water-lily cups with tears
3447,8,"         cold as my fears,"
3448,8,
3449,8,"beneath my palm trees, by the river side,"
3450,8,"i sat a weeping, what enamour'd bride,"
3451,8,"cheated by shadowy wooer from the clouds,"
3452,8,       but hides and shrouds
3453,8,beneath dark palm trees by a river side?
3454,8,
3455,8,"and as i sat, over the light blue hills"
3456,8,"there came a noise of revellers, the rills"
3457,8,into the wide stream came of purple hue--
3458,8,       'twas bacchus and his crew!
3459,8,"the earnest trumpet spake, and silver thrills"
3460,8,from kissing cymbals made a merry din--
3461,8,       'twas bacchus and his kin!
3462,8,"like to a moving vintage down they came,"
3463,8,"crown'd with green leaves, and faces all on flame;"
3464,8,"all madly dancing through the pleasant valley,"
3465,8,"       to scare thee, melancholy!"
3466,8,"o then, o then, thou wast a simple name!"
3467,8,"and i forgot thee, as the berried holly"
3468,8,"by shepherds is forgotten, when, in june,"
3469,8,"tall chesnuts keep away the sun and moon,--"
3470,8,       i rush'd into the folly!
3471,8,
3472,8,"within his car, aloft, young bacchus stood,"
3473,8,"trifling his ivy-dart, in dancing mood,"
3474,8,       with sidelong laughing;
3475,8,and little rills of crimson wine imbrued
3476,8,"his plump white arms, and shoulders, enough white"
3477,8,       for venus' pearly bite;
3478,8,"and near him rode silenus on his ass,"
3479,8,pelted with flowers as he on did pass
3480,8,"       tipsily quaffing,"
3481,8,
3482,8,"whence came ye, merry damsels! whence came ye!"
3483,8,"so many, and so many, and such glee?"
3484,8,"why have ye left your bowers desolate,"
3485,8,"       your lutes, and gentler fate?--"
3486,8,‘we follow bacchus! bacchus on the wing?
3487,8,       a conquering!
3488,8,"bacchus, young bacchus! good or ill betide,"
3489,8,"we dance before him thorough kingdoms wide,--"
3490,8,"come hither, lady fair, and joined be"
3491,8,       to our wild minstrelsy!'
3492,8,
3493,8,"whence came ye, jolly satyrs! whence came ye!"
3494,8,"so many, and so many, and such glee?"
3495,8,"why have ye left your forest haunts, why left"
3496,8,       your nuts in oak-tree cleft?--
3497,8,"‘for wine, for wine we left our kernel tree;"
3498,8,"for wine we left our heath, and yellow brooms,"
3499,8,       and cold mushrooms;
3500,8,for wine we follow bacchus through the earth;
3501,8,great god of breathless cups and chirping mirth!--
3502,8,"come hither, lady fair, and joined be"
3503,8,to our mad minstrelsy!'
3504,8,
3505,8,"over wide streams and mountains great we went,"
3506,8,"and, save when bacchus kept his ivy tent,"
3507,8,"onward the tiger and the leopard pants,"
3508,8,"       with asian elephants,"
3509,8,"onward these myriads--with song and dance,"
3510,8,"with zebras striped, and sleek arabians' prance,"
3511,8,"web-footed alligators, crocodiles,"
3512,8,"bearing upon their scaly backs, in files,"
3513,8,plump infant laughers mimicking the coil
3514,8,"of seamen, and stout galley-rowers' toil,"
3515,8,"with toying oars and silken sails they glide,"
3516,8,"       nor care for wind and tide,"
3517,8,
3518,8,"mounted on panthers' furs and lions' manes,"
3519,8,from rear to van they scour about the plains;
3520,8,"a three days' journey in a moment done,"
3521,8,"and always, at the rising of the sun,"
3522,8,"about the wilds they hunt with spear and horn,"
3523,8,"       on spleenful unicorn,"
3524,8,
3525,8,i saw osirian egypt kneel adown
3526,8,       before the vine-wreath crown!
3527,8,i saw parch'd abyssinia rouse and sing
3528,8,       to the silver cymbals' ring!
3529,8,i saw the whelming vintage hotly pierce
3530,8,       old tartary the fierce!
3531,8,"the kings of inde their jewel-sceptres vail,"
3532,8,and from their treasures scatter pearled hail;
3533,8,"great brahma from his mystic heaven groans,"
3534,8,       and all his priesthood moans;
3535,8,"before young bacchus' eye-wink turning pale,--"
3536,8,"into these regions came i following him,"
3537,8,"sick hearted, weary--so i took a whim"
3538,8,to stray away into these forests drear
3539,8,"       alone, without a peer,"
3540,8,"and i have told thee all thou mayest hear,"
3541,8,
3542,8,         young stranger!
3543,8,         i've been a ranger
3544,8,"in search of pleasure throughout every clime,"
3545,8,         alas! 'tis not for me!
3546,8,"         bewitch'd i sure must be,"
3547,8,"to lose in grieving all my maiden prime,"
3548,8,
3549,8,"         come then, sorrow!"
3550,8,         sweetest sorrow!
3551,8,"like an own babe i nurse thee on my breast,"
3552,8,         i thought to leave thee
3553,8,"         and deceive thee,"
3554,8,"but now of all the world i love thee best,"
3555,8,
3556,8,"         there is not one,"
3557,8,"         no, no, not one"
3558,8,but thee to comfort a poor lonely maid;
3559,8,"         thou art her mother,"
3560,8,"         and her brother,"
3561,8,"her playmate, and her wooer in the shade,"
3562,8,
3563,8," o what a sigh she gave in finishing,"
3564,8,"and look, quite dead to every worldly thing!"
3565,8,"endymion could not speak, but gazed on her;"
3566,8,and listened to the wind that now did stir
3567,8,"about the crisped oaks full drearily,"
3568,8,yet with as sweet a softness as might be
3569,8,"remember'd from its velvet summer song,"
3570,8,"at last he said, poor lady, how thus long"
3571,8,have i been able to endure that voice?
3572,8,fair melody! kind syren! i've no choice;
3573,8,"i must be thy sad servant evermore,"
3574,8,"i cannot choose but kneel here and adore,"
3575,8,"alas, i must not think--by phoebe, no!"
3576,8,"let me not think, soft angel! shall it be so?"
3577,8,"say, beautifullest, shall i never think?"
3578,8,o thou could'st foster me beyond the brink
3579,8,of recollection! make my watchful care
3580,8,"close up its bloodshot eyes, nor see despair!"
3581,8,"do gently murder half my soul, and i"
3582,8,shall feel the other half so utterly!--
3583,8,i'm giddy at that cheek so fair and smooth;
3584,8,o let it blush so ever! let it soothe
3585,8,my madness! let it mantle rosy-warm
3586,8,"with the tinge of love, panting in safe alarm,--"
3587,8,"this cannot be thy hand, and yet it is;"
3588,8,and this is sure thine other softling--this
3589,8,"thine own fair bosom, and i am so near!"
3590,8,wilt fall asleep? o let me sip that tear!
3591,8,and whisper one sweet word that i may know
3592,8,this is this world--sweet dewy blossom!--woe!
3593,8,woe! woe to that endymion! where is he?--
3594,8,even these words went echoing dismally
3595,8,"through the wide forest--a most fearful tone,"
3596,8,like one repenting in his latest moan;
3597,8,"and while it died away a shade pass'd by,"
3598,8,"as of a thunder cloud, when arrows fly"
3599,8,"through the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth"
3600,8,their timid necks and tremble; so these both
3601,8,"leant to each other trembling, and sat so"
3602,8,"waiting for some destruction--when lo,"
3603,8,foot-feather'd mercury appear'd sublime
3604,8,beyond the tall tree tops; and in less time
3605,8,"than shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt"
3606,8,"towards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt"
3607,8,"one moment from his home, only the sward"
3608,8,"he with his wand light touch'd, and heavenward"
3609,8,swifter than sight was gone--even before
3610,8,the teeming earth a sudden witness bore
3611,8,"of his swift magic, diving swans appear"
3612,8,above the crystal circlings white and clear;
3613,8,"and catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,"
3614,8,how they can dive in sight and unseen rise--
3615,8,"so from the turf outsprang two steeds jet-black,"
3616,8,"each with large dark blue wings upon his back,"
3617,8,the youth of caria plac'd the lovely dame
3618,8,"on one, and felt himself in spleen to tame"
3619,8,"the other's fierceness, through the air they flew,"
3620,8,"high as the eagles, like two drops of dew"
3621,8,"exhal'd to phoebus' lips, away they are gone,"
3622,8,"far from the earth away--unseen, alone,"
3623,8,"among cool clouds and winds, but that the free,"
3624,8,the buoyant life of song can floating be
3625,8,"above their heads, and follow them untir'd,--"
3626,8,"muse of my native land, am i inspir'd?"
3627,8,"this is the giddy air, and i must spread"
3628,8,wide pinions to keep here; nor do i dread
3629,8,"or height, or depth, or width, or any chance"
3630,8,"precipitous, i have beneath my glance"
3631,8,"those towering horses and their mournful freight,"
3632,8,"could i thus sail, and see, and thus await"
3633,8,"fearless for power of thought, without thine aid?--"
3634,8,"there is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade"
3635,8,"from some approaching wonder, and behold"
3636,8,"those winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold"
3637,8,"snuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,"
3638,8,dying to embers from their native fire!
3639,8,
3640,8," there curl'd a purple mist around them; soon,"
3641,8,it seem'd as when around the pale new moon
3642,8,"sad zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow,"
3643,8,"'twas sleep slow journeying with head on pillow,"
3644,8,"for the first time, since he came nigh dead born"
3645,8,"from the old womb of night, his cave forlorn"
3646,8,"had he left more forlorn; for the first time,"
3647,8,he felt aloof the day and morning's prime--
3648,8,because into his depth cimmerian
3649,8,"there came a dream, shewing how a young man,"
3650,8,"ere a lean bat could plump its wintery skin,"
3651,8,would at high jove's empyreal footstool win
3652,8,"an immortality, and how espouse"
3653,8,"jove's daughter, and be reckon'd of his house,"
3654,8,"now was he slumbering towards heaven's gate,"
3655,8,that he might at the threshold one hour wait
3656,8,"to hear the marriage melodies, and then"
3657,8,"sink downward to his dusky cave again,"
3658,8,"his litter of smooth semilucent mist,"
3659,8,"diversely ting'd with rose and amethyst,"
3660,8,puzzled those eyes that for the centre sought;
3661,8,and scarcely for one moment could be caught
3662,8,"his sluggish form reposing motionless,"
3663,8,"those two on winged steeds, with all the stress"
3664,8,"of vision search'd for him, as one would look"
3665,8,athwart the sallows of a river nook
3666,8,"to catch a glance at silver throated eels,--"
3667,8,"or from old skiddaw's top, when fog conceals"
3668,8,"his rugged forehead in a mantle pale,"
3669,8,with an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale
3670,8,"descry a favourite hamlet faint and far,"
3671,8,
3672,8," these raven horses, though they foster'd are"
3673,8,"of earth's splenetic fire, dully drop"
3674,8,"their full-veined ears, nostrils blood wide, and stop;"
3675,8,upon the spiritless mist have they outspread
3676,8,"their ample feathers, are in slumber dead,--"
3677,8,"and on those pinions, level in mid air,"
3678,8,"endymion sleepeth and the lady fair,"
3679,8,"slowly they sail, slowly as icy isle"
3680,8,"upon a calm sea drifting, and meanwhile"
3681,8,"the mournful wanderer dreams, behold! he walks"
3682,8,on heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks
3683,8,"to divine powers, from his hand full fain"
3684,8,"juno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain,"
3685,8,"he tries the nerve of phoebus' golden bow,"
3686,8,"and asketh where the golden apples grow,"
3687,8,"upon his arm he braces pallas' shield,"
3688,8,and strives in vain to unsettle and wield
3689,8,"a jovian thunderbolt, arch hebe brings"
3690,8,"a full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings"
3691,8,"and tantalizes long; at last he drinks,"
3692,8,"and lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,"
3693,8,"touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand,"
3694,8,"he blows a bugle,--an ethereal band"
3695,8,"are visible above, the seasons four,--"
3696,8,"green-kyrtled spring, flush summer, golden store"
3697,8,"in autumn's sickle, winter frosty hoar,"
3698,8,"join dance with shadowy hours; while still the blast,"
3699,8,"in swells unmitigated, still doth last"
3700,8,"to sway their floating morris, whose is this?"
3701,8,"whose bugle? he inquires, they smile--o dis!"
3702,8,why is this mortal here? dost thou not know
3703,8,"its mistress' lips? not thou?--'tis dian's, lo!"
3704,8,"she rises crescented! he looks, 'tis she,"
3705,8,"his very goddess, good-bye earth, and sea,"
3706,8,"and air, and pains, and care, and suffering;"
3707,8,good-bye to all but love! then doth he spring
3708,8,"towards her, and awakes--and, strange, o'erhead,"
3709,8,"of those same fragrant exhalations bred,"
3710,8,"beheld awake his very dream, the gods"
3711,8,stood smiling; merry hebe laughs and nods;
3712,8,"and phoebe bends towards him crescented,"
3713,8,"o state perplexing! on the pinion bed,"
3714,8,"too well awake, he feels the panting side"
3715,8,"of his delicious lady, he who died"
3716,8,"for soaring too audacious in the sun,"
3717,8,"where that same treacherous wax began to run,"
3718,8,"felt not more tongue-tied than endymion,"
3719,8,"his heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,"
3720,8,to that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way--
3721,8,"ah, what perplexity! ah, well a day!"
3722,8,"so fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,"
3723,8,"he could not help but kiss her, then he grew"
3724,8,awhile forgetful of all beauty save
3725,8,"young phoebe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave"
3726,8,"forgiveness, yet he turn'd once more to look"
3727,8,"at the sweet sleeper,--all his soul was shook,--"
3728,8,she press'd his hand in slumber; so once more
3729,8,"he could not help but kiss her and adore,"
3730,8,"at this the shadow wept, melting away,"
3731,8,"the latmian started up, bright goddess, stay!"
3732,8,"search my most hidden breast! by truth's own tongue,"
3733,8,"i have no dædale heart, why is it wrung"
3734,8,"to desperation? is there nought for me,"
3735,8,"upon the bourne of bliss, but misery?"
3736,8,
3737,8," these words awoke the stranger of dark tresses,"
3738,8,her dawning love-look rapt endymion blesses
3739,8,"with 'haviour soft, sleep yawned from underneath,"
3740,8,"thou swan of ganges, let us no more breathe"
3741,8,this murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st
3742,8,"pillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st"
3743,8,"what horrors may discomfort thee and me,"
3744,8,"ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!--"
3745,8,yet did she merely weep--her gentle soul
3746,8,"hath no revenge in it, as it is whole"
3747,8,"in tenderness, would i were whole in love!"
3748,8,"can i prize thee, fair maid, all price above,"
3749,8,even when i feel as true as innocence?
3750,8,"i do, i do,--what is this soul then? whence"
3751,8,"came it? it does not seem my own, and i"
3752,8,"have no self-passion or identity,"
3753,8,"some fearful end must be, where, where is it?"
3754,8,"by nemesis, i see my spirit flit"
3755,8,"alone about the dark--forgive me, sweet,"
3756,8,"shall we away? he rous'd the steeds, they beat"
3757,8,"their wings chivalrous into the clear air,"
3758,8,"leaving old sleep within his vapoury lair,"
3759,8,
3760,8," the good-night blush of eve was waning slow,"
3761,8,"and vesper, risen star, began to throe"
3762,8,"in the dusk heavens silvery, when they"
3763,8,"thus sprang direct towards the galaxy,"
3764,8,nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange--
3765,8,"eternal oaths and vows they interchange,"
3766,8,"in such wise, in such temper, so aloof"
3767,8,"up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,"
3768,8,"so witless of their doom, that verily"
3769,8,'tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;
3770,8,"whether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd--"
3771,8,"most like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy'd,"
3772,8,
3773,8," full facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,"
3774,8,"the moon put forth a little diamond peak,"
3775,8,"no bigger than an unobserved star,"
3776,8,or tiny point of fairy scymetar;
3777,8,bright signal that she only stoop'd to tie
3778,8,"her silver sandals, ere deliciously"
3779,8,"she bow'd into the heavens her timid head,"
3780,8,"slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,"
3781,8,"while to his lady meek the carian turn'd,"
3782,8,to mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd
3783,8,this beauty in its birth--despair! despair!
3784,8,he saw her body fading gaunt and spare
3785,8,"in the cold moonshine, straight he seiz'd her wrist;"
3786,8,"it melted from his grasp, her hand he kiss'd,"
3787,8,"and, horror! kiss'd his own--he was alone,"
3788,8,"her steed a little higher soar'd, and then"
3789,8,"dropt hawkwise to the earth,        there lies a den,"
3790,8,beyond the seeming confines of the space
3791,8,made for the soul to wander in and trace
3792,8,"its own existence, of remotest glooms,"
3793,8,"dark regions are around it, where the tombs"
3794,8,"of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce"
3795,8,"one hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce"
3796,8,"of new-born woe it feels more inly smart,"
3797,8,and in these regions many a venom'd dart
3798,8,at random flies; they are the proper home
3799,8,"of every ill, the man is yet to come"
3800,8,"who hath not journeyed in this native hell,"
3801,8,but few have ever felt how calm and well
3802,8,"sleep may be had in that deep den of all,"
3803,8,"there anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall,"
3804,8,"woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,"
3805,8,"yet all is still within and desolate,"
3806,8,"beset with painful gusts, within ye hear"
3807,8,no sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier
3808,8,"the death-watch tick is stifled, enter none"
3809,8,"who strive therefore, on the sudden it is won,"
3810,8,"just when the sufferer begins to burn,"
3811,8,"then it is free to him; and from an urn,"
3812,8,"still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught--"
3813,8,young semele such richness never quaft
3814,8,"in her maternal longing, happy gloom!"
3815,8,dark paradise! where pale becomes the bloom
3816,8,of health by due; where silence dreariest
3817,8,is most articulate; where hopes infest;
3818,8,where those eyes are the brightest far that keep
3819,8,"their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep,"
3820,8,o happy spirit-home! o wondrous soul!
3821,8,pregnant with such a den to save the whole
3822,8,"in thine own depth, hail, gentle carian!"
3823,8,"for, never since thy griefs and woes began,"
3824,8,"hast thou felt so content, a grievous feud"
3825,8,"hath let thee to this cave of quietude,"
3826,8,"aye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne"
3827,8,"with dangerous speed, and so he did not mourn"
3828,8,"because he knew not whither he was going,"
3829,8,"so happy was he, not the aerial blowing"
3830,8,of trumpets at clear parley from the east
3831,8,"could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast,"
3832,8,"they stung the feather'd horse, with fierce alarm"
3833,8,"he flapp'd towards the sound, alas, no charm"
3834,8,"could lift endymion's head, or he had view'd"
3835,8,"a skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,--"
3836,8,"and silvery was its passing, voices sweet"
3837,8,warbling the while as if to lull and greet
3838,8,"the wanderer in his path, thus warbled they,"
3839,8,"while past the vision went in bright array,"
3840,8,
3841,8," who, who from dian's feast would be away?"
3842,8,for all the golden bowers of the day
3843,8,"are empty left? who, who away would be"
3844,8,from cynthia's wedding and festivity?
3845,8,"not hesperus, lo! upon his silver wings"
3846,8,"he leans away for highest heaven and sings,"
3847,8,snapping his lucid fingers merrily!--
3848,8,"ah, zephyrus! art here, and flora too!"
3849,8,"ye tender bibbers of the rain and dew,"
3850,8,"young playmates of the rose and daffodil,"
3851,8,"be careful, ere ye enter in, to fill"
3852,8,       your baskets high
3853,8,"with fennel green, and balm, and golden pines,"
3854,8,"savory, latter-mint, and columbines,"
3855,8,"cool parsley, basil sweet, and sunny thyme;"
3856,8,"yea, every flower and leaf of every clime,"
3857,8,"all gather'd in the dewy morning, hie"
3858,8,"       away! fly, fly!--"
3859,8,"crystalline brother of the belt of heaven,"
3860,8,aquarius! to whom king jove has given
3861,8,"two liquid pulse streams 'stead of feather'd wings,"
3862,8,"two fan-like fountains,--thine illuminings"
3863,8,"       for dian play,"
3864,8,dissolve the frozen purity of air;
3865,8,let thy white shoulders silvery and bare
3866,8,shew cold through watery pinions; make more bright
3867,8,"the star-queen's crescent on her marriage night,"
3868,8,"       haste, haste away!--"
3869,8,"castor has tamed the planet lion, see!"
3870,8,"and of the bear has pollux mastery,"
3871,8,"a third is in the race! who is the third,"
3872,8,speeding away swift as the eagle bird?
3873,8,       the ramping centaur!
3874,8,"the lion's mane's on end, the bear how fierce!"
3875,8,the centaur's arrow ready seems to pierce
3876,8,"some enemy, far forth his bow is bent"
3877,8,"into the blue of heaven, he'll be shent,"
3878,8,"       pale unrelentor,"
3879,8,"when he shall hear the wedding lutes a playing,--"
3880,8,andromeda! sweet woman! why delaying
3881,8,"so timidly among the stars, come hither!"
3882,8,"join this bright throng, and nimbly follow whither"
3883,8,"       they all are going,"
3884,8,"danae's son, before jove newly bow'd,"
3885,8,"has wept for thee, calling to jove aloud,"
3886,8,"thee, gentle lady, did he disenthral,"
3887,8,"ye shall for ever live and love, for all"
3888,8,"       thy tears are flowing,--"
3889,8,"by daphne's fright, behold apollo!--"
3890,8,
3891,8,                                       more
3892,8,"endymion heard not, down his steed him bore,"
3893,8,"prone to the green head of a misty hill,"
3894,8,
3895,8," his first touch of the earth went nigh to kill,"
3896,8,"alas! said he, were i but always borne"
3897,8,"through dangerous winds, had but my footsteps worn"
3898,8,"a path in hell, for ever would i bless"
3899,8,horrors which nourish an uneasiness
3900,8,"for my own sullen conquering, to him"
3901,8,"who lives beyond earth's boundary, grief is dim,"
3902,8,"sorrow is but a shadow, now i see"
3903,8,"the grass; i feel the solid ground--ah, me!"
3904,8,it is thy voice--divinest! where?--who? who
3905,8,left thee so quiet on this bed of dew?
3906,8,behold upon this happy earth we are;
3907,8,let us ay love each other; let us fare
3908,8,"on forest-fruits, and never, never go"
3909,8,"among the abodes of mortals here below,"
3910,8,"or be by phantoms duped, o destiny!"
3911,8,"into a labyrinth now my soul would fly,"
3912,8,"but with thy beauty will i deaden it,"
3913,8,where didst thou melt too? by thee will i sit
3914,8,"for ever, let our fate stop here--a kid"
3915,8,"i on this spot will offer, pan will bid"
3916,8,"us live in peace, in love and peace among"
3917,8,"his forest wildernesses, i have clung"
3918,8,"to nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen"
3919,8,or felt but a great dream! o i have been
3920,8,"presumptuous against love, against the sky,"
3921,8,"against all elements, against the tie"
3922,8,"of mortals each to each, against the blooms"
3923,8,"of flowers, rush of rivers, and the tombs"
3924,8,of heroes gone! against his proper glory
3925,8,"has my own soul conspired, so my story"
3926,8,"will i to children utter, and repent,"
3927,8,"there never liv'd a mortal man, who bent"
3928,8,"his appetite beyond his natural sphere,"
3929,8,"but starv'd and died, my sweetest indian, here,"
3930,8,"here will i kneel, for thou redeemed hast"
3931,8,"my life from too thin breathing, gone and past"
3932,8,"are cloudy phantasms, caverns lone, farewel!"
3933,8,"and air of visions, and the monstrous swell"
3934,8,"of visionary seas! no, never more"
3935,8,shall airy voices cheat me to the shore
3936,8,"of tangled wonder, breathless and aghast,"
3937,8,"adieu, my daintiest dream! although so vast"
3938,8,"my love is still for thee, the hour may come"
3939,8,"when we shall meet in pure elysium,"
3940,8,on earth i may not love thee; and therefore
3941,8,"doves will i offer up, and sweetest store"
3942,8,"all through the teeming year, so thou wilt shine"
3943,8,"on me, and on this damsel fair of mine,"
3944,8,"and bless our simple lives, my indian bliss!"
3945,8,my river-lily bud! one human kiss!
3946,8,"one sigh of real breath--one gentle squeeze,"
3947,8,"warm as a dove's nest among summer trees,"
3948,8,and warm with dew at ooze from living blood!
3949,8,"whither didst melt? ah, what of that!--all good"
3950,8,"we'll talk about--no more of dreaming,--now,"
3951,8,where shall our dwelling be? under the brow
3952,8,"of some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun"
3953,8,"would hide us up, although spring leaves were none;"
3954,8,"and where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,"
3955,8,will drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?
3956,8,o thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;
3957,8,"dusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace"
3958,8,"those gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin'd,"
3959,8,"for by one step the blue sky shouldst thou find,"
3960,8,"and by another, in deep dell below,"
3961,8,"see, through the trees, a little river go"
3962,8,"all in its mid-day gold and glimmering,"
3963,8,"honey from out the gnarled hive i'll bring,"
3964,8,"and apples, wan with sweetness, gather thee,--"
3965,8,"cresses that grow where no man may them see,"
3966,8,"and sorrel untorn by the dew-claw'd stag,"
3967,8,"pipes will i fashion of the syrinx flag,"
3968,8,"that thou mayst always know whither i roam,"
3969,8,when it shall please thee in our quiet home
3970,8,"to listen and think of love, still let me speak;"
3971,8,"still let me dive into the joy i seek,--"
3972,8,"for yet the past doth prison me, the rill,"
3973,8,"thou haply mayst delight in, will i fill"
3974,8,"with fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,"
3975,8,"and thou shalt feed them from the squirrel's barn,"
3976,8,"its bottom will i strew with amber shells,"
3977,8,"and pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells,"
3978,8,"its sides i'll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,"
3979,8,"and honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine,"
3980,8,i will entice this crystal rill to trace
3981,8,"love's silver name upon the meadow's face,"
3982,8,"i'll kneel to vesta, for a flame of fire;"
3983,8,"and to god phoebus, for a golden lyre;"
3984,8,"to empress dian, for a hunting spear;"
3985,8,"to vesper, for a taper silver-clear,"
3986,8,that i may see thy beauty through the night;
3987,8,"to flora, and a nightingale shall light"
3988,8,"tame on thy finger; to the river-gods,"
3989,8,and they shall bring thee taper fishing-rods
3990,8,"of gold, and lines of naiads' long bright tress,"
3991,8,heaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!
3992,8,thy mossy footstool shall the altar be
3993,8,"'fore which i'll bend, bending, dear love, to thee,"
3994,8,"those lips shall be my delphos, and shall speak"
3995,8,"laws to my footsteps, colour to my cheek,"
3996,8,"trembling or stedfastness to this same voice,"
3997,8,"and of three sweetest pleasurings the choice,"
3998,8,"and that affectionate light, those diamond things,"
3999,8,"those eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,"
4000,8,"shall be my grief, or twinkle me to pleasure,"
4001,8,"say, is not bliss within our perfect seisure?"
4002,8,o that i could not doubt?
4003,8,
4004,8,                             the mountaineer
4005,8,thus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear
4006,8,"his briar'd path to some tranquillity,"
4007,8,"it gave bright gladness to his lady's eye,"
4008,8,and yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;
4009,8,"answering thus, just as the golden morrow"
4010,8,"beam'd upward from the vallies of the east,"
4011,8,"o that the flutter of this heart had ceas'd,"
4012,8,"or the sweet name of love had pass'd away,"
4013,8,young feather'd tyrant! by a swift decay
4014,8,"wilt thou devote this body to the earth,"
4015,8,and i do think that at my very birth
4016,8,i lisp'd thy blooming titles inwardly;
4017,8,"for at the first, first dawn and thought of thee,"
4018,8,"with uplift hands i blest the stars of heaven,"
4019,8,art thou not cruel? ever have i striven
4020,8,"to think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!"
4021,8,"when yet a child, i heard that kisses drew"
4022,8,"favour from thee, and so i kisses gave"
4023,8,"to the void air, bidding them find out love,"
4024,8,but when i came to feel how far above
4025,8,"all fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,"
4026,8,"all earthly pleasure, all imagin'd good,"
4027,8,"was the warm tremble of a devout kiss,--"
4028,8,"even then, that moment, at the thought of this,"
4029,8,"fainting i fell into a bed of flowers,"
4030,8,"and languish'd there three days, ye milder powers,"
4031,8,"am i not cruelly wrong'd? believe, believe"
4032,8,"me, dear endymion, were i to weave"
4033,8,"with my own fancies garlands of sweet life,"
4034,8,"thou shouldst be one of all, ah, bitter strife!"
4035,8,"i may not be thy love, i am forbidden--"
4036,8,"indeed i am--thwarted, affrighted, chidden,"
4037,8,"by things i trembled at, and gorgon wrath,"
4038,8,"twice hast thou ask'd whither i went, henceforth"
4039,8,"ask me no more! i may not utter it,"
4040,8,"nor may i be thy love, we might commit"
4041,8,ourselves at once to vengeance; we might die;
4042,8,"we might embrace and die, voluptuous thought!"
4043,8,"enlarge not to my hunger, or i'm caught"
4044,8,"in trammels of perverse deliciousness,"
4045,8,"no, no, that shall not be, thee will i bless,"
4046,8,"and bid a long adieu,"
4047,8,
4048,8,                         the carian
4049,8,"no word return'd, both lovelorn, silent, wan,"
4050,8,"into the vallies green together went,"
4051,8,"far wandering, they were perforce content"
4052,8,to sit beneath a fair lone beechen tree;
4053,8,"nor at each other gaz'd, but heavily"
4054,8,"por'd on its hazle cirque of shedded leaves,"
4055,8,
4056,8, endymion! unhappy! it nigh grieves
4057,8,"me to behold thee thus in last extreme,"
4058,8,"ensky'd ere this, but truly that i deem"
4059,8,"truth the best music in a first-born song,"
4060,8,"thy lute-voic'd brother will i sing ere long,"
4061,8,and thou shalt aid--hast thou not aided me?
4062,8,"yes, moonlight emperor! felicity"
4063,8,has been thy meed for many thousand years;
4064,8,"yet often have i, on the brink of tears,"
4065,8,"mourn'd as if yet thou wert a forester,--"
4066,8,"forgetting the old tale,"
4067,8,
4068,8,                           he did not stir
4069,8,"his eyes from the dead leaves, or one small pulse"
4070,8,"of joy he might have felt, the spirit culls"
4071,8,"unfaded amaranth, when wild it strays"
4072,8,"through the old garden-ground of boyish days,"
4073,8,a little onward ran the very stream
4074,8,by which he took his first soft poppy dream;
4075,8,and on the very bark 'gainst which he leant
4076,8,"a crescent he had carv'd, and round it spent"
4077,8,"his skill in little stars, the teeming tree"
4078,8,"had swollen and green'd the pious charactery,"
4079,8,"but not ta'en out, why, there was not a slope"
4080,8,up which he had not fear'd the antelope;
4081,8,"and not a tree, beneath whose rooty shade"
4082,8,"he had not with his tamed leopards play'd,"
4083,8,"nor could an arrow light, or javelin,"
4084,8,fly in the air where his had never been--
4085,8,"and yet he knew it not,"
4086,8,
4087,8,                         o treachery!
4088,8,"why does his lady smile, pleasing her eye"
4089,8,"with all his sorrowing? he sees her not,"
4090,8,but who so stares on him? his sister sure!
4091,8,peona of the woods!--can she endure--
4092,8,impossible--how dearly they embrace!
4093,8,his lady smiles; delight is in her face;
4094,8,"it is no treachery,"
4095,8,
4096,8,                     dear brother mine!
4097,8,"endymion, weep not so! why shouldst thou pine"
4098,8,when all great latmos so exalt wilt be?
4099,8,"thank the great gods, and look not bitterly;"
4100,8,"and speak not one pale word, and sigh no more,"
4101,8,sure i will not believe thou hast such store
4102,8,"of grief, to last thee to my kiss again,"
4103,8,"thou surely canst not bear a mind in pain,"
4104,8,"come hand in hand with one so beautiful,"
4105,8,be happy both of you! for i will pull
4106,8,"the flowers of autumn for your coronals,"
4107,8,pan's holy priest for young endymion calls;
4108,8,"and when he is restor'd, thou, fairest dame,"
4109,8,"shalt be our queen, now, is it not a shame"
4110,8,"to see ye thus,--not very, very sad?"
4111,8,"perhaps ye are too happy to be glad,"
4112,8,o feel as if it were a common day;
4113,8,"free-voic'd as one who never was away,"
4114,8,"no tongue shall ask, whence come ye? but ye shall"
4115,8,"be gods of your own rest imperial,"
4116,8,"not even i, for one whole month, will pry"
4117,8,"into the hours that have pass'd us by,"
4118,8,"since in my arbour i did sing to thee,"
4119,8,o hermes! on this very night will be
4120,8,"a hymning up to cynthia, queen of light;"
4121,8,for the soothsayers old saw yesternight
4122,8,"good visions in the air,--whence will befal,"
4123,8,"as say these sages, health perpetual"
4124,8,"to shepherds and their flocks; and furthermore,"
4125,8,"in dian's face they read the gentle lore,"
4126,8,"therefore for her these vesper-carols are,"
4127,8,"our friends will all be there from nigh and far,"
4128,8,many upon thy death have ditties made;
4129,8,"and many, even now, their foreheads shade"
4130,8,"with cypress, on a day of sacrifice,"
4131,8,"new singing for our maids shalt thou devise,"
4132,8,"and pluck the sorrow from our huntsmen's brows,"
4133,8,"tell me, my lady-queen, how to espouse"
4134,8,this wayward brother to his rightful joys!
4135,8,"his eyes are on thee bent, as thou didst poise"
4136,8,"his fate most goddess-like, help me, i pray,"
4137,8,"to lure--endymion, dear brother, say"
4138,8,"what ails thee? he could bear no more, and so"
4139,8,"bent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,"
4140,8,"and twang'd it inwardly, and calmly said,"
4141,8,"i would have thee my only friend, sweet maid!"
4142,8,"my only visitor! not ignorant though,"
4143,8,that those deceptions which for pleasure go
4144,8,"'mong men, are pleasures real as real may be,"
4145,8,"but there are higher ones i may not see,"
4146,8,"if impiously an earthly realm i take,"
4147,8,"since i saw thee, i have been wide awake"
4148,8,"night after night, and day by day, until"
4149,8,"of the empyrean i have drunk my fill,"
4150,8,"let it content thee, sister, seeing me"
4151,8,"more happy than betides mortality,"
4152,8,"a hermit young, i'll live in mossy cave,"
4153,8,"where thou alone shalt come to me, and lave"
4154,8,"thy spirit in the wonders i shall tell,"
4155,8,through me the shepherd realm shall prosper well;
4156,8,"for to thy tongue will i all health confide,"
4157,8,"and, for my sake, let this young maid abide"
4158,8,"with thee as a dear sister, thou alone,"
4159,8,"peona, mayst return to me, i own"
4160,8,"this may sound strangely, but when, dearest girl,"
4161,8,"thou seest it for my happiness, no pearl"
4162,8,"will trespass down those cheeks, companion fair!"
4163,8,"wilt be content to dwell with her, to share"
4164,8,this sister's love with me? like one resign'd
4165,8,"and bent by circumstance, and thereby blind"
4166,8,"in self-commitment, thus that meek unknown,"
4167,8,"aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,"
4168,8,"of jubilee to dian,--truth i heard!"
4169,8,"well then, i see there is no little bird,"
4170,8,"tender soever, but is jove's own care,"
4171,8,"long have i sought for rest, and, unaware,"
4172,8,behold i find it! so exalted too!
4173,8,"so after my own heart! i knew, i knew"
4174,8,"there was a place untenanted in it,"
4175,8,"in that same void white chastity shall sit,"
4176,8,"and monitor me nightly to lone slumber,"
4177,8,with sanest lips i vow me to the number
4178,8,"of dian's sisterhood; and, kind lady,"
4179,8,"with thy good help, this very night shall see"
4180,8,"my future days to her fane consecrate,"
4181,8,
4182,8, as feels a dreamer what doth most create
4183,8,"his own particular fright, so these three felt,"
4184,8,"or like one who, in after ages, knelt"
4185,8,"to lucifer or baal, when he'd pine"
4186,8,"after a little sleep, or when in mine"
4187,8,"far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends"
4188,8,"who know him not, each diligently bends"
4189,8,towards common thoughts and things for very fear;
4190,8,"striving their ghastly malady to cheer,"
4191,8,"by thinking it a thing of yes and no,"
4192,8,"that housewives talk of, but the spirit-blow"
4193,8,"was struck, and all were dreamers, at the last"
4194,8,"endymion said, are not our fates all cast?"
4195,8,"why stand we here? adieu, ye tender pair!"
4196,8,"adieu! whereat those maidens, with wild stare,"
4197,8,"walk'd dizzily away, pained and hot"
4198,8,"his eyes went after them, until they got"
4199,8,"near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,"
4200,8,"in one swift moment, would what then he saw"
4201,8,"engulph for ever, stay! he cried, ah, stay!"
4202,8,"turn, damsels! hist! one word i have to say,"
4203,8,"sweet indian, i would see thee once again,"
4204,8,"it is a thing i dote on, so i'd fain,"
4205,8,"peona, ye should hand in hand repair"
4206,8,"into those holy groves, that silent are"
4207,8,"behind great dian's temple, i'll be yon,"
4208,8,at vesper's earliest twinkle--they are gone--
4209,8,"but once, once, once again-- at this he press'd"
4210,8,"his hands against his face, and then did rest"
4211,8,"his head upon a mossy hillock green,"
4212,8,and so remain'd as he a corpse had been
4213,8,all the long day; save when he scantly lifted
4214,8,"his eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted"
4215,8,"with the slow move of time,--sluggish and weary"
4216,8,"until the poplar tops, in journey dreary,"
4217,8,"had reach'd the river's brim, then up he rose,"
4218,8,"and, slowly as that very river flows,"
4219,8,"walk'd towards the temple grove with this lament,"
4220,8,why such a golden eve? the breeze is sent
4221,8,"careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall"
4222,8,before the serene father of them all
4223,8,"bows down his summer head below the west,"
4224,8,"now am i of breath, speech, and speed possest,"
4225,8,but at the setting i must bid adieu
4226,8,"to her for the last time, night will strew"
4227,8,"on the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,"
4228,8,and with them shall i die; nor much it grieves
4229,8,"to die, when summer dies on the cold sward,"
4230,8,"why, i have been a butterfly, a lord"
4231,8,"of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,"
4232,8,"groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;"
4233,8,"my kingdom's at its death, and just it is"
4234,8,"that i should die with it, so in all this"
4235,8,"we miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,"
4236,8,what is there to plain of? by titan's foe
4237,8,"i am but rightly serv'd, so saying, he"
4238,8,"tripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;"
4239,8,"laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,"
4240,8,"as though they jests had been, nor had he done"
4241,8,"his laugh at nature's holy countenance,"
4242,8,"until that grove appear'd, as if perchance,"
4243,8,and then his tongue with sober seemlihed
4244,8,"gave utterance as he entered, ha! i said,"
4245,8,"king of the butterflies; but by this gloom,"
4246,8,"and by old rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,"
4247,8,"this dusk religion, pomp of solitude,"
4248,8,"and the promethean clay by thief endued,"
4249,8,"by old saturnus' forelock, by his head"
4250,8,"shook with eternal palsy, i did wed"
4251,8,myself to things of light from infancy;
4252,8,"and thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,"
4253,8,is sure enough to make a mortal man
4254,8,"grow impious, so he inwardly began"
4255,8,on things for which no wording can be found;
4256,8,"deeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd"
4257,8,"beyond the reach of music, for the choir"
4258,8,"of cynthia he heard not, though rough briar"
4259,8,nor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull
4260,8,"the vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,"
4261,8,"through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles,"
4262,8,"he saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,"
4263,8,wan as primroses gather'd at midnight
4264,8,"by chilly finger'd spring, unhappy wight!"
4265,8,"endymion! said peona, we are here!"
4266,8,what wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?
4267,8,"then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand"
4268,8,"press'd, saying, sister, i would have command,"
4269,8,"if it were heaven's will, on our sad fate,"
4270,8,at which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate
4271,8,"and said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,"
4272,8,"to endymion's amaze, by cupid's dove,"
4273,8,and so thou shalt! and by the lily truth
4274,8,"of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!"
4275,8,"and as she spake, into her face there came"
4276,8,"light, as reflected from a silver flame,"
4277,8,"her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display"
4278,8,full golden; in her eyes a brighter day
4279,8,"dawn'd blue and full of love, aye, he beheld"
4280,8,"phoebe, his passion! joyous she upheld"
4281,8,"her lucid bow, continuing thus; drear, drear"
4282,8,has our delaying been; but foolish fear
4283,8,withheld me first; and then decrees of fate;
4284,8,and then 'twas fit that from this mortal state
4285,8,"thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change"
4286,8,"be spiritualiz'd, peona, we shall range"
4287,8,"these forests, and to thee they safe shall be"
4288,8,as was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee
4289,8,"to meet us many a time, next cynthia bright"
4290,8,"peona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night,"
4291,8,"her brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown"
4292,8,"before his goddess, in a blissful swoon,"
4293,8,"she gave her fair hands to him, and behold,"
4294,8,"before three swiftest kisses he had told,"
4295,8,they vanish'd far away!--peona went
4296,8,"home through the gloomy wood in wonderment,"
4297,9,"full many a dreary hour have i past,"
4298,9,"my brain bewildered, and my mind o'ercast"
4299,9,with heaviness; in seasons when i've thought
4300,9,no spherey strains by me could e'er be caught
4301,9,"from the blue dome, though i to dimness gaze"
4302,9,on the far depth where sheeted lightning plays;
4303,9,"or, on the wavy grass outstretched supinely,"
4304,9,"pry 'mong the stars, to strive to think divinely,"
4305,9,"that i should never hear apollo's song,"
4306,9,though feathery clouds were floating all along
4307,9,"the purple west, and, two bright streaks between,"
4308,9,"the golden lyre itself were dimly seen,"
4309,9,that the still murmur of the honey bee
4310,9,"would never teach a rural song to me,"
4311,9,that the bright glance from beauty's eyelids slanting
4312,9,"would never make a lay of mine enchanting,"
4313,9,or warm my breast with ardour to unfold
4314,9,"some tale of love and arms in time of old,"
4315,9,
4316,9,"but there are times, when those that love the bay,"
4317,9,"fly from all sorrowing far, far away;"
4318,9,"a sudden glow comes on them, nought they see"
4319,9,"in water, earth, or air, but poesy,"
4320,9,"it has been said, dear george, and true i hold it,"
4321,9,"for knightly spenser to libertas told it,"
4322,9,"that when a poet is in such a trance,"
4323,9,"in air her sees white coursers paw, and prance,"
4324,9,"bestridden of gay knights, in gay apparel,"
4325,9,"who at each other tilt in playful quarrel,"
4326,9,"and what we, ignorantly, sheet-lightning call,"
4327,9,"is the swift opening of their wide portal,"
4328,9,"when the bright warder blows his trumpet clear,"
4329,9,"whose tones reach nought on earth but poet's ear,"
4330,9,"when these enchanted portals open wide,"
4331,9,"and through the light the horsemen swiftly glide,"
4332,9,"the poet's eye can reach those golden halls,"
4333,9,"and view the glory of their festivals,"
4334,9,"their ladies fair, that in the distance seem"
4335,9,fit for the silv'ring of a seraph's dream;
4336,9,"their rich brimmed goblets, that incessant run"
4337,9,like the bright spots that move about the sun;
4338,9,"and, when upheld, the wine from each bright jar"
4339,9,"pours with the lustre of a falling star,"
4340,9,"yet further off, are dimly seen their bowers,"
4341,9,"of which, no mortal eye can reach the flowers;"
4342,9,"and 'tis right just, for well apollo knows"
4343,9,"'twould make the poet quarrel with the rose,"
4344,9,all that's revealed from that far seat of blisses
4345,9,"is the clear fountains' interchanging kisses,"
4346,9,"as gracefully descending, light and thin,"
4347,9,"like silver streaks across a dolphin's fin,"
4348,9,"when he upswimmeth from the coral caves,"
4349,9,"and sports with half his tail above the waves,"
4350,9,
4351,9,"these wonders strange he sees, and many more,"
4352,9,"whose head is pregnant with poetic lore,"
4353,9,should he upon an evening ramble fare
4354,9,"with forehead to the soothing breezes bare,"
4355,9,"would he nought see but the dark, silent blue"
4356,9,with all its diamonds trembling through and through?
4357,9,"or the coy moon, when in the waviness"
4358,9,"of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress,"
4359,9,"and staidly paces higher up, and higher,"
4360,9,like a sweet nun in holy-day attire?
4361,9,"ah, yes! much more would start into his sight—"
4362,9,"the revelries and mysteries of night,"
4363,9,"and should i ever see them, i will tell you"
4364,9,"such tales as needs must with amazement spell you,"
4365,9,
4366,9,"these are the living pleasures of the bard,"
4367,9,"but richer far posterity's reward,"
4368,9,"what does he murmur with his latest breath,"
4369,9,while his proud eye looks though the film of death?
4370,9,"what though i leave this dull and earthly mould,"
4371,9,yet shall my spirit lofty converse hold
4372,9,"with after times,—the patriot shall feel"
4373,9,"my stern alarum, and unsheath his steel;"
4374,9,"or, in the senate thunder out my numbers"
4375,9,"to startle princes from their easy slumbers,"
4376,9,the sage will mingle with each moral theme
4377,9,my happy thoughts sententious; he will teem
4378,9,"with lofty periods when my verses fire him,"
4379,9,"and then i'll stoop from heaven to inspire him,"
4380,9,lays have i left of such a dear delight
4381,9,"that maids will sing them on their bridal night,"
4382,9,"gay villagers, upon a morn of may,"
4383,9,when they have tired their gentle limbs with play
4384,9,"and formed a snowy circle on the grass,"
4385,9,and placed in midst of all that lovely lass
4386,9,"who chosen is their queen,—with her fine head"
4387,9,"crowned with flowers purple, white, and red,"
4388,9,"for there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing,"
4389,9,"are emblems true of hapless lovers dying,"
4390,9,"between her breasts, that never yet felt trouble,"
4391,9,"a bunch of violets full blown, and double,"
4392,9,"serenely sleep,—she from a casket takes"
4393,9,"a little book,—and then a joy awakes"
4394,9,"about each youthful heart,—with stifled cries,"
4395,9,"and rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes,"
4396,9,"for she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears;"
4397,9,"one that i fostered in my youthful years,"
4398,9,"the pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep,"
4399,9,"must ever and anon with silent creep,"
4400,9,"lured by the innocent dimples, to sweet rest"
4401,9,"shall the dear babe, upon its mother's breast,"
4402,9,"be lulled with songs of mine, fair world, adieu!"
4403,9,"thy dales, and hills, are fading from my view,"
4404,9,"swiftly i mount, upon wide spreading pinions,"
4405,9,"far from the narrow bound of thy dominions,"
4406,9,"full joy i feel, while thus i cleave the air,"
4407,9,"that my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair,"
4408,9,"and warm thy sons! ah, my dear friend and brother,"
4409,9,"could i, at once, my mad ambition smother,"
4410,9,"for tasting joys like these, sure i should be"
4411,9,"happier, and dearer to society,"
4412,9,"at times, 'tis true, i've felt relief from pain"
4413,9,"when some bright thought has darted through my brain,"
4414,9,through all that day i've felt a greater pleasure
4415,9,"than if i'd brought to light a hidden treasure,"
4416,9,"as to my sonnets, though none else should heed them,"
4417,9,"i feel delighted, still, that you should read them,"
4418,9,"of late, too, i have had much calm enjoyment,"
4419,9,stretched on the grass at my best loved employment
4420,9,"of scribbling lines for you, these things i thought"
4421,9,"while, in my face, the freshest breeze i caught,"
4422,9,e'en now i'm pillowed on a bed of flowers
4423,9,"that crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers"
4424,9,"above the ocean-waves, the stalks, and blades,"
4425,9,"chequer my tablet with their quivering shades,"
4426,9,"on one side is a field of drooping oats,"
4427,9,through which the poppies show their scarlet coats;
4428,9,"so pert and useless, that they bring to mind"
4429,9,"the scarlet coats that pester human-kind,"
4430,9,"and on the other side, outspread, is seen"
4431,9,"ocean's blue mantle streaked with purple, and green,"
4432,9,"now 'tis i see a canvassed ship, and now"
4433,9,"mark the bright silver curling round her prow,"
4434,9,"i see the lark dowm-dropping to his nest,"
4435,9,and the broad winged sea-gull never at rest;
4436,9,"for when no more he spreads his feathers free,"
4437,9,"his breast is dancing on the restless sea,"
4438,9,"now i direct my eyes into the west,"
4439,9,"which at this moment is in sunbeams drest,"
4440,9,why westward turn? 'twas but to say adieu!
4441,9,"'twas but to kiss my hand, dear george, to you!"
4442,10,"ever let the fancy roam,"
4443,10,"  pleasure never is at home,"
4444,10,"  at a touch sweet pleasure melteth,"
4445,10,  like to bubbles when rain pelteth;
4446,10,  then let winged fancy wander
4447,10,"  through the thought still spread beyond her,"
4448,10,"  open wide the mind's cage-door,"
4449,10,"  she'll dart forth, and cloudward soar,"
4450,10,  o sweet fancy! let her loose;
4451,10,"  summer's joys are spoilt by use,"
4452,10,  and the enjoying of the spring
4453,10,  fades as does its blossoming;
4454,10,"  autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too,"
4455,10,"  blushing through the mist and dew,"
4456,10,"  cloys with tasting, what do then?"
4457,10,"  sit thee by the ingle, when"
4458,10,"  the sear faggot blazes bright,"
4459,10,  spirit of a winter's night;
4460,10,"  when the soundless earth is muffled,"
4461,10,  and the caked snow is shuffled
4462,10,  from the ploughboy's heavy shoon;
4463,10,  when the night doth meet the noon
4464,10,  in a dark conspiracy
4465,10,"  to banish even from her sky,"
4466,10,"  sit thee there, and send abroad,"
4467,10,"  with a mind self-overaw'd,"
4468,10,"  fancy, high-commission'd,--send her!"
4469,10,"  she has vassals to attend her,"
4470,10,"  she will bring, in spite of frost,"
4471,10,  beauties that the earth hath lost;
4472,10,"  she will bring thee, all together,"
4473,10,  all delights of summer weather;
4474,10,"  all the buds and bells of may,"
4475,10,  from dewy sward or thorny spray;
4476,10,"  all the heaped autumn's wealth,"
4477,10,"  with a still, mysterious stealth,"
4478,10,  she will mix these pleasures up
4479,10,"  like three fit wines in a cup,"
4480,10,"  and thou shalt quaff it,--thou shalt hear"
4481,10,  distant harvest-carols clear;
4482,10,  rustle of the reaped corn;
4483,10,"  sweet birds antheming the morn,"
4484,10,"  and, in the same moment, hark!"
4485,10,"  'tis the early april lark,"
4486,10,"  or the rooks, with busy caw,"
4487,10,"  foraging for sticks and straw,"
4488,10,"  thou shalt, at one glance, behold"
4489,10,  the daisy and the marigold;
4490,10,"  white-plum'd lillies, and the first"
4491,10,  hedge-grown primrose that hath burst;
4492,10,"  shaded hyacinth, alway"
4493,10,  sapphire queen of the mid-may;
4494,10,"  and every leaf, and every flower"
4495,10,"  pearled with the self-same shower,"
4496,10,  thou shalt see the field-mouse peep
4497,10,  meagre from its celled sleep;
4498,10,  and the snake all winter-thin
4499,10,  cast on sunny bank its skin;
4500,10,  freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see
4501,10,"    hatching in the hawthorn-tree,"
4502,10,  when the hen-bird's wing doth rest
4503,10,  quiet on her mossy nest;
4504,10,  then the hurry and alarm
4505,10,  when the bee-hive casts its swarm;
4506,10,"  acorns ripe down-pattering,"
4507,10,"  while the autumn breezes sing,"
4508,10,
4509,10,"      oh, sweet fancy! let her loose;"
4510,10,"  every thing is spoilt by use,"
4511,10,"  where's the cheek that doth not fade,"
4512,10,  too much gaz'd at? where's the maid
4513,10,  whose lip mature is ever new?
4514,10,"  where's the eye, however blue,"
4515,10,  doth not weary? where's the face
4516,10,  one would meet in every place?
4517,10,"  where's the voice, however soft,"
4518,10,  one would hear so very oft?
4519,10,  at a touch sweet pleasure melteth
4520,10,"  like to bubbles when rain pelteth,"
4521,10,"  let, then, winged fancy find"
4522,10,"  thee a mistress to thy mind,"
4523,10,"  dulcet-ey'd as ceres' daughter,"
4524,10,  ere the god of torment taught her
4525,10,  how to frown and how to chide;
4526,10,  with a waist and with a side
4527,10,"  white as hebe's, when her zone"
4528,10,"  slipt its golden clasp, and down"
4529,10,"  fell her kirtle to her feet,"
4530,10,  while she held the goblet sweet
4531,10,"  and jove grew languid,--break the mesh"
4532,10,  of the fancy's silken leash;
4533,10,  quickly break her prison-string
4534,10,"  and such joys as these she'll bring,--"
4535,10,"  let the winged fancy roam,"
4536,10,"  pleasure never is at home,"
4537,11,fill for me a brimming bowl
4538,11,"and in it let me drown my soul,"
4539,11,"but put therein some drug, designed"
4540,11,"to banish women from my mind,"
4541,11,for i want not the stream inspiring
4542,11,"that fills the mind with--fond desiring,"
4543,11,but i want as deep a draught
4544,11,as e'er from lethe's wave was quaff'd;
4545,11,from my despairing heart to charm
4546,11,the image of the fairest form
4547,11,"that e'er my reveling eyes beheld,"
4548,11,"that e'er my wandering fancy spell'd,"
4549,11,in vain! away i cannot chace
4550,11,"the melting softness of that face,"
4551,11,"the beaminess of those bright eyes,"
4552,11,"that breast--earth's only paradise,"
4553,11,my sight will never more be blest;
4554,11,"for all i see has lost its zest,"
4555,11,"nor with delight can i explore,"
4556,11,"the classic page, or muse's lore,"
4557,11,"had she but known how beat my heart,"
4558,11,and with one smile reliev'd its smart
4559,11,"i should have felt a sweet relief,"
4560,11,"i should have felt ``the joy of grief,''"
4561,11,yet as the tuscan mid the snow
4562,11,"of lapland dreams on sweet arno,"
4563,11,even so for ever shall she be
4564,11,"the halo of my memory,"
4565,12,mother of hermes! and still youthful maia!
4566,12,  may i sing to thee
4567,12,as thou wast hymned on the shores of baiae?
4568,12,  or may i woo thee
4569,12,in earlier sicilian? or thy smiles
4570,12,"seek as they once were sought, in grecian isles,"
4571,12,"by bards who died content on pleasant sward,"
4572,12,  leaving great verse unto a little clan?
4573,12,o give me their old vigour! and unheard
4574,12,"  save of the quiet primrose, and the span"
4575,12,"  of heaven, and few ears,"
4576,12,"rounded by thee, my song should die away"
4577,12,"  content as theirs,"
4578,12,"rich in the simple worship of a day,"
4579,13,"give me women, wine, and snuff"
4580,13,"until i cry out hold, enough!"
4581,13,you may do so sans objection
4582,13,"till the day of resurrection,"
4583,13,"for, bless my beard, they aye shall be"
4584,13,"my beloved trinity,"
4585,14,happy is england! i could be content
4586,14,to see no other verdure than its own;
4587,14,to feel no other breezes than are blown
4588,14,"through its tall woods with high romances blent,"
4589,14,yet do i sometimes feel a languishment
4590,14,"for skies italian, and an inward groan"
4591,14,"to sit upon an alp as on a throne,"
4592,14,"and half forget what world or worldling meant,"
4593,14,"happy is england, sweet her artless daughters;"
4594,14,"enough their simple loveliness for me,"
4595,14,"enough their whitest arms in silence clinging,"
4596,14,yet do i often warmly burn to see
4597,14,"beauties of deeper glance, and hear their singing,"
4598,14,"and float with them about the summer waters,"
4599,15,"bright star, would i were steadfast as thou art! -"
4600,15,"not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,"
4601,15,"and watching, with eternal lids apart,"
4602,15,"like nature's patient sleepless eremite,"
4603,15,the moving waters at their priestlike task
4604,15,"of pure ablution round earth's human shores,"
4605,15,or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
4606,15,of snow upon the mountains and the moors -
4607,15,"no -yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,"
4608,15,"pillowed upon my fair love's ripening breast,"
4609,15,"to feel for ever its soft fall and swell,"
4610,15,"awake for ever in a sweet unrest,"
4611,15,"still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,"
4612,15,"and so live ever -or else swoon to death,"
4613,16,"hither hither, love---"
4614,16,     'tis a shady mead---
4615,16,"hither, hither, love!"
4616,16,     let us feed and feed!
4617,16,
4618,16,"hither, hither, sweet---"
4619,16,     'tis a cowslip bed---
4620,16,"hither, hither, sweet!"
4621,16,     'tis with dew bespread!
4622,16,
4623,16,"hither, hither, dear"
4624,16,"     by the breath of life,"
4625,16,"hither, hither, dear!---"
4626,16,     be the summer's wife!
4627,16,
4628,16,though one moment's pleasure
4629,16,     in one moment flies---
4630,16,though the passion's treasure
4631,16,     in one moment dies;---
4632,16,
4633,16,yet it has not passed---
4634,16,"     think how near, how near!---"
4635,16,"and while it doth last,"
4636,16,"     think how dear, how dear!"
4637,16,
4638,16,"hither, hither, hither"
4639,16,     love its boon has sent---
4640,16,if i die and wither
4641,16,     i shall die content!
4642,17,how many bards gild the lapses of time!
4643,17,a few of them have ever been the food
4644,17,"of my delighted fancy,—i could brood"
4645,17,"over their beauties, earthly, or sublime,"
4646,17,"and often, when i sit me down to rhyme,"
4647,17,"these will in throngs before my mind intrude,"
4648,17,"but no confusion, no disturbance rude"
4649,17,"do they occasion; 'tis a pleasing chime,"
4650,17,so the unnumbered sounds that evening store;
4651,17,the songs of birds—the whispering of the leaves—
4652,17,the voice of waters—the great bell that heaves
4653,17,"with solemn sound,—and thousand others more,"
4654,17,"that distance of recognizance bereaves,"
4655,17,"makes pleasing music, and not wild uproar,"
4656,18,"god of the golden bow,"
4657,18,"     and of the golden lyre,"
4658,18,"and of the golden hair,"
4659,18,"     and of the golden fire,"
4660,18,           charioteer
4661,18,"           of the patient year,"
4662,18,"     where---where slept thine ire,"
4663,18,"when like a blank idiot i put on thy wreath,"
4664,18,"     thy laurel, thy glory,"
4665,18,"     the light of thy story,"
4666,18,or was i a worm---too low crawling for death?
4667,18,     o delphic apollo!
4668,18,
4669,18,"the thunderer grasp'd and grasp'd,"
4670,18,     the thunderer frown'd and frown'd;
4671,18,the eagle's feathery mane
4672,18,     for wrath became stiffen'd---the sound
4673,18,           of breeding thunder
4674,18,"           went drowsily under,"
4675,18,"     muttering to be unbound,"
4676,18,"o why didst thou pity, and beg for a worm?"
4677,18,     why touch thy soft lute
4678,18,"     till the thunder was mute,"
4679,18,why was i not crush'd---such a pitiful germ?
4680,18,     o delphic apollo!
4681,18,
4682,18,"the pleiades were up,"
4683,18,     watching the silent air;
4684,18,the seeds and roots in earth
4685,18,     were swelling for summer fare;
4686,18,"           the ocean, its neighbour,"
4687,18,"           was at his old labour,"
4688,18,"     when, who---who did dare"
4689,18,"to tie for a moment, thy plant round his brow,"
4690,18,"     and grin and look proudly,"
4691,18,"     and blaspheme so loudly,"
4692,18,"and live for that honour, to stoop to thee now?"
4693,18,     o delphic apollo!
4694,19,book i
4695,19,    deep in the shady sadness of a vale
4696,19,"far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,"
4697,19,"far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,"
4698,19,"sat gray-hair'd saturn, quiet as a stone,"
4699,19,still as the silence round about his lair;
4700,19,forest on forest hung above his head
4701,19,"like cloud on cloud, no stir of air was there,"
4702,19,not so much life as on a summer's day
4703,19,"robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,"
4704,19,"but where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest,"
4705,19,"a stream went voiceless by, still deadened more"
4706,19,by reason of his fallen divinity
4707,19,"spreading a shade, the naiad 'mid her reeds"
4708,19,"press'd her cold finger closer to her lips,"
4709,19,
4710,19,"    along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,"
4711,19,"no further than to where his feet had stray'd,"
4712,19,"and slept there since,  upon the sodden ground"
4713,19,"his old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,"
4714,19,unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;
4715,19,"while his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the earth,"
4716,19,"his ancient mother, for some comfort yet,"
4717,19,
4718,19,    it seem'd no force could wake him from his place;
4719,19,"but there came one, who with a kindred hand"
4720,19,"touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low"
4721,19,"with reverence, though to one who knew it not,"
4722,19,she was a goddess of the infant world;
4723,19,by her in stature the tall amazon
4724,19,"had stood a pigmy's height, she would have ta'en"
4725,19,achilles by the hair and bent his neck;
4726,19,"or with a finger stay'd ixion's wheel,"
4727,19,"her face was large as that of memphian sphinx,"
4728,19,"pedestal'd haply in a palace court,"
4729,19,"when sages look'd to egypt for their lore,"
4730,19,"but oh! how unlike marble was that face,"
4731,19,"how beautiful, if sorrow had not made"
4732,19,"sorrow more beautiful than beauty's self,"
4733,19,"there was a listening fear in her regard,"
4734,19,as if calamity had but begun;
4735,19,as if the vanward clouds of evil days
4736,19,"had spent their malice, and the sullen rear"
4737,19,"was with its stored thunder labouring up,"
4738,19,one hand she press'd upon that aching spot
4739,19,"where beats the human heart, as if just there,"
4740,19,"though an immortal, she felt cruel pain,"
4741,19,the other upon saturn's bended neck
4742,19,"she laid, and to the level of his ear"
4743,19,"leaning with parted lips, some words she spake"
4744,19,"in solemn tenor and deep organ tone,"
4745,19,"some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue"
4746,19,would come in these like accents; o how frail
4747,19,to that large utterance of the early gods!
4748,19,"saturn, look up!---though wherefore, poor old king?"
4749,19,"i have no comfort for thee, no not one,"
4750,19,"i cannot say, 'o wherefore sleepest thou?'"
4751,19,"for heaven is parted from thee, and the earth"
4752,19,"knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a god;"
4753,19,"and ocean too, with all its solemn noise,"
4754,19,has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air
4755,19,"is emptied of thine hoary majesty,"
4756,19,"thy thunder, conscious of the new command,"
4757,19,rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;
4758,19,and thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands
4759,19,"scorches and burns our once serene domain,"
4760,19,o aching time! o moments big as years!
4761,19,"all as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,"
4762,19,and press it so upon our weary griefs
4763,19,"that unbelief has not a space to breathe,"
4764,19,"saturn, sleep on,---o thoughtless, why did i"
4765,19,thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
4766,19,why should i ope thy melancholy eyes?
4767,19,"saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet i weep,"
4768,19,
4769,19,"    as when, upon a tranced summer-night,"
4770,19,"those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,"
4771,19,"tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,"
4772,19,"dream, and so dream all night without a stir,"
4773,19,save from one gradual solitary gust
4774,19,"which comes upon the silence, and dies off,"
4775,19,as if the ebbing air had but one wave;
4776,19,so came these words and went; the while in tears
4777,19,"she touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,"
4778,19,just where her fallen hair might be outspread
4779,19,"a soft and silken mat for saturn's feet,"
4780,19,"one moon, with alteration slow, had shed"
4781,19,"her silver seasons four upon the night,"
4782,19,"and still these two were postured motionless,"
4783,19,like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;
4784,19,"the frozen god still couchant on the earth,"
4785,19,"and the sad goddess weeping at his feet,"
4786,19,until at length old saturn lifted up
4787,19,"his faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,"
4788,19,"and all the gloom and sorrow ofthe place,"
4789,19,"and that fair kneeling goddess; and then spake,"
4790,19,"as with a palsied tongue, and while his beard"
4791,19,"shook horrid with such aspen-malady,"
4792,19,"o tender spouse of gold hyperion,"
4793,19,"thea, i feel thee ere i see thy face;"
4794,19,"look up, and let me see our doom in it;"
4795,19,"look up, and tell me if this feeble shape"
4796,19,"is saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice"
4797,19,"of saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,"
4798,19,"naked and bare of its great diadem,"
4799,19,peers like the front of saturn? who had power
4800,19,to make me desolate? whence came the strength?
4801,19,"how was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,"
4802,19,while fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?
4803,19,"but it is so; and i am smother'd up,"
4804,19,and buried from all godlike exercise
4805,19,"of influence benign on planets pale,"
4806,19,"of admonitions to the winds and seas,"
4807,19,"of peaceful sway above man's harvesting,"
4808,19,and all those acts which deity supreme
4809,19,"doth ease its heart of love in,---i am gone"
4810,19,"away from my own bosom, i have left"
4811,19,"my strong identity, my real self,"
4812,19,"somewhere between the throne, and where i sit"
4813,19,"here on this spot of earth, search, thea, search!"
4814,19,"open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round"
4815,19,"upon all space, space starr'd, and lorn of light;"
4816,19,space region'd with life-air; and barren void;
4817,19,"spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell,---"
4818,19,"search, thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest"
4819,19,"a certain shape or shadow, making way"
4820,19,with wings or chariot fierce to repossess
4821,19,"a heaven he lost erewhile, it must---it must"
4822,19,"be of ripe progress---saturn must be king,"
4823,19,"yes, there must be a golden victory;"
4824,19,"there must be gods thrown down, and trumpets blown"
4825,19,"of triumph calm, and hymns of festival"
4826,19,"upon the gold clouds metropolitan,"
4827,19,"voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir"
4828,19,of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be
4829,19,"beautiful things made new, for the surprise"
4830,19,"of the sky-children; i will give command,"
4831,19,thea! thea! thea! where is saturn?
4832,19,"this passion lifted him upon his feet,"
4833,19,"and made his hands to struggle in the air,"
4834,19,"his druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,"
4835,19,"his eyes to fever out, his voice to cease,"
4836,19,"he stood, and heard not thea's sobbing deep;"
4837,19,"a little time, and then again he snatch'd"
4838,19,"utterance thus,---but cannot i create?"
4839,19,cannot i form? cannot i fashion forth
4840,19,"another world, another universe,"
4841,19,to overbear and crumble this to nought?
4842,19,where is another chaos? where?---that word
4843,19,"found way unto olympus, and made quake"
4844,19,"the rebel three,---thea was startled up,"
4845,19,"and in her bearing was a sort of hope,"
4846,19,"as thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe,"
4847,19,
4848,19,"    this cheers our fallen house, come to our friends,"
4849,19,"o saturn! come away, and give them heart;"
4850,19,"i know the covert, for thence came i hither,"
4851,19,thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went
4852,19,"with backward footing through the shade a space,"
4853,19,"he follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way"
4854,19,"through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist"
4855,19,"which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest,"
4856,19,
4857,19,"    meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,"
4858,19,"more sorrow like to this, and such like woe,"
4859,19,"too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe,"
4860,19,"the titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,"
4861,19,"groan'd for the old allegiance once more,"
4862,19,"and listen'd in sharp pain for saturn's voice,"
4863,19,but one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept
4864,19,"his sov'reigny, and rule, and majesy;---"
4865,19,blazing hyperion on his orbed fire
4866,19,"still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up"
4867,19,"from man to the sun's god, yet unsecure,"
4868,19,for as among us mortals omens drear
4869,19,"fright and perplex, so also shuddered he---"
4870,19,"not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,"
4871,19,or the familiar visiting of one
4872,19,"upon the first toll of his passing-bell,"
4873,19,or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;
4874,19,"but horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,"
4875,19,"oft made hyperion ache,  his palace bright,"
4876,19,"bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,"
4877,19,"and touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,"
4878,19,"glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,"
4879,19,"arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;"
4880,19,and all its curtains of aurorian clouds
4881,19,"flush'd angerly, while sometimes eagles' wings,"
4882,19,"unseen before by gods or wondering men,"
4883,19,darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard
4884,19,"not heard before by gods or wondering men,"
4885,19,"also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths"
4886,19,"of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,"
4887,19,"instead of sweets, his ample palate took"
4888,19,"savor of poisonous brass and metal sick,"
4889,19,"and so, when harbor'd in the sleepy west,"
4890,19,"after the full completion of fair day,---"
4891,19,"for rest divine upon exalted couch,"
4892,19,"and slumber in the arms of melody,"
4893,19,he pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease
4894,19,"with stride colossal, on from hall to hall;"
4895,19,"while far within each aisle and deep recess,"
4896,19,"his winged minions in close clusters stood,"
4897,19,amaz'd and full offear; like anxious men
4898,19,"who on wide plains gather in panting troops,"
4899,19,"when earthquakes jar their battlements and towers,"
4900,19,"even now, while saturn, rous'd from icy trance,"
4901,19,"went step for step with thea through the woods,"
4902,19,"hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,"
4903,19,came slope upon the threshold of the west;
4904,19,"then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope"
4905,19,"in smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,"
4906,19,"blown by the serious zephyrs, gave of sweet"
4907,19,"and wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;"
4908,19,"and like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,"
4909,19,"in fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,"
4910,19,that inlet to severe magnificence
4911,19,"stood full blown, for the god to enter in,"
4912,19,
4913,19,"    he enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;"
4914,19,"his flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,"
4915,19,"and gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,"
4916,19,that scar'd away the meek ethereal hours
4917,19,"and made their dove-wings tremble, on he flared"
4918,19,"from stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,"
4919,19,"through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,"
4920,19,"and diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,"
4921,19,until he reach'd the great main cupola;
4922,19,"there standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,"
4923,19,and from the basements deep to the high towers
4924,19,jarr'd his own golden region; and before
4925,19,"the quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,"
4926,19,"his voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,"
4927,19,"to this result, o dreams of day and night!"
4928,19,o monstrous forms! o effigies of pain!
4929,19,"o spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!"
4930,19,o lank-eared phantoms of black-weeded pools!
4931,19,why do i know ye? why have i seen ye? why
4932,19,is my eternal essence thus distraught
4933,19,to see and to behold these horrors new?
4934,19,"saturn is fallen, am i too to fall?"
4935,19,"am i to leave this haven of my rest,"
4936,19,"this cradle of my glory, this soft clime,"
4937,19,"this calm luxuriance of blissful light,"
4938,19,"these crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,"
4939,19,of all my lucent empire?  it is left
4940,19,"deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine,"
4941,19,"the blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,"
4942,19,"i cannot see but darkness, death, and darkness,"
4943,19,"even here, into my centre of repose,"
4944,19,"the shady visions come to domineer,"
4945,19,"insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp,---"
4946,19,"fall!---no, by tellus and her briny robes!"
4947,19,over the fiery frontier of my realms
4948,19,i will advance a terrible right arm
4949,19,"shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel jove,"
4950,19,"and bid old saturn take his throne again,---"
4951,19,"he spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat"
4952,19,held struggle with his throat but came not forth;
4953,19,for as in theatres of crowded men
4954,19,hubbub increases more they call out hush!
4955,19,so at hyperion's words the phantoms pale
4956,19,"bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;"
4957,19,and from the mirror'd level where he stood
4958,19,"a mist arose, as from a scummy marsh,"
4959,19,"at this, through all his bulk an agony"
4960,19,"crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,"
4961,19,like a lithe serpent vast and muscular
4962,19,"making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd"
4963,19,"from over-strained might,  releas'd, he fled"
4964,19,"to the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours"
4965,19,"before the dawn in season due should blush,"
4966,19,"he breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,"
4967,19,"clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide"
4968,19,"suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams,"
4969,19,"the planet orb of fire, whereon he rode"
4970,19,"each day from east to west the heavens through,"
4971,19,spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;
4972,19,"not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,"
4973,19,"but ever and anon the glancing spheres,"
4974,19,"circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,"
4975,19,"glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark"
4976,19,sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep
4977,19,"up to the zenith,---hieroglyphics old,"
4978,19,which sages and keen-eyed astrologers
4979,19,"then living on the earth, with laboring thought"
4980,19,"won from the gaze of many centuries,"
4981,19,"now lost, save what we find on remnants huge"
4982,19,"of stone, or rnarble swart; their import gone,"
4983,19,"their wisdom long since fled,---two wings this orb"
4984,19,"possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,"
4985,19,"ever exalted at the god's approach,"
4986,19,"and now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense"
4987,19,"rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;"
4988,19,"while still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,"
4989,19,"awaiting for hyperion's command,"
4990,19,"fain would he have commanded, fain took throne"
4991,19,"and bid the day begin, if but for change,"
4992,19,"he might not,---no, though a primeval god,"
4993,19,"the sacred seasons might not be disturb'd,"
4994,19,therefore the operations of the dawn
4995,19,"stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told,"
4996,19,"those silver wings expanded sisterly,"
4997,19,eager to sail their orb; the porches wide
4998,19,open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night
4999,19,"and the bright titan, phrenzied with new woes,"
5000,19,"unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent"
5001,19,his spirit to the sorrow of the time;
5002,19,"and all along a dismal rack of clouds,"
5003,19,"upon the boundaries of day and night,"
5004,19,"he stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint,"
5005,19,"there as he lay, the heaven with its stars"
5006,19,"look'd down on him with pity, and the voice"
5007,19,"of coelus, from the universal space,"
5008,19,"thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear,"
5009,19,"o brightest of my children dear, earth-born"
5010,19,"and sky-engendered, son of mysteries"
5011,19,all unrevealed even to the powers
5012,19,which met at thy creating; at whose joys
5013,19,"and palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,"
5014,19,"i, coelus, wonder, how they came and whence;"
5015,19,"and at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,"
5016,19,"distinct, and visible; symbols divine,"
5017,19,manifestations of that beauteous life
5018,19,"diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space,"
5019,19,"of these new-form'd art thou, o brightest child!"
5020,19,"of these, thy brethren and the goddesses!"
5021,19,"there is sad feud among ye, and rebellion"
5022,19,"of son against his sire,  i saw him fall,"
5023,19,i saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!
5024,19,"to me his arms were spread, to me his voice"
5025,19,found way from forth the thunders round his head!
5026,19,"pale wox i, and in vapours hid my face,"
5027,19,"art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is,"
5028,19,"for i have seen my sons most unlike gods,"
5029,19,"divine ye were created, and divine"
5030,19,"in sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,"
5031,19,"unruffled, like high gods, ye liv'd and ruled,"
5032,19,"now i behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;"
5033,19,actions of rage and passion; even as
5034,19,"i see them, on the mortal world beneath,"
5035,19,"in men who die,---this is the grief, o son!"
5036,19,"sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!"
5037,19,"yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,"
5038,19,"as thou canst move about, an evident god;"
5039,19,and canst oppose to each malignant hour
5040,19,"ethereal presence,---i am but a voice;"
5041,19,"my life is but the life of winds and tides,"
5042,19,"no more than winds and tides can i avail,---"
5043,19,"but thou canst,---be thou therefore in the van"
5044,19,"of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb"
5045,19,"before the tense string murmur,---to the earth!"
5046,19,"for there thou wilt find saturn, and his woes,"
5047,19,"meantime i will keep watch on thy bright sun,"
5048,19,"and of thy seasons be a careful nurse,---"
5049,19,"ere half this region-whisper had come down,"
5050,19,"hyperion arose, and on the stars"
5051,19,"lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide"
5052,19,"until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide,"
5053,19,"and still they were the same bright, patient stars,"
5054,19,"then with a slow incline of his broad breast,"
5055,19,"like to a diver in the pearly seas,"
5056,19,"forward he stoop'd over the airy shore,"
5057,19,"and plung'd all noiseless into the deep night,"
5058,19,
5059,19,book ii
5060,19,just at the self-same beat of time's wide wings
5061,19,"hyperion slid into the rustled air,"
5062,19,and saturn gain'd with thea that sad place
5063,19,"where cybele and the bruised titans mourn'd,"
5064,19,it was a den where no insulting light
5065,19,could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans
5066,19,"they felt, but heard not, for the solid roar"
5067,19,"of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,"
5068,19,"pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where,"
5069,19,"crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd"
5070,19,"ever as if just rising from a sleep,"
5071,19,forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;
5072,19,and thus in thousand hugest phantasies
5073,19,"made a fit roofing to this nest of woe,"
5074,19,"instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,"
5075,19,"couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge"
5076,19,"stubborn'd with iron,  all were not assembled,"
5077,19,"some chain'd in torture, and some wandering,"
5078,19,"caus, and gyges, and briareus,"
5079,19,"typhon, and dolor, and porphyrion,"
5080,19,"with many more, the brawniest in assault,"
5081,19,were pent in regions of laborious breath;
5082,19,"dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep"
5083,19,"their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs"
5084,19,"lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;"
5085,19,"without a motion, save of their big hearts"
5086,19,"heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd"
5087,19,"with sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse,"
5088,19,mnemosyne was straying in the world;
5089,19,far from her moon had phoebe wandered;
5090,19,"and many else were free to roam abroad,"
5091,19,"but for the main, here found they covert drear,"
5092,19,"scarce images of life, one here, one there,"
5093,19,lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque
5094,19,"of druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,"
5095,19,"when the chill rain begins at shut of eve,"
5096,19,"in dull november, and their chancel vault,"
5097,19,"the heaven itself, is blinded throughout night,"
5098,19,"each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave"
5099,19,"or word, or look, or action of despair,"
5100,19,creus was one; his ponderous iron mace
5101,19,"lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock"
5102,19,"told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined,"
5103,19,"iapetus another; in his grasp,"
5104,19,a serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue
5105,19,"squeez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length"
5106,19,"dead, and because the creature could not spit"
5107,19,"its poison in the eyes of conquering jove,"
5108,19,"next cottus, prone he lay, chin uppermost,"
5109,19,as though in pain; for still upon the flint
5110,19,"he ground severe his skull, with open mouth"
5111,19,"and eyes at horrid working,  nearest him"
5112,19,"asia, born of most enormous caf,"
5113,19,"who cost her mother tellus keener pangs,"
5114,19,"though feminine, than any of her sons,"
5115,19,"more thought than woe was in her dusky face,"
5116,19,for she was prophesying of her glory;
5117,19,and in her wide imagination stood
5118,19,"palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes"
5119,19,"by oxus or in ganges' sacred isles,"
5120,19,"even as hope upon her anchor leans,"
5121,19,"so leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk"
5122,19,"shed from the broadest of her elephants,"
5123,19,"above her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,"
5124,19,"upon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,"
5125,19,shadow'd enceladus; once tame and mild
5126,19,as grazing ox unworried in the meads;
5127,19,"now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,"
5128,19,"he meditated, plotted, and even now"
5129,19,"was hurling mountains in that second war,"
5130,19,"not long delay'd, that scar'd the younger gods"
5131,19,"to hide themselves in forms of beast and bird,"
5132,19,not far hence atlas; and beside him prone
5133,19,"phorcus, the sire of gorgons,  neighbour'd close"
5134,19,"oceanus, and tethys, in whose lap"
5135,19,"sobb'd clymene among her tangled hair,"
5136,19,"in midst of all lay themis, at the feet"
5137,19,"of ops the queen; all clouded round from sight,"
5138,19,"no shape distinguishable, more than when"
5139,19,"thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds,"
5140,19,"and many else whose names may not be told,"
5141,19,"for when the muse's wings are air-ward spread,"
5142,19,who shall delay her flight? and she must chaunt
5143,19,"of saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd"
5144,19,with damp and slippery footing from a depth
5145,19,"more horrid still, above a sombre cliff"
5146,19,"their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew"
5147,19,"till on the level height their steps found ease,"
5148,19,then thea spread abroad her trembling arms
5149,19,"upon the precincts of this nest of pain,"
5150,19,"and sidelong fix'd her eye on saturn's face,"
5151,19,there saw she direst strife; the supreme god
5152,19,"at war with all the frailty of grief,"
5153,19,"of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,"
5154,19,"remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair,"
5155,19,against these plagues he strove in vain; for fate
5156,19,"had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,"
5157,19,"a disanointing poison, so that thea,"
5158,19,"affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass"
5159,19,"first onwards in, among the fallen tribe,"
5160,19,
5161,19,"    as with us mortal men, the laden heart"
5162,19,"is persecuted more, and fever'd more,"
5163,19,when it is nighing to the mournful house
5164,19,where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;
5165,19,"so saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,"
5166,19,"felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,"
5167,19,"but that he met enceladus's eye,"
5168,19,"whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once"
5169,19,"came like an inspiration; and he shouted,"
5170,19,"titans, behold your god! at which some groan'd;"
5171,19,some started on their feet; some also shouted;
5172,19,"some wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;"
5173,19,"and ops, uplifting her black folded veil,"
5174,19,"show'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,"
5175,19,"her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes,"
5176,19,there is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines
5177,19,when winter lifts his voice; there is a noise
5178,19,"among immortals when a god gives sign,"
5179,19,"with hushing finger, how he means to load"
5180,19,"his tongue with the filll weight of utterless thought,"
5181,19,"with thunder, and with music, and with pomp,"
5182,19,such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;
5183,19,"which, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,"
5184,19,"no other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,"
5185,19,"among these fallen, saturn's voice therefrom"
5186,19,"grew up like organ, that begins anew"
5187,19,"its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,"
5188,19,"leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly,"
5189,19,"thus grew it up---not in my own sad breast,"
5190,19,"which is its own great judge and searcher out,"
5191,19,"can i find reason why ye should be thus,"
5192,19,"not in the legends of the first of days,"
5193,19,studied from that old spirit-leaved book
5194,19,which starry uranus with finger bright
5195,19,"sav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves"
5196,19,low-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;---
5197,19,and the which book ye know i ever kept
5198,19,"for my firm-based footstool,---ah, infirm!"
5199,19,"not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent"
5200,19,"of element, earth, water, air, and fire,---"
5201,19,"at war, at peace, or inter-quarreling"
5202,19,"one against one, or two, or three, or all"
5203,19,"each several one against the other three,"
5204,19,as fire with air loud warring when rain-floods
5205,19,"drown both, and press them both against earth's face,"
5206,19,"where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath"
5207,19,"unhinges the poor world;---not in that strife,"
5208,19,"wherefrom i take strange lore, and read it deep,"
5209,19,"can i find reason why ye should be thus,"
5210,19,"no, nowhere can unriddle, though i search,"
5211,19,and pore on nature's universal scroll
5212,19,"even to swooning, why ye, divinities,"
5213,19,"the first-born of all shap'd and palpable gods,"
5214,19,"should cower beneath what, in comparison,"
5215,19,"is untremendous might, yet ye are here,"
5216,19,"o'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!"
5217,19,"o titans, shall i say 'arise!'---ye groan,"
5218,19,"shall i say 'crouch!'---ye groan, what can i then?"
5219,19,o heaven wide! o unseen parent dear!
5220,19,"what can i? tell me, all ye brethren gods,"
5221,19,"how we can war, how engine our great wrath!"
5222,19,"o speak your counsel now, for saturn's ear"
5223,19,"is all a-hunger'd, thou, oceanus,"
5224,19,ponderest high and deep; and in thy face
5225,19,"i see, astonied, that severe content"
5226,19,"which comes of thought and musing, give us help!"
5227,19,
5228,19,"    so ended saturn; and the god of the sea,"
5229,19,"sophist and sage, from no athenian grove,"
5230,19,"but cogitation in his watery shades,"
5231,19,"arose, with locks not oozy, and began,"
5232,19,"in murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue"
5233,19,"caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands,"
5234,19,"o ye, whom wrath consumes!  who, passion-stung,"
5235,19,"writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!"
5236,19,"shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,"
5237,19,"my voice is not a bellows unto ire,"
5238,19,"yet listen, ye who will, whilst i bring proof"
5239,19,"how ye, perforce, must be content to stoop,"
5240,19,"and in the proof much comfort will i give,"
5241,19,"if ye will take that comfort in its truth,"
5242,19,"we fall by course of nature's law, not force"
5243,19,"of thunder, or of jove, great saturn, thou"
5244,19,hast sifted well the atom-universe;
5245,19,"but for this reason, that thou art the king,"
5246,19,"and only blind from sheer supremacy,"
5247,19,"one avenue was shaded from thine eyes,"
5248,19,"through which i wandered to eternal truth,"
5249,19,"and first, as thou wast not the first of powers,"
5250,19,"so art thou not the last; it cannot be,"
5251,19,"thou art not the beginning nor the end,"
5252,19,from chaos and parental darkness came
5253,19,"light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,"
5254,19,"that sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends"
5255,19,"was ripening in itself,  the ripe hour came,"
5256,19,"and with it light, and light, engendering"
5257,19,"upon its own producer, forthwith touch'd"
5258,19,"the whole enormous matter into life,"
5259,19,"upon that very hour, our parentage,"
5260,19,"the heavens and the earth, were manifest,"
5261,19,"then thou first born, and we the giant race,"
5262,19,"found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms,"
5263,19,"now comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;"
5264,19,"o folly! for to bear all naked truths,"
5265,19,"and to envisage circumstance, all calm,"
5266,19,"that is the top of sovereignty,  mark well!"
5267,19,"as heaven and earth are fairer, fairer far"
5268,19,"than chaos and blank darkness, though once chiefs;"
5269,19,and as we show beyond that heaven and earth
5270,19,"in form and shape compact and beautiful,"
5271,19,"in will, in action free, companionship,"
5272,19,and thousand other signs of purer life;
5273,19,"so on our heels a fresh perfection treads,"
5274,19,"a power more strong in beauty, born of us"
5275,19,"and fated to excel us, as we pass"
5276,19,"in glory that old darkness, nor are we"
5277,19,"thereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule"
5278,19,"of shapeless chaos, say, doth the dull soil"
5279,19,"quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,"
5280,19,"and feedeth still, more comely than itself?"
5281,19,can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?
5282,19,or shall the tree be envious of the dove
5283,19,"because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings"
5284,19,to wander wherewithal and find its joys?
5285,19,"we are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs"
5286,19,"have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,"
5287,19,"but eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower"
5288,19,"above us in their beauty, and must reign"
5289,19,in right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law
5290,19,"that first in beauty should be first in might,"
5291,19,"yea, by that law, another race may drive"
5292,19,"our conquerors to mourn as we do now,"
5293,19,"have ye beheld the young god of the seas,"
5294,19,my dispossessor? have ye seen his face?
5295,19,"have ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along"
5296,19,by noble winged creatures he hath made?
5297,19,"i saw him on the calmed waters scud,"
5298,19,"with such a glow of beauty in his eyes,"
5299,19,that it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell
5300,19,"to all my empire, farewell sad i took,"
5301,19,"and hither came, to see how dolorous fate"
5302,19,had wrought upon ye; and how i might best
5303,19,"give consolation in this woe extreme,"
5304,19,"receive the truth, and let it be your balm,"
5305,19,
5306,19,"    whether through pos'd conviction, or disdain,"
5307,19,"they guarded silence, when oceanus"
5308,19,"left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?"
5309,19,"but so it was, none answer'd for a space,"
5310,19,"save one whom none regarded, clymene;"
5311,19,"and yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,"
5312,19,"with hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,"
5313,19,"thus wording timidly among the fierce,"
5314,19,"o father! i am here the simplest voice,"
5315,19,"and all my knowledge is that joy is gone,"
5316,19,"and this thing woe crept in among our hearts,"
5317,19,"there to remain for ever, as i fear,"
5318,19,"i would not bode of evil, if i thought"
5319,19,so weak a creature could turn off the help
5320,19,which by just right should come of mighty gods;
5321,19,"yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell"
5322,19,"of what i heard, and how it made me weep,"
5323,19,"and know that we had parted from all hope,"
5324,19,"i stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,"
5325,19,where a sweet clime was breathed from a land
5326,19,"of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers,"
5327,19,"full of calm joy it was, as i of grief;"
5328,19,too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;
5329,19,so that i felt a movement in my heart
5330,19,"to chide, and to reproach that solitude"
5331,19,"with songs of misery, music of our woes;"
5332,19,"and sat me down, and took a mouthed shell"
5333,19,"and murmur'd into it, and made melody---"
5334,19,"o melody no more! for while i sang,"
5335,19,and with poor skill let pass into the breeze
5336,19,"the dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand"
5337,19,"just opposite, an island of the sea,"
5338,19,"there came enchantment with the shifting wind,"
5339,19,"that did both drown and keep alive my ears,"
5340,19,"i threw my shell away upon the sand,"
5341,19,"and a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd"
5342,19,"with that new blissful golden melody,"
5343,19,"a living death was in each gush of sounds,"
5344,19,"each family of rapturous hurried notes,"
5345,19,"that fell, one after one, yet all at once,"
5346,19,"like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string,"
5347,19,"and then another, then another strain,"
5348,19,"each like a dove leaving its olive perch,"
5349,19,"with music wing'd instead of silent plumes,"
5350,19,"to hover round my head, and make me sick"
5351,19,"of joy and grief at once,  grief overcame,"
5352,19,"and i was stopping up my frantic ears,"
5353,19,"when, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,"
5354,19,"a voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,"
5355,19,"and still it cried, 'apollo! young apollo!"
5356,19,the morning-bright apollo! young apollo!'
5357,19,"i fled, it follow'd me, and cried 'apollo!'"
5358,19,"o father, and o brethren, had ye felt"
5359,19,"those pains of mine; o saturn, hadst thou felt,"
5360,19,ye would not call this too indulged tongue
5361,19,"presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard,"
5362,19,
5363,19,"    so far her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook"
5364,19,"that, lingering along a pebbled coast,"
5365,19,"doth fear to meet the sea, but sea it met,"
5366,19,and shudder'd; for the overwhelming voice
5367,19,"of huge enceladus swallow'd it in wrath,"
5368,19,"the ponderous syllables, like sullen waves"
5369,19,"in the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,"
5370,19,"came booming thus, while still upon his arm"
5371,19,"he lean'd; not rising, from supreme contempt,"
5372,19,"or shall we listen to the over-wise,"
5373,19,"or to the over-foolish, giant-gods?"
5374,19,"not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all"
5375,19,"that rebel jove's whole armoury were spent,"
5376,19,"not world on world upon these shoulders piled,"
5377,19,could agonize me more than baby-words
5378,19,"in midst of this dethronement horrible,"
5379,19,"speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy titans all,"
5380,19,"do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?"
5381,19,are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?
5382,19,"dost thou forget, sham monarch of the waves,"
5383,19,thy scalding in the seas?  what! have i rous'd
5384,19,your spleens with so few simple words as these?
5385,19,"o joy! for now i see ye are not lost,"
5386,19,o joy! for now i see a thousand eyes
5387,19,"wide-glaring for revenge!---as this he said,"
5388,19,"he lifted up his stature vast, and stood,"
5389,19,"still without intermission speaking thus,"
5390,19,"now ye are flames, i'll tell you how to burn,"
5391,19,and purge the ether of our enemies;
5392,19,"how to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,"
5393,19,"and singe away the swollen clouds of jove,"
5394,19,"stifling that puny essence in its tent,"
5395,19,o let him feel the evil he hath done;
5396,19,"for though i scorn oceanus's lore,"
5397,19,"much pain have i for more than loss of realms,"
5398,19,the days of peace and slumbrous calm are fled;
5399,19,"those days, all innocent of scathing war,"
5400,19,when all the fair existences of heaven
5401,19,"carne open-eyed to guess what we would speak,---"
5402,19,"that was before our brows were taught to frown,"
5403,19,before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;
5404,19,"that was before we knew the winged thing,"
5405,19,"victory, might be lost, or might be won,"
5406,19,"and be ye mindful that hyperion,"
5407,19,"our brightest brother, still is undisgraced---"
5408,19,"hyperion, lo! his radiance is here!"
5409,19,
5410,19,"    all eyes were on enceladus's face,"
5411,19,"and they beheld, while still hyperion's name"
5412,19,"flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,"
5413,19,"a pallid gleam across his features stern,"
5414,19,"not savage, for he saw full many a god"
5415,19,"wroth as himself,  he look'd upon them all,"
5416,19,"and in each face he saw a gleam of light,"
5417,19,"but splendider in saturn's, whose hoar locks"
5418,19,shone like the bubbling foam about a keel
5419,19,"when the prow sweeps into a midnight cove,"
5420,19,"in pale and silver silence they remain'd,"
5421,19,"till suddenly a splendor, like the morn,"
5422,19,"pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,"
5423,19,"all the sad spaces of oblivion,"
5424,19,"and every gulf, and every chasm old,"
5425,19,"and every height, and every sullen depth,"
5426,19,"voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams,"
5427,19,"and all the everlasting cataracts,"
5428,19,"and all the headlong torrents far and near,"
5429,19,"mantled before in darkness and huge shade,"
5430,19,"now saw the light and made it terrible,"
5431,19,"it was hyperion,---a granite peak"
5432,19,"his bright feet touch'd, and there he stay'd to view"
5433,19,the misery his brilliance had betray'd
5434,19,"to the most hateful seeing of itself,"
5435,19,"golden his hair of short numidian curl,"
5436,19,"regal his shape majestic, a vast shade"
5437,19,"in midst of his own brightness, like the bulk"
5438,19,of memnon's image at the set of sun
5439,19,"to one who travels from the dusking east,"
5440,19,"sighs, too, as mournful as that memnon's harp"
5441,19,"he utter'd, while his hands contemplative"
5442,19,"he press'd together, and in silence stood,"
5443,19,despondence seiz'd again the fallen gods
5444,19,"at sight of the dejected king of day,"
5445,19,"and many hid their faces from the light,"
5446,19,but fierce enceladus sent forth his eyes
5447,19,"among the brotherhood; and, at their glare,"
5448,19,"uprose iapetus, and creus too,"
5449,19,"and phorcus, sea-born, and together strode"
5450,19,"to where he towered on his eminence,"
5451,19,there those four shouted forth old saturn's name;
5452,19,"hyperion from the peak loud answered, saturn!"
5453,19,"saturn sat near the mother of the gods,"
5454,19,"in whose face was no joy, though all the gods"
5455,19,gave from their hollow throats the name of saturn!
5456,19,
5457,19,book iii
5458,19,"thus in altemate uproar and sad peace,"
5459,19,"amazed were those titans utterly,"
5460,19,"o leave them, muse!  o leave them to their woes;"
5461,19,"for thou art weak to sing such tumults dire,"
5462,19,a solitary sorrow best befits
5463,19,"thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief,"
5464,19,"leave them, o muse! for thou anon wilt find"
5465,19,many a fallen old divinity
5466,19,"wandering in vain about bewildered shores,"
5467,19,"meantime touch piously the delphic harp,"
5468,19,and not a wind of heaven but will breathe
5469,19,in aid soft warble from the dorian flute;
5470,19,"for lo! 'tis for the father of all verse,"
5471,19,"flush everything that hath a vermeil hue,"
5472,19,"let the rose glow intense and warm the air,"
5473,19,and let the clouds of even and of morn
5474,19,float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the hills;
5475,19,"let the red wine within the goblet boil,"
5476,19,"cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp'd shells,"
5477,19,"on sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn"
5478,19,through all their labyrinths; and let the maid
5479,19,"blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris'd,"
5480,19,"chief isle of the embowered cyclades,"
5481,19,"rejoice, o delos, with thine olives green,"
5482,19,"and poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,"
5483,19,"in which the zephyr breathes the loudest song,"
5484,19,"and hazels thick, dark-stemm'd beneath the shade,"
5485,19,apollo is once more the golden theme!
5486,19,"where was he, when the giant of the sun"
5487,19,"stood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers?"
5488,19,together had he left his mother fair
5489,19,"and his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,"
5490,19,and in the morning twilight wandered forth
5491,19,"beside the osiers of a rivulet,"
5492,19,"full ankle-deep in lilies of the vale,"
5493,19,"the nightingale had ceas'd, and a few stars"
5494,19,"were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush"
5495,19,"began calm-throated,  throughout all the isle"
5496,19,"there was no covert, no retired cave,"
5497,19,"unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,"
5498,19,"though scarcely heard in many a green recess,"
5499,19,"he listen'd, and he wept, and his bright tears"
5500,19,"went trickling down the golden bow he held,"
5501,19,"thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,"
5502,19,while from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by
5503,19,"with solemn step an awful goddess came,"
5504,19,"and there was purport in her looks for him,"
5505,19,which he with eager guess began to read
5506,19,"perplex'd, the while melodiously he said,"
5507,19,how cam'st thou over the unfooted sea?
5508,19,or hath that antique mien and robed form
5509,19,mov'd in these vales invisible till now?
5510,19,sure i have heard those vestments sweeping o'er
5511,19,"the fallen leaves, when i have sat alone"
5512,19,"in cool mid-forest,  surely i have traced"
5513,19,the rustle of those ample skirts about
5514,19,"these grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers"
5515,19,"lift up their heads, as still the whisper pass'd,"
5516,19,"goddess! i have beheld those eyes before,"
5517,19,"and their eternal calm, and all that face,"
5518,19,"or i have dream'd,---yes, said the supreme shape,"
5519,19,thou hast dream'd of me; and awaking up
5520,19,"didst find a lyre all golden by thy side,"
5521,19,"whose strings touch'd by thy fingers, all the vast"
5522,19,unwearied ear of the whole universe
5523,19,listen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth
5524,19,"of such new tuneful wonder, is't not strange"
5525,19,"that thou shouldst weep, so gifted? tell me, youth,"
5526,19,what sorrow thou canst feel; for i am sad
5527,19,"when thou dost shed a tear, explain thy griefs"
5528,19,to one who in this lonely isle hath been
5529,19,"the watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,"
5530,19,from the young day when first thy infant hand
5531,19,"pluck'd witless the weak flowers, till thine arm"
5532,19,"could bend that bow heroic to all times,"
5533,19,show thy heart's secret to an ancient power
5534,19,who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones
5535,19,"for prophecies of thee, and for the sake"
5536,19,"of loveliness new born,---apollo then,"
5537,19,"with sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes,"
5538,19,"thus answer'd, while his white melodious throat"
5539,19,"throbb'd with the syllables,---mnemosyne!"
5540,19,"thy name is on my tongue, i know not how;"
5541,19,why should i tell thee what thou so well seest?
5542,19,why should i strive to show what from thy lips
5543,19,"would come no mystery? for me, dark, dark,"
5544,19,"and painful vile oblivion seals my eyes,"
5545,19,"i strive to search wherefore i am so sad,"
5546,19,until a melancholy numbs my limbs;
5547,19,"and then upon the grass i sit, and moan,"
5548,19,"like one who once had wings,---o why should i"
5549,19,"feel curs'd and thwarted, when the liegeless air"
5550,19,yields to my step aspirant? why should i
5551,19,spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?
5552,19,"goddess benign, point forth some unknown thing,"
5553,19,are there not other regions than this isle?
5554,19,"what are the stars? there is the sun, the sun!"
5555,19,and the most patient brilliance of the moon!
5556,19,and stars by thousands!  point me out the way
5557,19,"to any one particular beauteous star,"
5558,19,"and i will flit into it with my lyre,"
5559,19,"and make its silvery splendor pant with bliss,"
5560,19,"i have heard the cloudy thunder, where is power?"
5561,19,"whose hand, whose essence, what divinity"
5562,19,"makes this alarum in the elements,"
5563,19,while i here idle listen on the shores
5564,19,in fearless yet in aching ignorance?
5565,19,"o tell me, lonely goddess, by thy harp,"
5566,19,"that waileth every morn and eventide,"
5567,19,tell me why thus i rave about these groves!
5568,19,mute thou remainest---mute! yet i can read
5569,19,"a wondrous lesson in thy silent face,"
5570,19,"knowledge enormous makes a god of me,"
5571,19,"names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,"
5572,19,"majesties, sovran voices, agonies,"
5573,19,"creations and destroyings, all at once"
5574,19,"pour into the wide hollows of my brain,"
5575,19,"and deify me, as if some blithe wine"
5576,19,"or bright elixir peerless i had drunk,"
5577,19,"and so become immortal,---thus the god,"
5578,19,"while his enkindled eyes, with level glance"
5579,19,"beneath his white soft temples, steadfast kept"
5580,19,"trembling with light upon mnemosyne,"
5581,19,"soon wild commotions shook him, and made flush"
5582,19,all the immortal fairness of his limbs;
5583,19,most like the struggle at the gate of death;
5584,19,or liker still to one who should take leave
5585,19,"of pale immortal death, and with a pang"
5586,19,"as hot as death's is chill, with fierce convulse"
5587,19,"die into life, so young apollo anguish'd,"
5588,19,"his very hair, his golden tresses famed,"
5589,19,"kept undulation round his eager neck,"
5590,19,during the pain mnemosyne upheld
5591,19,"her arms as one who prophesied, at length"
5592,19,apollo shriek'd;---and lo! from all his limbs
5593,19,celestial
5594,20,"i stood tip-toe upon a little hill,  "
5595,20,"the air was cooling, and so very still,  "
5596,20,that the sweet buds which with a modest pride  
5597,20,"pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,  "
5598,20,"their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems,        "
5599,20,had not yet lost those starry diadems  
5600,20,"caught from the early sobbing of the morn,  "
5601,20,"the clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,  "
5602,20,and fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept  
5603,20,"on the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept          "
5604,20,"a little noiseless noise among the leaves,  "
5605,20,"born of the very sigh that silence heaves,  "
5606,20,for not the faintest motion could be seen  
5607,20,"of all the shades that slanted o’er the green,  "
5608,20,"there was wide wand’ring for the greediest eye,          "
5609,20,to peer about upon variety;  
5610,20,"far round the horizon’s crystal air to skim,  "
5611,20,and trace the dwindled edgings of its brim;  
5612,20,"to picture out the quaint, and curious bending  "
5613,20,"of a fresh woodland alley, never ending;        "
5614,20,"or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves,  "
5615,20,"guess where the jaunty streams refresh themselves,  "
5616,20,"i gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free  "
5617,20,as though the fanning wings of mercury  
5618,20,"had played upon my heels, i was light-hearted,          "
5619,20,and many pleasures to my vision started;  
5620,20,so i straightway began to pluck a posey  
5621,20,"of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy,  "
5622,20,
5623,20,a bush of may flowers with the bees about them;  
5624,20,"ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them;          "
5625,20,"and let a lush laburnum oversweep them,  "
5626,20,and let long grass grow round the roots to keep them  
5627,20,"moist, cool and green; and shade the violets,  "
5628,20,"that they may bind the moss in leafy nets,  "
5629,20,
5630,20,"a filbert hedge with wildbriar overtwined,          "
5631,20,and clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind  
5632,20,upon their summer thrones; there too should be  
5633,20,"the frequent chequer of a youngling tree,  "
5634,20,that with a score of light green breth[r]en shoots  
5635,20,"from the quaint mossiness of aged roots,        "
5636,20,round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters  
5637,20,babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters  
5638,20,"the spreading blue bells, it may haply mourn  "
5639,20,that such fair clusters should be rudely torn  
5640,20,"from their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly          "
5641,20,"by infant hands, left on the path to die,  "
5642,20,
5643,20,"open afresh your round of starry folds,  "
5644,20,ye ardent marigolds!  
5645,20,"dry up the moisture from your golden lids,  "
5646,20,for great apollo bids          
5647,20,that in these days your praises should be sung  
5648,20,"on many harps, which he has lately strung;  "
5649,20,"and when again your dewiness he kisses,  "
5650,20,"tell him, i have you in my world of blisses,  "
5651,20,"so haply when i rove in some far vale,          "
5652,20,"his mighty voice may come upon the gale,  "
5653,20,
5654,20,"here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight,  "
5655,20,"with wings of gentle flush o’er delicate white,  "
5656,20,"and taper fingers catching at all things,  "
5657,20,"to bind them all about with tiny rings,        "
5658,20,
5659,20,linger awhile upon some bending planks  
5660,20,"that lean against a streamlet’s rushy banks,  "
5661,20,"and watch intently nature’s gentle doings,  "
5662,20,"they will be found softer than ring-dove’s cooings,  "
5663,20,how silent comes the water round that bend;          
5664,20,not the minutest whisper does it send  
5665,20,"to the o’erhanging sallows, blades of grass  "
5666,20,"slowly across the chequer’d shadows pass,  "
5667,20,"why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach  "
5668,20,to where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach          
5669,20,a natural sermon o’er their pebbly beds;  
5670,20,"where swarms of minnows show their little heads,  "
5671,20,"staying their wavy bodies ’gainst the streams,  "
5672,20,to taste the luxury of sunny beams  
5673,20,"temper’d with coolness, how they ever wrestle          "
5674,20,"with their own sweet delight, and ever nestle  "
5675,20,"their silver bellies on the pebbly sand,  "
5676,20,"if you but scantily hold out the hand,  "
5677,20,that very instant not one will remain;  
5678,20,"but turn your eye, and they are there again,          "
5679,20,"the ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,  "
5680,20,and cool themselves among the em’rald tresses;  
5681,20,"the while they cool themselves, they freshness give,  "
5682,20,"and moisture, that the bowery green may live,  "
5683,20,"so keeping up an interchange of favours,          "
5684,20,"like good men in the truth of their behaviours,  "
5685,20,sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop  
5686,20,from low hung branches; little space they stop;  
5687,20,"but sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek;  "
5688,20,"then off at once, as in a wanton freak,          "
5689,20,"or perhaps, to show their black, and golden wings  "
5690,20,"pausing upon their yellow flutterings,  "
5691,20,"were i in such a place, i sure should pray  "
5692,20,"that nought less sweet, might call my thoughts away,  "
5693,20,than the soft rustle of a maiden’s gown          
5694,20,fanning away the dandelion’s down;  
5695,20,than the light music of her nimble toes  
5696,20,"patting against the sorrel as she goes,  "
5697,20,"how she would start, and blush, thus to be caught  "
5698,20,"playing in all her innocence of thought,          "
5699,20,"o let me lead her gently o’er the brook,  "
5700,20,"watch her half-smiling lips, and downward look;  "
5701,20,o let me for one moment touch her wrist;  
5702,20,let me one moment to her breathing list;  
5703,20,and as she leaves me may she often turn          
5704,20,"her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne,  "
5705,20,"what next? a tuft of evening primroses,  "
5706,20,o’er which the mind may hover till it dozes;  
5707,20,"o’er which it well might take a pleasant sleep,  "
5708,20,but that ’tis ever startled by the leap          
5709,20,of buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting  
5710,20,"of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting;  "
5711,20,or by the moon lifting her silver rim  
5712,20,"above a cloud, and with a gradual swim  "
5713,20,"coming into the blue with all her light,          "
5714,20,"o maker of sweet poets, dear delight  "
5715,20,"of this fair world, and all its gentle livers;  "
5716,20,"spangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers,  "
5717,20,"mingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams,  "
5718,20,"closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams,          "
5719,20,"lover of loneliness, and wandering,  "
5720,20,"of upcast eye, and tender pondering!  "
5721,20,thee must i praise above all other glories  
5722,20,"that smile us on to tell delightful stories,  "
5723,20,for what has made the sage or poet write          
5724,20,but the fair paradise of nature’s light?  
5725,20,"in the calm grandeur of a sober line,  "
5726,20,we see the waving of the mountain pine;  
5727,20,"and when a tale is beautifully staid,  "
5728,20,"we feel the safety of a hawthorn glade,        "
5729,20,"when it is moving on luxurious wings,  "
5730,20,"the soul is lost in pleasant smotherings,  "
5731,20,"fair dewy roses brush against our faces,  "
5732,20,and flowering laurels spring from diamond vases;  
5733,20,"o’erhead we see the jasmine and sweet briar,        "
5734,20,and bloomy grapes laughing from green attire;  
5735,20,"while at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles  "
5736,20,"charms us at once away from all our troubles,  "
5737,20,"so that we feel uplifted from the world,  "
5738,20,"walking upon the white clouds wreath’d and curl’d,          "
5739,20,"so felt he, who first told, how psyche went  "
5740,20,on the smooth wind to realms of wonderment;  
5741,20,"what psyche felt, and love, when their full lips  "
5742,20,first touch’d; what amorous and fondling nips  
5743,20,"they gave each other’s cheeks; with all their sighs,        "
5744,20,"and how they kist each other’s tremulous eyes,  "
5745,20,"the silver lamp,—the ravishment,—the wonder—  "
5746,20,"the darkness,—loneliness,—the fearful thunder;  "
5747,20,"their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown,  "
5748,20,"to bow for gratitude before jove’s throne,        "
5749,20,
5750,20,"so did he feel, who pull’d the boughs aside,  "
5751,20,"that we might look into a forest wide,  "
5752,20,"to catch a glimpse of fawns, and dryades  "
5753,20,coming with softest rustle through the trees;  
5754,20,"and garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet,          "
5755,20,"upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet,  "
5756,20,"telling us how fair, trembling syrinx fled  "
5757,20,"arcadian pan, with such a fearful dread,  "
5758,20,"poor nymph,—poor pan,—how did he weep to find,  "
5759,20,nought but a lovely sighing of the wind          
5760,20,"along the reedy stream; a half heard strain,  "
5761,20,"full of sweet desolation—balmy pain,  "
5762,20,
5763,20,what first inspired a bard of old to sing  
5764,20,narcissus pining o’er the untainted spring?  
5765,20,"in some delicious ramble, he had found        "
5766,20,"a little space, with boughs all woven round;  "
5767,20,"and in the midst of all, a clearer pool  "
5768,20,"than e’er reflected in its pleasant cool,  "
5769,20,"the blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping  "
5770,20,"through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping,        "
5771,20,"and on the bank a lonely flower he spied,  "
5772,20,"a meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride,  "
5773,20,"drooping its beauty o’er the watery clearness,  "
5774,20,"to woo its own sad image into nearness,  "
5775,20,deaf to light zephyrus it would not move;          
5776,20,"but still would seem to droop, to pine, to love,  "
5777,20,"so while the poet stood in this sweet spot,  "
5778,20,some fainter gleamings o’er his fancy shot;  
5779,20,nor was it long ere he had told the tale  
5780,20,"of young narcissus, and sad echo’s bale,        "
5781,20,
5782,20,"where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew  "
5783,20,"that sweetest of all songs, that ever new,  "
5784,20,"that aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,  "
5785,20,coming ever to bless  
5786,20,the wanderer by moonlight? to him bringing          
5787,20,"shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing  "
5788,20,"from out the middle air, from flowery nests,  "
5789,20,and from the pillowy silkiness that rests  
5790,20,"full in the speculation of the stars,  "
5791,20,ah! surely he had burst our mortal bars;        
5792,20,"into some wond’rous region he had gone,  "
5793,20,"to search for thee, divine endymion!  "
5794,20,
5795,20,"he was a poet, sure a lover too,  "
5796,20,"who stood on latmus’ top, what time there blew  "
5797,20,soft breezes from the myrtle vale below;        
5798,20,"and brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow  "
5799,20,"a hymn from dian’s temple; while upswelling,  "
5800,20,"the incense went to her own starry dwelling,  "
5801,20,"but though her face was clear as infant’s eyes,  "
5802,20,"though she stood smiling o’er the sacrifice,          "
5803,20,"the poet wept at her so piteous fate,  "
5804,20,"wept that such beauty should be desolate,  "
5805,20,"so in fine wrath some golden sounds he won,  "
5806,20,"and gave meek cynthia her endymion,  "
5807,20,
5808,20,queen of the wide air; thou most lovely queen        
5809,20,of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen!  
5810,20,"as thou exceedest all things in thy shine,  "
5811,20,"so every tale, does this sweet tale of thine,  "
5812,20,"o for three words of honey, that i might  "
5813,20,tell but one wonder of thy bridal night!        
5814,20,
5815,20,"where distant ships do seem to show their keels,  "
5816,20,"phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels,  "
5817,20,"and turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes,  "
5818,20,"ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize,  "
5819,20,"the evening weather was so bright, and clear,        "
5820,20,that men of health were of unusual cheer;  
5821,20,"stepping like homer at the trumpet’s call,  "
5822,20,"or young apollo on the pedestal,  "
5823,20,"and lovely women were as fair and warm,  "
5824,20,"as venus looking sideways in alarm,        "
5825,20,"the breezes were ethereal, and pure,  "
5826,20,and crept through half closed lattices to cure  
5827,20,"the languid sick; it cool’d their fever’d sleep,  "
5828,20,"and soothed them into slumbers full and deep,  "
5829,20,"soon they awoke clear eyed, nor burnt with thirsting    "
5830,20,"nor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting,  "
5831,20,"and springing up, they met the wond’ring sight  "
5832,20,"of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight;  "
5833,20,"who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare,  "
5834,20,"and on their placid foreheads part the hair,        "
5835,20,"young men, and maidens at each other gaz’d  "
5836,20,"with hands held back, and motionless, amaz’d  "
5837,20,to see the brightness in each others’ eyes;  
5838,20,"and so they stood, fill’d with a sweet surprise,  "
5839,20,"until their tongues were loos’d in poesy,        "
5840,20,"therefore no lover did of anguish die,  "
5841,20,"but the soft numbers, in that moment spoken,  "
5842,20,"made silken ties, that never may be broken,  "
5843,20,"cynthia! i cannot tell the greater blisses,  "
5844,20,"that follow’d thine, and thy dear shepherd’s kisses,  "
5845,20,"was there a poet born?—but now no more,  "
5846,20,"my wand’ring spirit must no further soar,—"
5847,21,"if by dull rhymes our english must be chain'd,"
5848,21,"    and, like andromeda, the sonnet sweet"
5849,21,"  fetter'd, in spite of pained loveliness;"
5850,21,"  let us find out, if we must be constrain'd,"
5851,21,    sandals more interwoven and complete
5852,21,  to fit the naked foot of poesy;
5853,21,"  let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress"
5854,21,"  of every chord, and see what may be gain'd"
5855,21,"    by ear industrious, and attention meet,"
5856,21," misers of sound and syllable, no less"
5857,21,"   than midas of his coinage, let us be"
5858,21,   jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown;
5859,21," so, if we may not let the muse be free,"
5860,21,"   she will be bound with garlands of her own,"
5861,22,"in drear-nighted december,"
5862,22,"too happy, happy tree,"
5863,22,thy branches ne'er remember
5864,22,"their green felicity,"
5865,22,the north cannot undo them
5866,22,with a sleety whistle through them;
5867,22,nor frozen thawings glue them
5868,22,"from budding at the prime,"
5869,22,
5870,22,"in drear-nighted december,"
5871,22,"too happy, happy brook,"
5872,22,thy bubblings ne'er remember
5873,22,apollo's summer look;
5874,22,"but with a sweet forgetting,"
5875,22,"they stay their crystal fretting,"
5876,22,"never, never petting"
5877,22,"about the frozen time,"
5878,22,
5879,22,ah! would 'twere so with many
5880,22,a gentle girl and boy!
5881,22,but were there ever any
5882,22,writhed not at passed joy?
5883,22,"the feel of not to feel it,"
5884,22,when there is none to heal it
5885,22,"nor numbed sense to steel it,"
5886,22,"was never said in rhyme,"
5887,23,"i,"
5888,23,"fair isabel, poor simple isabel!"
5889,23,"lorenzo, a young palmer in love's eye!"
5890,23,they could not in the self-same mansion dwell
5891,23,"without some stir of heart, some malady;"
5892,23,they could not sit at meals but feel how well
5893,23,it soothed each to be the other by;
5894,23,"they could not, sure, beneath the same roof sleep"
5895,23,"but to each other dream, and nightly weep,"
5896,23,
5897,23,"ii,"
5898,23,"with every morn their love grew tenderer,"
5899,23,with every eve deeper and tenderer still;
5900,23,"he might not in house, field, or garden stir,"
5901,23,but her full shape would all his seeing fill;
5902,23,and his continual voice was pleasanter
5903,23,"to her, than noise of trees or hidden rill;"
5904,23,"her lute-string gave an echo of his name,"
5905,23,"she spoilt her half-done broidery with the same,"
5906,23,
5907,23,"iii,"
5908,23,"he knew whose gentle hand was at the latch,"
5909,23,before the door had given her to his eyes;
5910,23,and from her chamber-window he would catch
5911,23,her beauty farther than the falcon spies;
5912,23,"and constant as her vespers would he watch,"
5913,23,because her face was turn'd to the same skies;
5914,23,"and with sick longing all the night outwear,"
5915,23,"to hear her morning-step upon the stair,"
5916,23,
5917,23,"iv,"
5918,23,a whole long month of may in this sad plight
5919,23,"made their cheeks paler by the break of june,"
5920,23,"to morrow will i bow to my delight,"
5921,23,"to-morrow will i ask my lady's boon,--"
5922,23,"o may i never see another night,"
5923,23,"lorenzo, if thy lips breathe not love's tune,--"
5924,23,"so spake they to their pillows; but, alas,"
5925,23,honeyless days and days did he let pass;
5926,23,
5927,23,"v,"
5928,23,until sweet isabella's untouch'd cheek
5929,23,"fell sick within the rose's just domain,"
5930,23,"fell thin as a young mother's, who doth seek"
5931,23,"by every lull to cool her infant's pain,"
5932,23,"how ill she is, said he, i may not speak,"
5933,23,"and yet i will, and tell my love all plain,"
5934,23,"if looks speak love-laws, i will drink her tears,"
5935,23,"and at the least 'twill startle off her cares,"
5936,23,
5937,23,"vi,"
5938,23,"so said he one fair morning, and all day"
5939,23,his heart beat awfully against his side;
5940,23,and to his heart he inwardly did pray
5941,23,for power to speak; but still the ruddy tide
5942,23,"stifled his voice, and puls'd resolve away--"
5943,23,"fever'd his high conceit of such a bride,"
5944,23,"yet brought him to the meekness of a child,"
5945,23,alas! when passion is both meek and wild!
5946,23,
5947,23,"vii,"
5948,23,so once more he had wak'd and anguished
5949,23,"a dreary night of love and misery,"
5950,23,if isabel's quick eye had not been wed
5951,23,to every symbol on his forehead high;
5952,23,"she saw it waxing very pale and dead,"
5953,23,"and straight all flush'd; so, lisped tenderly,"
5954,23,"lorenzo!--here she ceas'd her timid quest,"
5955,23,"but in her tone and look he read the rest,"
5956,23,
5957,23,"viii,"
5958,23,"o isabella, i can half perceive"
5959,23,that i may speak my grief into thine ear;
5960,23,"if thou didst ever any thing believe,"
5961,23,"believe how i love thee, believe how near"
5962,23,"my soul is to its doom, i would not grieve"
5963,23,"thy hand by unwelcome pressing, would not fear"
5964,23,thine eyes by gazing; but i cannot live
5965,23,"another night, and not my passion shrive,"
5966,23,
5967,23,"ix,"
5968,23,"love! thou art leading me from wintry cold,"
5969,23,"lady! thou leadest me to summer clime,"
5970,23,and i must taste the blossoms that unfold
5971,23,"in its ripe warmth this gracious morning time,"
5972,23,"so said, his erewhile timid lips grew bold,"
5973,23,"and poesied with hers in dewy rhyme,"
5974,23,"great bliss was with them, and great happiness"
5975,23,"grew, like a lusty flower in june's caress,"
5976,23,
5977,23,"x,"
5978,23,"parting they seem'd to tread upon the air,"
5979,23,twin roses by the zephyr blown apart
5980,23,"only to meet again more close, and share"
5981,23,"the inward fragrance of each other's heart,"
5982,23,"she, to her chamber gone, a ditty fair"
5983,23,"sang, of delicious love and honey'd dart;"
5984,23,"he with light steps went up a western hill,"
5985,23,"and bade the sun farewell, and joy'd his fill,"
5986,23,
5987,23,"xi,"
5988,23,"all close they met again, before the dusk"
5989,23,"had taken from the stars its pleasant veil,"
5990,23,"all close they met, all eves, before the dusk"
5991,23,"had taken from the stars its pleasant veil,"
5992,23,"close in a bower of hyacinth and musk,"
5993,23,"unknown of any, free from whispering tale,"
5994,23,"ah! better had it been for ever so,"
5995,23,"than idle ears should pleasure in their woe,"
5996,23,
5997,23,"xii,"
5998,23,were they unhappy then?--it cannot be--
5999,23,"too many tears for lovers have been shed,"
6000,23,"too many sighs give we to them in fee,"
6001,23,"too much of pity after they are dead,"
6002,23,"too many doleful stories do we see,"
6003,23,whose matter in bright gold were best be read;
6004,23,except in such a page where theseus' spouse
6005,23,"over the pathless waves towards him bows,"
6006,23,
6007,23,"xiii,"
6008,23,"but, for the general award of love,"
6009,23,the little sweet doth kill much bitterness;
6010,23,"though dido silent is in under-grove,"
6011,23,"and isabella's was a great distress,"
6012,23,though young lorenzo in warm indian clove
6013,23,"was not embalm'd, this truth is not the less--"
6014,23,"even bees, the little almsmen of spring-bowers,"
6015,23,"know there is richest juice in poison-flowers,"
6016,23,
6017,23,"xiv,"
6018,23,"with her two brothers this fair lady dwelt,"
6019,23,"enriched from ancestral merchandize,"
6020,23,and for them many a weary hand did swelt
6021,23,"in torched mines and noisy factories,"
6022,23,and many once proud-quiver'd loins did melt
6023,23,in blood from stinging whip;--with hollow eyes
6024,23,"many all day in dazzling river stood,"
6025,23,"to take the rich-ored driftings of the flood,"
6026,23,
6027,23,"xv,"
6028,23,"for them the ceylon diver held his breath,"
6029,23,and went all naked to the hungry shark;
6030,23,for them his ears gush'd blood; for them in death
6031,23,the seal on the cold ice with piteous bark
6032,23,lay full of darts; for them alone did seethe
6033,23,"a thousand men in troubles wide and dark,"
6034,23,"half-ignorant, they turn'd an easy wheel,"
6035,23,"that set sharp racks at work, to pinch and peel,"
6036,23,
6037,23,"xvi,"
6038,23,why were they proud? because their marble founts
6039,23,gush'd with more pride than do a wretch's tears?--
6040,23,why were they proud? because fair orange-mounts
6041,23,were of more soft ascent than lazar stairs?--
6042,23,why were they proud? because red-lin'd accounts
6043,23,were richer than the songs of grecian years?--
6044,23,"why were they proud? again we ask aloud,"
6045,23,why in the name of glory were they proud?
6046,23,
6047,23,"xvii,"
6048,23,yet were these florentines as self-retired
6049,23,"in hungry pride and gainful cowardice,"
6050,23,"as two close hebrews in that land inspired,"
6051,23,"paled in and vineyarded from beggar-spies,"
6052,23,the hawks of ship-mast forests--the untired
6053,23,and pannier'd mules for ducats and old lies--
6054,23,"quick cat's-paws on the generous stray-away,--"
6055,23,"great wits in spanish, tuscan, and malay,"
6056,23,
6057,23,"xviii,"
6058,23,how was it these same ledger-men could spy
6059,23,fair isabella in her downy nest?
6060,23,how could they find out in lorenzo's eye
6061,23,a straying from his toil? hot egypt's pest
6062,23,into their vision covetous and sly!
6063,23,how could these money-bags see east and west?--
6064,23,yet so they did--and every dealer fair
6065,23,"must see behind, as doth the hunted hare,"
6066,23,
6067,23,"xix,"
6068,23,o eloquent and famed boccaccio!
6069,23,"of thee we now should ask forgiving boon,"
6070,23,"and of thy spicy myrtles as they blow,"
6071,23,"and of thy roses amorous of the moon,"
6072,23,"and of thy lilies, that do paler grow"
6073,23,"now they can no more hear thy ghittern's tune,"
6074,23,for venturing syllables that ill beseem
6075,23,"the quiet glooms of such a piteous theme,"
6076,23,
6077,23,"xx,"
6078,23,"grant thou a pardon here, and then the tale"
6079,23,"shall move on soberly, as it is meet;"
6080,23,"there is no other crime, no mad assail"
6081,23,"to make old prose in modern rhyme more sweet,"
6082,23,but it is done--succeed the verse or fail--
6083,23,"to honour thee, and thy gone spirit greet;"
6084,23,"to stead thee as a verse in english tongue,"
6085,23,"an echo of thee in the north-wind sung,"
6086,23,
6087,23,"xxi,"
6088,23,these brethren having found by many signs
6089,23,"what love lorenzo for their sister had,"
6090,23,"and how she lov'd him too, each unconfines"
6091,23,"his bitter thoughts to other, well nigh mad"
6092,23,"that he, the servant of their trade designs,"
6093,23,"should in their sister's love be blithe and glad,"
6094,23,when 'twas their plan to coax her by degrees
6095,23,"to some high noble and his olive-trees,"
6096,23,
6097,23,"xxii,"
6098,23,"and many a jealous conference had they,"
6099,23,"and many times they bit their lips alone,"
6100,23,before they fix'd upon a surest way
6101,23,to make the youngster for his crime atone;
6102,23,"and at the last, these men of cruel clay"
6103,23,cut mercy with a sharp knife to the bone;
6104,23,for they resolved in some forest dim
6105,23,"to kill lorenzo, and there bury him,"
6106,23,
6107,23,"xxiii,"
6108,23,"so on a pleasant morning, as he leant"
6109,23,"into the sun-rise, o'er the balustrade"
6110,23,"of the garden-terrace, towards him they bent"
6111,23,"their footing through the dews; and to him said,"
6112,23,"you seem there in the quiet of content,"
6113,23,"lorenzo, and we are most loth to invade"
6114,23,"calm speculation; but if you are wise,"
6115,23,"bestride your steed while cold is in the skies,"
6116,23,
6117,23,"xxiv,"
6118,23,"to-day we purpose, ay, this hour we mount"
6119,23,to spur three leagues towards the apennine;
6120,23,"come down, we pray thee, ere the hot sun count"
6121,23,"his dewy rosary on the eglantine,"
6122,23,"lorenzo, courteously as he was wont,"
6123,23,bow'd a fair greeting to these serpents' whine;
6124,23,"and went in haste, to get in readiness,"
6125,23,"with belt, and spur, and bracing huntsman's dress,"
6126,23,
6127,23,"xxv,"
6128,23,"and as he to the court-yard pass'd along,"
6129,23,"each third step did he pause, and listen'd oft"
6130,23,"if he could hear his lady's matin-song,"
6131,23,or the light whisper of her footstep soft;
6132,23,"and as he thus over his passion hung,"
6133,23,he heard a laugh full musical aloft;
6134,23,"when, looking up, he saw her features bright"
6135,23,"smile through an in-door lattice, all delight,"
6136,23,
6137,23,"xxvi,"
6138,23,"love, isabel! said he, i was in pain"
6139,23,"lest i should miss to bid thee a good morrow,"
6140,23,"ah! what if i should lose thee, when so fain"
6141,23,i am to stifle all the heavy sorrow
6142,23,of a poor three hours' absence? but we'll gain
6143,23,"out of the amorous dark what day doth borrow,"
6144,23,"good bye! i'll soon be back,--good bye! said she,--"
6145,23,"and as he went she chanted merrily,"
6146,23,
6147,23,"xxvii,"
6148,23,so the two brothers and their murder'd man
6149,23,"rode past fair florence, to where arno's stream"
6150,23,"gurgles through straiten'd banks, and still doth fan"
6151,23,"itself with dancing bulrush, and the bream"
6152,23,"keeps head against the freshets, sick and wan"
6153,23,"the brothers' faces in the ford did seem,"
6154,23,"lorenzo's flush with love,--they pass'd the water"
6155,23,"into a forest quiet for the slaughter,"
6156,23,
6157,23,"xxviii,"
6158,23,"there was lorenzo slain and buried in,"
6159,23,there in that forest did his great love cease;
6160,23,"ah! when a soul doth thus its freedom win,"
6161,23,it aches in loneliness--is ill at peace
6162,23,"as the break-covert blood-hounds of such sin,"
6163,23,"they dipp'd their swords in the water, and did tease"
6164,23,"their horses homeward, with convulsed spur,"
6165,23,"each richer by his being a murderer,"
6166,23,
6167,23,"xxix,"
6168,23,"they told their sister how, with sudden speed,"
6169,23,"lorenzo had ta'en ship for foreign lands,"
6170,23,because of some great urgency and need
6171,23,"in their affairs, requiring trusty hands,"
6172,23,"poor girl! put on thy stifling widow's weed,"
6173,23,and 'scape at once from hope's accursed bands;
6174,23,"to-day thou wilt not see him, nor to-morrow,"
6175,23,"and the next day will be a day of sorrow,"
6176,23,
6177,23,"xxx,"
6178,23,she weeps alone for pleasures not to be;
6179,23,"sorely she wept until the night came on,"
6180,23,"and then, instead of love, o misery!"
6181,23,"she brooded o'er the luxury alone,"
6182,23,"his image in the dusk she seem'd to see,"
6183,23,"and to the silence made a gentle moan,"
6184,23,"spreading her perfect arms upon the air,"
6185,23,"and on her couch low murmuring, where? o where?"
6186,23,
6187,23,"xxxi,"
6188,23,"but selfishness, love's cousin, held not long"
6189,23,its fiery vigil in her single breast;
6190,23,"she fretted for the golden hour, and hung"
6191,23,upon the time with feverish unrest--
6192,23,not long--for soon into her heart a throng
6193,23,"of higher occupants, a richer zest,"
6194,23,"came tragic; passion not to be subdued,"
6195,23,"and sorrow for her love in travels rude,"
6196,23,
6197,23,"xxxii,"
6198,23,"in the mid days of autumn, on their eves"
6199,23,"the breath of winter comes from far away,"
6200,23,and the sick west continually bereaves
6201,23,"of some gold tinge, and plays a roundelay"
6202,23,"of death among the bushes and the leaves,"
6203,23,to make all bare before he dares to stray
6204,23,"from his north cavern, so sweet isabel"
6205,23,"by gradual decay from beauty fell,"
6206,23,
6207,23,"xxxiii,"
6208,23,"because lorenzo came not, oftentimes"
6209,23,"she ask'd her brothers, with an eye all pale,"
6210,23,"striving to be itself, what dungeon climes"
6211,23,could keep him off so long? they spake a tale
6212,23,"time after time, to quiet her, their crimes"
6213,23,"came on them, like a smoke from hinnom's vale;"
6214,23,"and every night in dreams they groan'd aloud,"
6215,23,"to see their sister in her snowy shroud,"
6216,23,
6217,23,"xxxiv,"
6218,23,"and she had died in drowsy ignorance,"
6219,23,but for a thing more deadly dark than all;
6220,23,"it came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance,"
6221,23,which saves a sick man from the feather'd pall
6222,23,"for some few gasping moments; like a lance,"
6223,23,waking an indian from his cloudy hall
6224,23,"with cruel pierce, and bringing him again"
6225,23,"sense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain,"
6226,23,
6227,23,"xxxv,"
6228,23,"it was a vision,--in the drowsy gloom,"
6229,23,"the dull of midnight, at her couch's foot"
6230,23,"lorenzo stood, and wept, the forest tomb"
6231,23,had marr'd his glossy hair which once could shoot
6232,23,"lustre into the sun, and put cold doom"
6233,23,"upon his lips, and taken the soft lute"
6234,23,"from his lorn voice, and past his loamed ears"
6235,23,"had made a miry channel for his tears,"
6236,23,
6237,23,"xxxvi,"
6238,23,"strange sound it was, when the pale shadow spake;"
6239,23,"for there was striving, in its piteous tongue,"
6240,23,"to speak as when on earth it was awake,"
6241,23,"and isabella on its music hung,"
6242,23,"languor there was in it, and tremulous shake,"
6243,23,as in a palsied druid's harp unstrung;
6244,23,"and through it moan'd a ghostly under-song,"
6245,23,"like hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among,"
6246,23,
6247,23,"xxxvii,"
6248,23,"its eyes, though wild, were still all dewy bright"
6249,23,"with love, and kept all phantom fear aloof"
6250,23,"from the poor girl by magic of their light,"
6251,23,the while it did unthread the horrid woof
6252,23,"of the late darken'd time,--the murderous spite"
6253,23,"of pride and avarice,--the dark pine roof"
6254,23,"in the forest,--and the sodden turfed dell,"
6255,23,"where, without any word, from stabs he fell,"
6256,23,
6257,23,"xxxviii,"
6258,23,"saying moreover, isabel, my sweet!"
6259,23,"red whortle-berries droop above my head,"
6260,23,and a large flint-stone weighs upon my feet;
6261,23,around me beeches and high chestnuts shed
6262,23,their leaves and prickly nuts; a sheep-fold bleat
6263,23,"comes from beyond the river to my bed,"
6264,23,"go, shed one tear upon my heather-bloom,"
6265,23,"and it shall comfort me within the tomb,"
6266,23,
6267,23,"xxxix,"
6268,23,"i am a shadow now, alas! alas!"
6269,23,upon the skirts of human-nature dwelling
6270,23,"alone, i chant alone the holy mass,"
6271,23,"while little sounds of life are round me knelling,"
6272,23,"and glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass,"
6273,23,"and many a chapel bell the hour is telling,"
6274,23,"paining me through, those sounds grow strange to me,"
6275,23,"and thou art distant in humanity,"
6276,23,
6277,23,"xl,"
6278,23,"i know what was, i feel full well what is,"
6279,23,"and i should rage, if spirits could go mad;"
6280,23,"though i forget the taste of earthly bliss,"
6281,23,"that paleness warms my grave, as though i had"
6282,23,a seraph chosen from the bright abyss
6283,23,"to be my spouse, thy paleness makes me glad;"
6284,23,"thy beauty grows upon me, and i feel"
6285,23,"a greater love through all my essence steal,"
6286,23,
6287,23,"xli,"
6288,23,"the spirit mourn'd adieu!--dissolv'd, and left"
6289,23,the atom darkness in a slow turmoil;
6290,23,"as when of healthful midnight sleep bereft,"
6291,23,"thinking on rugged hours and fruitless toil,"
6292,23,"we put our eyes into a pillowy cleft,"
6293,23,"and see the spangly gloom froth up and boil,"
6294,23,"it made sad isabella's eyelids ache,"
6295,23,and in the dawn she started up awake;
6296,23,
6297,23,"xlii,"
6298,23,"ha! ha! said she, i knew not this hard life,"
6299,23,i thought the worst was simple misery;
6300,23,i thought some fate with pleasure or with strife
6301,23,"portion'd us--happy days, or else to die;"
6302,23,but there is crime--a brother's bloody knife!
6303,23,"sweet spirit, thou hast school'd my infancy,"
6304,23,"i'll visit thee for this, and kiss thine eyes,"
6305,23,"and greet thee morn and even in the skies,"
6306,23,
6307,23,"xliii,"
6308,23,"when the full morning came, she had devised"
6309,23,how she might secret to the forest hie;
6310,23,"how she might find the clay, so dearly prized,"
6311,23,and sing to it one latest lullaby;
6312,23,"how her short absence might be unsurmised,"
6313,23,"while she the inmost of the dream would try,"
6314,23,"resolv'd, she took with her an aged nurse,"
6315,23,"and went into that dismal forest-hearse,"
6316,23,
6317,23,"xliv,"
6318,23,"see, as they creep along the river side,"
6319,23,"how she doth whisper to that aged dame,"
6320,23,"and, after looking round the champaign wide,"
6321,23,"shows her a knife,--what feverous hectic flame"
6322,23,"burns in thee, child?--what good can thee betide,"
6323,23,"that thou should'st smile again?--the evening came,"
6324,23,and they had found lorenzo's earthy bed;
6325,23,"the flint was there, the berries at his head,"
6326,23,
6327,23,"xlv,"
6328,23,"who hath not loiter'd in a green church-yard,"
6329,23,"and let his spirit, like a demon-mole,"
6330,23,"work through the clayey soil and gravel hard,"
6331,23,"to see skull, coffin'd bones, and funeral stole;"
6332,23,"pitying each form that hungry death hath marr'd,"
6333,23,and filling it once more with human soul?
6334,23,ah! this is holiday to what was felt
6335,23,"when isabella by lorenzo knelt,"
6336,23,
6337,23,"xlvi,"
6338,23,"she gaz'd into the fresh-thrown mould, as though"
6339,23,one glance did fully all its secrets tell;
6340,23,"clearly she saw, as other eyes would know"
6341,23,pale limbs at bottom of a crystal well;
6342,23,"upon the murderous spot she seem'd to grow,"
6343,23,"like to a native lily of the dell,"
6344,23,"then with her knife, all sudden, she began"
6345,23,"to dig more fervently than misers can,"
6346,23,
6347,23,"xlvii,"
6348,23,"soon she turn'd up a soiled glove, whereon"
6349,23,"her silk had play'd in purple phantasies,"
6350,23,"she kiss'd it with a lip more chill than stone,"
6351,23,"and put it in her bosom, where it dries"
6352,23,and freezes utterly unto the bone
6353,23,"those dainties made to still an infant's cries,"
6354,23,"then 'gan she work again; nor stay'd her care,"
6355,23,"but to throw back at times her veiling hair,"
6356,23,
6357,23,"xlviii,"
6358,23,"that old nurse stood beside her wondering,"
6359,23,until her heart felt pity to the core
6360,23,"at sight of such a dismal labouring,"
6361,23,"and so she kneeled, with her locks all hoar,"
6362,23,"and put her lean hands to the horrid thing,"
6363,23,three hours they labour'd at this travail sore;
6364,23,"at last they felt the kernel of the grave,"
6365,23,"and isabella did not stamp and rave,"
6366,23,
6367,23,"xlix,"
6368,23,ah! wherefore all this wormy circumstance?
6369,23,why linger at the yawning tomb so long?
6370,23,"o for the gentleness of old romance,"
6371,23,the simple plaining of a minstrel's song!
6372,23,"fair reader, at the old tale take a glance,"
6373,23,"for here, in truth, it doth not well belong"
6374,23,"to speak,--o turn thee to the very tale,"
6375,23,"and taste the music of that vision pale,"
6376,23,
6377,23,"l,"
6378,23,with duller steel than the persèan sword
6379,23,"they cut away no formless monster's head,"
6380,23,"but one, whose gentleness did well accord"
6381,23,"with death, as life, the ancient harps have said,"
6382,23,"love never dies, but lives, immortal lord,"
6383,23,"if love impersonate was ever dead,"
6384,23,"pale isabella kiss'd it, and low moan'd,"
6385,23,"'twas love; cold,--dead indeed, but not dethroned,"
6386,23,
6387,23,"li,"
6388,23,"in anxious secrecy they took it home,"
6389,23,"and then the prize was all for isabel,"
6390,23,"she calm'd its wild hair with a golden comb,"
6391,23,and all around each eye's sepulchral cell
6392,23,pointed each fringed lash; the smeared loam
6393,23,"with tears, as chilly as a dripping well,"
6394,23,"she drench'd away,--and still she comb'd, and kept"
6395,23,"sighing all day--and still she kiss'd, and wept,"
6396,23,
6397,23,"lii,"
6398,23,"then in a silken scarf,--sweet with the dews"
6399,23,"of precious flowers pluck'd in araby,"
6400,23,and divine liquids come with odorous ooze
6401,23,"through the cold serpent pipe refreshfully,--"
6402,23,she wrapp'd it up; and for its tomb did choose
6403,23,"a garden-pot, wherein she laid it by,"
6404,23,"and cover'd it with mould, and o'er it set"
6405,23,"sweet basil, which her tears kept ever wet,"
6406,23,
6407,23,"liii,"
6408,23,"and she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun,"
6409,23,"and she forgot the blue above the trees,"
6410,23,"and she forgot the dells where waters run,"
6411,23,and she forgot the chilly autumn breeze;
6412,23,"she had no knowledge when the day was done,"
6413,23,"and the new morn she saw not, but in peace"
6414,23,"hung over her sweet basil evermore,"
6415,23,"and moisten'd it with tears unto the core,"
6416,23,
6417,23,"liv,"
6418,23,"and so she ever fed it with thin tears,"
6419,23,"whence thick, and green, and beautiful it grew,"
6420,23,so that it smelt more balmy than its peers
6421,23,of basil-tufts in florence; for it drew
6422,23,"nurture besides, and life, from human fears,"
6423,23,"from the fast mouldering head there shut from view,"
6424,23,"so that the jewel, safely casketed,"
6425,23,"came forth, and in perfumed leafits spread,"
6426,23,
6427,23,"lv,"
6428,23,"o melancholy, linger here awhile!"
6429,23,"o music, music, breathe despondingly!"
6430,23,"o echo, echo, from some sombre isle,"
6431,23,"unknown, lethean, sigh to us--o sigh!"
6432,23,"spirits in grief, lift up your heads, and smile;"
6433,23,"lift up your heads, sweet spirits, heavily,"
6434,23,"and make a pale light in your cypress glooms,"
6435,23,"tinting with silver wan your marble tombs,"
6436,23,
6437,23,"lvi,"
6438,23,"moan hither, all ye syllables of woe,"
6439,23,from the deep throat of sad melpomene!
6440,23,"through bronzed lyre in tragic order go,"
6441,23,and touch the strings into a mystery;
6442,23,sound mournfully upon the winds and low;
6443,23,for simple isabel is soon to be
6444,23,"among the dead, she withers, like a palm"
6445,23,"cut by an indian for its juicy balm,"
6446,23,
6447,23,"lvii,"
6448,23,o leave the palm to wither by itself;
6449,23,let not quick winter chill its dying hour!--
6450,23,"it may not be--those baalites of pelf,"
6451,23,"her brethren, noted the continual shower"
6452,23,"from her dead eyes; and many a curious elf,"
6453,23,"among her kindred, wonder'd that such dower"
6454,23,of youth and beauty should be thrown aside
6455,23,"by one mark'd out to be a noble's bride,"
6456,23,
6457,23,"lviii,"
6458,23,"and, furthermore, her brethren wonder'd much"
6459,23,"why she sat drooping by the basil green,"
6460,23,"and why it flourish'd, as by magic touch;"
6461,23,"greatly they wonder'd what the thing might mean,"
6462,23,"they could not surely give belief, that such"
6463,23,a very nothing would have power to wean
6464,23,"her from her own fair youth, and pleasures gay,"
6465,23,"and even remembrance of her love's delay,"
6466,23,
6467,23,"lix,"
6468,23,therefore they watch'd a time when they might sift
6469,23,this hidden whim; and long they watch'd in vain;
6470,23,"for seldom did she go to chapel-shrift,"
6471,23,and seldom felt she any hunger-pain;
6472,23,"and when she left, she hurried back, as swift"
6473,23,as bird on wing to breast its eggs again;
6474,23,"and, patient as a hen-bird, sat her there"
6475,23,"beside her basil, weeping through her hair,"
6476,23,
6477,23,"lx,"
6478,23,"yet they contriv'd to steal the basil-pot,"
6479,23,"and to examine it in secret place,"
6480,23,"the thing was vile with green and livid spot,"
6481,23,"and yet they knew it was lorenzo's face,"
6482,23,"the guerdon of their murder they had got,"
6483,23,"and so left florence in a moment's space,"
6484,23,"never to turn again,--away they went,"
6485,23,"with blood upon their heads, to banishment,"
6486,23,
6487,23,"lxi,"
6488,23,"o melancholy, turn thine eyes away!"
6489,23,"o music, music, breathe despondingly!"
6490,23,"o echo, echo, on some other day,"
6491,23,"from isles lethean, sigh to us--o sigh!"
6492,23,"spirits of grief, sing not your well-a-way!"
6493,23,"for isabel, sweet isabel, will die;"
6494,23,"will die a death too lone and incomplete,"
6495,23,"now they have ta'en away her basil sweet,"
6496,23,
6497,23,"lxii,"
6498,23,"piteous she look'd on dead and senseless things,"
6499,23,"asking for her lost basil amorously,"
6500,23,and with melodious chuckle in the strings
6501,23,"of her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry"
6502,23,"after the pilgrim in his wanderings,"
6503,23,to ask him where her basil was; and why
6504,23,"'twas hid from her, for cruel 'tis, said she,"
6505,23,"to steal my basil-pot away from me,"
6506,23,
6507,23,"lxiii,"
6508,23,"and so she pined, and so she died forlorn,"
6509,23,"imploring for her basil to the last,"
6510,23,no heart was there in florence but did mourn
6511,23,"in pity of her love, so overcast,"
6512,23,and a sad ditty of this story born
6513,23,"from mouth to mouth through all the country pass'd,"
6514,23,"still is the burthen sung--o cruelty,"
6515,23,to steal my basil-pot away from me!
6516,24,"keen, fitful gusts are whisp'ring here and there"
6517,24,"among the bushes half leafless, and dry;"
6518,24,"the stars look very cold about the sky,"
6519,24,"and i have many miles on foot to fare,"
6520,24,"yet feel i little of the cool bleak air,"
6521,24,"or of the dead leaves rustling drearily,"
6522,24,"or of those silver lamps that burn on high,"
6523,24,"or of the distance from home's pleasant lair,"
6524,24,for i am brimfull of the friendliness
6525,24,that in a little cottage i have found;
6526,24,"of fair-hair'd milton's eloquent distress,"
6527,24,and all his love for gentle lycid drown'd;
6528,24,"of lovely laura in her light green dress,"
6529,24,"and faithful petrarch gloriously crown'd,"
6530,25,"ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,"
6531,25,     alone and palely loitering?
6532,25,"the sedge is withered from the lake,"
6533,25,"     and no birds sing,"
6534,25,
6535,25,"ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,"
6536,25,     so haggard and so woe-begone
6537,25,"the squirrel's granary is full,"
6538,25,"     and the harvest's done,"
6539,25,
6540,25,i see a lily on thy brow
6541,25,"     with anguish moist and fever dew,"
6542,25,and on thy cheek a fading rose
6543,25,"     fast withereth too,"
6544,25,
6545,25,"i met a lady in the meads,"
6546,25,"     full beautiful, a faery's child,"
6547,25,"her hair was long, her foot was ligh,"
6548,25,"     and her eyes were wild,"
6549,25,
6550,25,"i set her on my pacing steed,"
6551,25,     and nothing else saw all day long;
6552,25,"for sideways would she lean, and sing"
6553,25,"     a faery's song,"
6554,25,
6555,25,"i made a garland for her head,"
6556,25,"     and bracelets too, and fragrant zone;"
6557,25,"she looked at me as she did love,"
6558,25,"     and made sweet moan,"
6559,25,
6560,25,"she found me roots of relish sweet,"
6561,25,"     and honey wild, and manna dew,"
6562,25,"and sure in language strange she said,"
6563,25,     i love thee true!
6564,25,
6565,25,"she took me to her elfin grot,"
6566,25,"     and there she gazed and sighed deep,"
6567,25,"and there i shut her wild, sad eyes---"
6568,25,"     so kissed to sleep,"
6569,25,
6570,25,"and there we slumbered on the moss,"
6571,25,"     and there i dreamed, ah! woe betide,"
6572,25,the latest dream i ever dreamed
6573,25,"     on the cold hill side,"
6574,25,
6575,25,"i saw pale kings, and princes too,"
6576,25,"     pale warriors, death-pale were they all;"
6577,25,who cried---la belle dame sans merci
6578,25,     hath thee in thrall!
6579,25,
6580,25,"i saw their starved lips in the gloam,"
6581,25,"     with horrid warning gaped wide,"
6582,25,"and i awoke and found me here,"
6583,25,"     on the cold hill side,"
6584,25,
6585,25,"and that is why i sojourn here,"
6586,25,"     alone and palely loitering,"
6587,25,"though the sedge is withered from the lake,"
6588,25,"     and no birds sing,"
6589,26,"upon a time, before the faery broods"
6590,26,"drove nymph and satyr from the prosperous woods,"
6591,26,"before king oberon's bright diadem,"
6592,26,"sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem,"
6593,26,frighted away the dryads and the fauns
6594,26,"from rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns,"
6595,26,the ever-smitten hermes empty left
6596,26,"his golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft,"
6597,26,"from high olympus had he stolen light,"
6598,26,"on this side of jove's clouds, to escape the sight"
6599,26,"of his great summoner, and made retreat"
6600,26,"into a forest on the shores of crete,"
6601,26,for somewhere in that sacred island dwelt
6602,26,"a nymph, to whom all hoofed satyrs knelt;"
6603,26,at whose white feet the languid tritons poured
6604,26,"pearls, while on land they wither'd and adored,"
6605,26,"fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont,"
6606,26,"and in those meads where sometime she might haunt,"
6607,26,"were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any muse,"
6608,26,"though fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose,"
6609,26,"ah, what a world of love was at her feet!"
6610,26,"so hermes thought, and a celestial heat"
6611,26,"burnt from his winged heels to either ear,"
6612,26,"that from a whiteness, as the lily clear,"
6613,26,"blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair,"
6614,26,"fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare,"
6615,26,"from vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew,"
6616,26,"breathing upon the flowers his passion new,"
6617,26,"and wound with many a river to its head,"
6618,26,"to find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed,"
6619,26,"in vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found,"
6620,26,"and so he rested, on the lonely ground,"
6621,26,"pensive, and full of painful jealousies"
6622,26,"of the wood-gods, and even the very trees,"
6623,26,"there as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,"
6624,26,"such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys"
6625,26,"all pain but pity, thus the lone voice spake,"
6626,26,when from this wreathed tomb shall i awake!
6627,26,"when move in a sweet body fit for life,"
6628,26,"and love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife"
6629,26,"of hearts and lips! ah, miserable me!"
6630,26,"the god, dove-footed, glided silently"
6631,26,"round bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed,"
6632,26,"the taller grasses and full-flowering weed,"
6633,26,"until he found a palpitating snake,"
6634,26,"bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake,"
6635,26,
6636,26,"   she was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,"
6637,26,"vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;"
6638,26,"striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard,"
6639,26,"eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr'd;"
6640,26,"and full of silver moons, that, as she breathed,"
6641,26,"dissolv'd, or brighter shone, or interwreathed"
6642,26,their lustres with the gloomier tapestries -
6643,26,"so rainbow-sided, touch'd with miseries,"
6644,26,"she seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf,"
6645,26,"some demon's mistress, or the demon's self,"
6646,26,upon her crest she wore a wannish fire
6647,26,"sprinkled with stars, like ariadne's tiar,"
6648,26,"her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet!"
6649,26,"she had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete,"
6650,26,"and for her eyes, what could such eyes do there"
6651,26,"but weep, and weep, that they were born so fair?"
6652,26,"as proserpine still weeps for her sicilian air,"
6653,26,"her throat was serpent, but the words she spake"
6654,26,"came, as through bubbling honey, for love's sake,"
6655,26,"and thus; while hermes on his pinions lay,"
6656,26,"like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey,"
6657,26,
6658,26,"   fair hermes, crown'd with feathers, fluttering light,"
6659,26,"i had a splendid dream of thee last night,"
6660,26,"i saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold,"
6661,26,"among the gods, upon olympus old,"
6662,26,the only sad one; for thou didst not hear
6663,26,"the soft, lute-finger'd muses chaunting clear,"
6664,26,"nor even apollo when he sang alone,"
6665,26,"deaf to his throbbing throat's long, long melodious moan,"
6666,26,"i dreamt i saw thee, robed in purple flakes,"
6667,26,"break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks,"
6668,26,"and, swiftly as a bright phoebean dart,"
6669,26,strike for the cretan isle; and here thou art!
6670,26,"too gentle hermes, hast thou found the maid?"
6671,26,whereat the star of lethe not delay'd
6672,26,"his rosy eloquence, and thus inquired,"
6673,26,"thou smooth-lipp'd serpent, surely high inspired!"
6674,26,"thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes,"
6675,26,"possess whatever bliss thou canst devise,"
6676,26,"telling me only where my nymph is fled, -"
6677,26,"where she doth breathe! bright planet, thou hast said,"
6678,26,"return'd the snake, but seal with oaths, fair god!"
6679,26,"i swear, said hermes, by my serpent rod,"
6680,26,"and by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!"
6681,26,"light flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown,"
6682,26,"then thus again the brilliance feminine,"
6683,26,"too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine,"
6684,26,"free as the air, invisibly, she strays"
6685,26,about these thornless wilds; her pleasant days
6686,26,she tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet
6687,26,leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet;
6688,26,"from weary tendrils, and bow'd branches green,"
6689,26,"she plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen,"
6690,26,and by my power is her beauty veil'd
6691,26,"to keep it unaffronted, unassail'd"
6692,26,"by the love-glances of unlovely eyes,"
6693,26,"of satyrs, fauns, and blear'd silenus' sighs,"
6694,26,"pale grew her immortality, for woe"
6695,26,"of all these lovers, and she grieved so"
6696,26,"i took compassion on her, bade her steep"
6697,26,"her hair in weird syrops, that would keep"
6698,26,"her loveliness invisible, yet free"
6699,26,"to wander as she loves, in liberty,"
6700,26,"thou shalt behold her, hermes, thou alone,"
6701,26,"if thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!"
6702,26,"then, once again, the charmed god began"
6703,26,"an oath, and through the serpent's ears it ran"
6704,26,"warm, tremulous, devout, psalterian,"
6705,26,"ravish'd, she lifted her circean head,"
6706,26,"blush'd a live damask, and swift-lisping said,"
6707,26,"i was a woman, let me have once more"
6708,26,"a woman's shape, and charming as before,"
6709,26,i love a youth of corinth - o the bliss!
6710,26,"give me my woman's form, and place me where he is,"
6711,26,"stoop, hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow,"
6712,26,"and thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now,"
6713,26,"the god on half-shut feathers sank serene,"
6714,26,"she breath'd upon his eyes, and swift was seen"
6715,26,"of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green,"
6716,26,"it was no dream; or say a dream it was,"
6717,26,"real are the dreams of gods, and smoothly pass"
6718,26,"their pleasures in a long immortal dream,"
6719,26,"one warm, flush'd moment, hovering, it might seem"
6720,26,"dash'd by the wood-nymph's beauty, so he burn'd;"
6721,26,"then, lighting on the printless verdure, turn'd"
6722,26,"to the swoon'd serpent, and with languid arm,"
6723,26,"delicate, put to proof the lythe caducean charm,"
6724,26,"so done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent,"
6725,26,"full of adoring tears and blandishment,"
6726,26,"and towards her stept, she, like a moon in wane,"
6727,26,"faded before him, cower'd, nor could restrain"
6728,26,"her fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower"
6729,26,"that faints into itself at evening hour,"
6730,26,"but the god fostering her chilled hand,"
6731,26,"she felt the warmth, her eyelids open'd bland,"
6732,26,"and, like new flowers at morning song of bees,"
6733,26,"bloom'd, and gave up her honey to the lees,"
6734,26,into the green-recessed woods they flew;
6735,26,"nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do,"
6736,26,
6737,26,"   left to herself, the serpent now began"
6738,26,"to change; her elfin blood in madness ran,"
6739,26,"her mouth foam'd, and the grass, therewith besprent,"
6740,26,wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent;
6741,26,"her eyes in torture fix'd, and anguish drear,"
6742,26,"hot, glaz'd, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear,"
6743,26,"flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear,"
6744,26,"the colours all inflam'd throughout her train,"
6745,26,"she writh'd about, convuls'd with scarlet pain,"
6746,26,a deep volcanian yellow took the place
6747,26,of all her milder-mooned body's grace;
6748,26,"and, as the lava ravishes the mead,"
6749,26,"spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede;"
6750,26,"made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars,"
6751,26,"eclips'd her crescents, and lick'd up her stars,"
6752,26,"so that, in moments few, she was undrest"
6753,26,"of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst,"
6754,26,"and rubious-argent, of all these bereft,"
6755,26,"nothing but pain and ugliness were left,"
6756,26,"still shone her crown; that vanish'd, also she"
6757,26,melted and disappear'd as suddenly;
6758,26,"and in the air, her new voice luting soft,"
6759,26,"cried, lycius! gentle lycius! - borne aloft"
6760,26,with the bright mists about the mountains hoar
6761,26,"these words dissolv'd, crete's forests heard no more,"
6762,26,
6763,26,"   whither fled lamia, now a lady bright,"
6764,26,a full-born beauty new and exquisite?
6765,26,she fled into that valley they pass o'er
6766,26,who go to corinth from cenchreas' shore;
6767,26,"and rested at the foot of those wild hills,"
6768,26,"the rugged founts of the peraean rills,"
6769,26,and of that other ridge whose barren back
6770,26,"stretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack,"
6771,26,"south-westward to cleone, there she stood"
6772,26,"about a young bird's flutter from a wood,"
6773,26,"fair, on a sloping green of mossy tread,"
6774,26,"by a clear pool, wherein she passioned"
6775,26,"to see herself escap'd from so sore ills,"
6776,26,"while her robes flaunted with the daffodils,"
6777,26,
6778,26,"   ah, happy lycius! - for she was a maid"
6779,26,"more beautiful than ever twisted braid,"
6780,26,"or sigh'd, or blush'd, or on spring-flowered lea"
6781,26,"spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy,"
6782,26,"a virgin purest lipp'd, yet in the lore"
6783,26,"of love deep learned to the red heart's core,"
6784,26,"not one hour old, yet of sciential brain"
6785,26,to unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain;
6786,26,"define their pettish limits, and estrange"
6787,26,"their points of contact, and swift counterchange;"
6788,26,"intrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart"
6789,26,its most ambiguous atoms with sure art;
6790,26,as though in cupid's college she had spent
6791,26,"sweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent,"
6792,26,"and kept his rosy terms in idle languishment,"
6793,26,
6794,26,   why this fair creature chose so fairily
6795,26,"by the wayside to linger, we shall see;"
6796,26,but first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse
6797,26,"and dream, when in the serpent prison-house,"
6798,26,"of all she list, strange or magnificent,"
6799,26,"how, ever, where she will'd, her spirit went;"
6800,26,"whether to faint elysium, or where"
6801,26,down through tress-lifting waves the nereids fair
6802,26,wind into thetis' bower by many a pearly stair;
6803,26,"or where god bacchus drains his cups divine,"
6804,26,"stretch'd out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine;"
6805,26,or where in pluto's gardens palatine
6806,26,"mulciber's columns gleam in far piazzian line,"
6807,26,and sometimes into cities she would send
6808,26,"her dream, with feast and rioting to blend;"
6809,26,"and once, while among mortals dreaming thus,"
6810,26,she saw the young corinthian lycius
6811,26,"charioting foremost in the envious race,"
6812,26,"like a young jove with calm uneager face,"
6813,26,"and fell into a swooning love of him,"
6814,26,now on the moth-time of that evening dim
6815,26,"he would return that way, as well she knew,"
6816,26,to corinth from the shore; for freshly blew
6817,26,"the eastern soft wind, and his galley now"
6818,26,grated the quaystones with her brazen prow
6819,26,"in port cenchreas, from egina isle"
6820,26,fresh anchor'd; whither he had been awhile
6821,26,"to sacrifice to jove, whose temple there"
6822,26,"waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare,"
6823,26,"jove heard his vows, and better'd his desire;"
6824,26,for by some freakful chance he made retire
6825,26,"from his companions, and set forth to walk,"
6826,26,"perhaps grown wearied of their corinth talk,"
6827,26,"over the solitary hills he fared,"
6828,26,"thoughtless at first, but ere eve's star appeared"
6829,26,"his phantasy was lost, where reason fades,"
6830,26,"in the calm'd twilight of platonic shades,"
6831,26,"lamia beheld him coming, near, more near -"
6832,26,"close to her passing, in indifference drear,"
6833,26,his silent sandals swept the mossy green;
6834,26,"so neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen"
6835,26,"she stood, he pass'd, shut up in mysteries,"
6836,26,"his mind wrapp'd like his mantle, while her eyes"
6837,26,"follow'd his steps, and her neck regal white"
6838,26,"turn'd - syllabling thus, ah, lycius bright,"
6839,26,and will you leave me on the hills alone?
6840,26,"lycius, look back! and be some pity shown,"
6841,26,"he did; not with cold wonder fearingly,"
6842,26,but orpheus-like at an eurydice;
6843,26,"for so delicious were the words she sung,"
6844,26,"it seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long,"
6845,26,"and soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up,"
6846,26,"leaving no drop in the bewildering cup,"
6847,26,"and still the cup was full, - while he afraid"
6848,26,lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid
6849,26,"due adoration, thus began to adore;"
6850,26,"her soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure,"
6851,26,"leave thee alone! look back! ah, goddess, see"
6852,26,whether my eyes can ever turn from thee!
6853,26,for pity do not this sad heart belie -
6854,26,"even as thou vanishest so i shall die,"
6855,26,"stay! though a naiad of the rivers, stay!"
6856,26,"to thy far wishes will thy streams obey,"
6857,26,"stay! though the greenest woods be thy domain,"
6858,26,"alone they can drink up the morning rain,"
6859,26,"though a descended pleiad, will not one"
6860,26,of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune
6861,26,"thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine?"
6862,26,so sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine
6863,26,"came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade"
6864,26,thy memory will waste me to a shade -
6865,26,"for pity do not melt! - if i should stay,"
6866,26,"said lamia, here, upon this floor of clay,"
6867,26,"and pain my steps upon these flowers too rough,"
6868,26,what canst thou say or do of charm enough
6869,26,to dull the nice remembrance of my home?
6870,26,thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam
6871,26,"over these hills and vales, where no joy is, -"
6872,26,empty of immortality and bliss!
6873,26,"thou art a scholar, lycius, and must know"
6874,26,that finer spirits cannot breathe below
6875,26,"in human climes, and live, alas! poor youth,"
6876,26,what taste of purer air hast thou to soothe
6877,26,"my essence? what serener palaces,"
6878,26,"where i may all my many senses please,"
6879,26,and by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease?
6880,26,"it cannot be - adieu! so said, she rose"
6881,26,"tiptoe with white arms spread, he, sick to lose"
6882,26,"the amorous promise of her lone complain,"
6883,26,"swoon'd, murmuring of love, and pale with pain,"
6884,26,"the cruel lady, without any show"
6885,26,"of sorrow for her tender favourite's woe,"
6886,26,"but rather, if her eyes could brighter be,"
6887,26,"with brighter eyes and slow amenity,"
6888,26,"put her new lips to his, and gave afresh"
6889,26,"the life she had so tangled in her mesh,"
6890,26,and as he from one trance was wakening
6891,26,"into another, she began to sing,"
6892,26,"happy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing,"
6893,26,"a song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres,"
6894,26,"while, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires"
6895,26,"and then she whisper'd in such trembling tone,"
6896,26,"as those who, safe together met alone"
6897,26,"for the first time through many anguish'd days,"
6898,26,use other speech than looks; bidding him raise
6899,26,"his drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt,"
6900,26,"for that she was a woman, and without"
6901,26,any more subtle fluid in her veins
6902,26,"than throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains"
6903,26,"inhabited her frail-strung heart as his,"
6904,26,and next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss
6905,26,"her face so long in corinth, where, she said,"
6906,26,"she dwelt but half retir'd, and there had led"
6907,26,days happy as the gold coin could invent
6908,26,without the aid of love; yet in content
6909,26,"till she saw him, as once she pass'd him by,"
6910,26,where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully
6911,26,"at venus' temple porch, 'mid baskets heap'd"
6912,26,"of amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap'd"
6913,26,"late on that eve, as 'twas the night before"
6914,26,"the adonian feast; whereof she saw no more,"
6915,26,"but wept alone those days, for why should she adore?"
6916,26,"lycius from death awoke into amaze,"
6917,26,"to see her still, and singing so sweet lays;"
6918,26,then from amaze into delight he fell
6919,26,to hear her whisper woman's lore so well;
6920,26,and every word she spake entic'd him on
6921,26,"to unperplex'd delight and pleasure known,"
6922,26,let the mad poets say whate'er they please
6923,26,"of the sweets of fairies, peris, goddesses,"
6924,26,"there is not such a treat among them all,"
6925,26,"haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall,"
6926,26,"as a real woman, lineal indeed"
6927,26,"from pyrrha's pebbles or old adam's seed,"
6928,26,"thus gentle lamia judg'd, and judg'd aright,"
6929,26,"that lycius could not love in half a fright,"
6930,26,"so threw the goddess off, and won his heart"
6931,26,"more pleasantly by playing woman's part,"
6932,26,"with no more awe than what her beauty gave,"
6933,26,"that, while it smote, still guaranteed to save,"
6934,26,"lycius to all made eloquent reply,"
6935,26,marrying to every word a twinborn sigh;
6936,26,"and last, pointing to corinth, ask'd her sweet,"
6937,26,"if 'twas too far that night for her soft feet,"
6938,26,"the way was short, for lamia's eagerness"
6939,26,"made, by a spell, the triple league decrease"
6940,26,to a few paces; not at all surmised
6941,26,"by blinded lycius, so in her comprized,"
6942,26,"they pass'd the city gates, he knew not how"
6943,26,"so noiseless, and he never thought to know,"
6944,26,
6945,26,"   as men talk in a dream, so corinth all,"
6946,26,"throughout her palaces imperial,"
6947,26,"and all her populous streets and temples lewd,"
6948,26,"mutter'd, like tempest in the distance brew'd,"
6949,26,"to the wide-spreaded night above her towers,"
6950,26,"men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours,"
6951,26,"shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white,"
6952,26,companion'd or alone; while many a light
6953,26,"flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals,"
6954,26,"and threw their moving shadows on the walls,"
6955,26,or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade
6956,26,"of some arch'd temple door, or dusky colonnade,"
6957,26,
6958,26,"   muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear,"
6959,26,"her fingers he press'd hard, as one came near"
6960,26,"with curl'd gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown,"
6961,26,"slow-stepp'd, and robed in philosophic gown,"
6962,26,"lycius shrank closer, as they met and past,"
6963,26,"into his mantle, adding wings to haste,"
6964,26,"while hurried lamia trembled, ah, said he,"
6965,26,"why do you shudder, love, so ruefully?"
6966,26,why does your tender palm dissolve in dew? -
6967,26,"i'm wearied, said fair lamia, tell me who"
6968,26,is that old man? i cannot bring to mind
6969,26,his features - lycius! wherefore did you blind
6970,26,"yourself from his quick eyes? lycius replied,"
6971,26,"'tis apollonius sage, my trusty guide"
6972,26,and good instructor; but to-night he seems
6973,26,"the ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams,"
6974,26,
6975,26,   while yet he spake they had arrived before
6976,26,"a pillar'd porch, with lofty portal door,"
6977,26,"where hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow"
6978,26,"reflected in the slabbed steps below,"
6979,26,"mild as a star in water; for so new,"
6980,26,"and so unsullied was the marble hue,"
6981,26,"so through the crystal polish, liquid fine,"
6982,26,"ran the dark veins, that none but feet divine"
6983,26,"could e'er have touch'd there, sounds aeolian"
6984,26,"breath'd from the hinges, as the ample span"
6985,26,of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown
6986,26,"some time to any, but those two alone,"
6987,26,"and a few persian mutes, who that same year"
6988,26,"were seen about the markets, none knew where"
6989,26,they could inhabit; the most curious
6990,26,"were foil'd, who watch'd to trace them to their house,"
6991,26,"and but the flitter-winged verse must tell,"
6992,26,"for truth's sake, what woe afterwards befel,"
6993,26,"'twould humour many a heart to leave them thus,"
6994,26,"shut from the busy world of more incredulous,"
6995,26,"love in a hut, with water and a crust,"
6996,26,"is - love, forgive us! - cinders, ashes, dust;"
6997,26,love in a palace is perhaps at last
6998,26,more grievous torment than a hermit's fast -
6999,26,"that is a doubtful tale from faery land,"
7000,26,"hard for the non-elect to understand,"
7001,26,"had lycius liv'd to hand his story down,"
7002,26,"he might have given the moral a fresh frown,"
7003,26,"or clench'd it quite, but too short was their bliss"
7004,26,"to breed distrust and hate, that make the soft voice hiss,"
7005,26,"besides, there, nightly, with terrific glare,"
7006,26,"love, jealous grown of so complete a pair,"
7007,26,"hover'd and buzz'd his wings, with fearful roar,"
7008,26,"above the lintel of their chamber door,"
7009,26,"and down the passage cast a glow upon the floor,"
7010,26,
7011,26,"   for all this came a ruin, side by side"
7012,26,"they were enthroned, in the even tide,"
7013,26,"upon a couch, near to a curtaining"
7014,26,"whose airy texture, from a golden string,"
7015,26,"floated into the room, and let appear"
7016,26,"unveil'd the summer heaven, blue and clear,"
7017,26,"betwixt two marble shafts, - there they reposed,"
7018,26,"where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed,"
7019,26,"saving a tythe which love still open kept,"
7020,26,that they might see each other while they almost slept;
7021,26,"when from the slope side of a suburb hill,"
7022,26,"deafening the swallow's twitter, came a thrill"
7023,26,"of trumpets - lycius started - the sounds fled,"
7024,26,"but left a thought, a buzzing in his head,"
7025,26,"for the first time, since first he harbour'd in"
7026,26,"that purple-lined palace of sweet sin,"
7027,26,his spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn
7028,26,"into the noisy world almost forsworn,"
7029,26,"the lady, ever watchful, penetrant,"
7030,26,"saw this with pain, so arguing a want"
7031,26,"of something more, more than her empery"
7032,26,of joys; and she began to moan and sigh
7033,26,"because he mused beyond her, knowing well"
7034,26,"that but a moment's thought is passion's passing bell,"
7035,26,"why do you sigh, fair creature? whisper'd he,"
7036,26,"why do you think? return'd she tenderly,"
7037,26,you have deserted me - where am i now?
7038,26,"not in your heart while care weighs on your brow,"
7039,26,"no, no, you have dismiss'd me; and i go"
7040,26,"from your breast houseless, ay, it must be so,"
7041,26,"he answer'd, bending to her open eyes,"
7042,26,"where he was mirror'd small in paradise,"
7043,26,"my silver planet, both of eve and morn!"
7044,26,"why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn,"
7045,26,while i am striving how to fill my heart
7046,26,"with deeper crimson, and a double smart?"
7047,26,"how to entangle, trammel up and snare"
7048,26,"your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there"
7049,26,like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?
7050,26,"ay, a sweet kiss - you see your mighty woes,"
7051,26,my thoughts! shall i unveil them? listen then!
7052,26,"what mortal hath a prize, that other men"
7053,26,"may be confounded and abash'd withal,"
7054,26,"but lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical,"
7055,26,"and triumph, as in thee i should rejoice"
7056,26,"amid the hoarse alarm of corinth's voice,"
7057,26,"let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar,"
7058,26,while through the thronged streets your bridal car
7059,26,"wheels round its dazzling spokes, the lady's cheek"
7060,26,"trembled; she nothing said, but, pale and meek,"
7061,26,"arose and knelt before him, wept a rain"
7062,26,of sorrows at his words; at last with pain
7063,26,"beseeching him, the while his hand she wrung,"
7064,26,"to change his purpose, he thereat was stung,"
7065,26,"perverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim"
7066,26,"her wild and timid nature to his aim,"
7067,26,"besides, for all his love, in self despite,"
7068,26,"against his better self, he took delight"
7069,26,"luxurious in her sorrows, soft and new,"
7070,26,"his passion, cruel grown, took on a hue"
7071,26,fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible
7072,26,"in one whose brow had no dark veins to swell,"
7073,26,"fine was the mitigated fury, like"
7074,26,apollo's presence when in act to strike
7075,26,"the serpent - ha, the serpent! certes, she"
7076,26,"was none, she burnt, she lov'd the tyranny,"
7077,26,"and, all subdued, consented to the hour"
7078,26,"when to the bridal he should lead his paramour,"
7079,26,"whispering in midnight silence, said the youth,"
7080,26,"sure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth,"
7081,26,"i have not ask'd it, ever thinking thee"
7082,26,"not mortal, but of heavenly progeny,"
7083,26,"as still i do, hast any mortal name,"
7084,26,fit appellation for this dazzling frame?
7085,26,"or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth,"
7086,26,to share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?
7087,26,"i have no friends, said lamia, no, not one;"
7088,26,"my presence in wide corinth hardly known,"
7089,26,my parents' bones are in their dusty urns
7090,26,"sepulchred, where no kindled incense burns,"
7091,26,"seeing all their luckless race are dead, save me,"
7092,26,"and i neglect the holy rite for thee,"
7093,26,even as you list invite your many guests;
7094,26,"but if, as now it seems, your vision rests"
7095,26,"with any pleasure on me, do not bid"
7096,26,"old apollonius - from him keep me hid,"
7097,26,"lycius, perplex'd at words so blind and blank,"
7098,26,"made close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank,"
7099,26,feigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade
7100,26,of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd
7101,26,
7102,26,   it was the custom then to bring away
7103,26,"the bride from home at blushing shut of day,"
7104,26,"veil'd, in a chariot, heralded along"
7105,26,"by strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song,"
7106,26,"with other pageants, but this fair unknown"
7107,26,"had not a friend, so being left alone,"
7108,26,lycius was gone to summon all his kin
7109,26,and knowing surely she could never win
7110,26,"his foolish heart from its mad pompousness,"
7111,26,"she set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress"
7112,26,"the misery in fit magnificence,"
7113,26,"she did so, but 'tis doubtful how and whence"
7114,26,"came, and who were her subtle servitors,"
7115,26,"about the halls, and to and from the doors,"
7116,26,"there was a noise of wings, till in short space"
7117,26,"the glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace,"
7118,26,"a haunting music, sole perhaps and lone"
7119,26,"supportress of the faery-roof, made moan"
7120,26,"throughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade,"
7121,26,"fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade"
7122,26,"of palm and plantain, met from either side,"
7123,26,"high in the midst, in honour of the bride,"
7124,26,"two palms and then two plantains, and so on,"
7125,26,from either side their stems branch'd one to one
7126,26,all down the aisled place; and beneath all
7127,26,"there ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall,"
7128,26,"so canopied, lay an untasted feast"
7129,26,"teeming with odours, lamia, regal drest,"
7130,26,"silently paced about, and as she went,"
7131,26,"in pale contented sort of discontent,"
7132,26,mission'd her viewless servants to enrich
7133,26,"the fretted splendour of each nook and niche,"
7134,26,"between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first,"
7135,26,"came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst"
7136,26,"forth creeping imagery of slighter trees,"
7137,26,"and with the larger wove in small intricacies,"
7138,26,"approving all, she faded at self-will,"
7139,26,"and shut the chamber up, close, hush'd and still,"
7140,26,"complete and ready for the revels rude,"
7141,26,"when dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude,"
7142,26,
7143,26,"   the day appear'd, and all the gossip rout,"
7144,26,o senseless lycius! madman! wherefore flout
7145,26,"the silent-blessing fate, warm cloister'd hours,"
7146,26,and show to common eyes these secret bowers?
7147,26,"the herd approach'd; each guest, with busy brain,"
7148,26,"arriving at the portal, gaz'd amain,"
7149,26,"and enter'd marveling, for they knew the street,"
7150,26,remember'd it from childhood all complete
7151,26,"without a gap, yet ne'er before had seen"
7152,26,"that royal porch, that high-built fair demesne;"
7153,26,"so in they hurried all, maz'd, curious and keen,"
7154,26,"save one, who look'd thereon with eye severe,"
7155,26,and with calm-planted steps walk'd in austere;
7156,26,"'twas apollonius, something too he laugh'd,"
7157,26,"as though some knotty problem, that had daft"
7158,26,"his patient thought, had now begun to thaw,"
7159,26,"and solve and melt - 'twas just as he foresaw,"
7160,26,
7161,26,   he met within the murmurous vestibule
7162,26,"his young disciple, 'tis no common rule,"
7163,26,"lycius, said he, for uninvited guest"
7164,26,"to force himself upon you, and infest"
7165,26,with an unbidden presence the bright throng
7166,26,"of younger friends; yet must i do this wrong,"
7167,26,"and you forgive me, lycius blush'd, and led"
7168,26,the old man through the inner doors broad-spread;
7169,26,with reconciling words and courteous mien
7170,26,"turning into sweet milk the sophist's spleen,"
7171,26,
7172,26,"   of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room,"
7173,26,"fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume,"
7174,26,before each lucid pannel fuming stood
7175,26,"a censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood,"
7176,26,"each by a sacred tripod held aloft,"
7177,26,whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft
7178,26,"wool-woofed carpets, fifty wreaths of smoke"
7179,26,from fifty censers their light voyage took
7180,26,"to the high roof, still mimick'd as they rose"
7181,26,"along the mirror'd walls by twin-clouds odorous,"
7182,26,"twelve sphered tables, by silk seats insphered,"
7183,26,high as the level of a man's breast rear'd
7184,26,"on libbard's paws, upheld the heavy gold"
7185,26,"of cups and goblets, and the store thrice told"
7186,26,"of ceres' horn, and, in huge vessels, wine"
7187,26,"come from the gloomy tun with merry shine,"
7188,26,"thus loaded with a feast the tables stood,"
7189,26,"each shrining in the midst the image of a god,"
7190,26,
7191,26,   when in an antichamber every guest
7192,26,"had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd,"
7193,26,"by minist'ring slaves, upon his hands and feet,"
7194,26,and fragrant oils with ceremony meet
7195,26,"pour'd on his hair, they all mov'd to the feast"
7196,26,"in white robes, and themselves in order placed"
7197,26,"around the silken couches, wondering"
7198,26,"whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring,"
7199,26,
7200,26,"   soft went the music the soft air along,"
7201,26,while fluent greek a vowel'd undersong
7202,26,kept up among the guests discoursing low
7203,26,"at first, for scarcely was the wine at flow;"
7204,26,"but when the happy vintage touch'd their brains,"
7205,26,"louder they talk, and louder come the strains"
7206,26,"of powerful instruments - the gorgeous dyes,"
7207,26,"the space, the splendour of the draperies,"
7208,26,"the roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer,"
7209,26,"beautiful slaves, and lamia's self, appear,"
7210,26,"now, when the wine has done its rosy deed,"
7211,26,"and every soul from human trammels freed,"
7212,26,"no more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine,"
7213,26,"will make elysian shades not too fair, too divine,"
7214,26,soon was god bacchus at meridian height;
7215,26,"flush'd were their cheeks, and bright eyes double bright,"
7216,26,"garlands of every green, and every scent"
7217,26,"from vales deflower'd, or forest-trees branch rent,"
7218,26,in baskets of bright osier'd gold were brought
7219,26,"high as the handles heap'd, to suit the thought"
7220,26,"of every guest; that each, as he did please,"
7221,26,"might fancy-fit his brows, silk-pillow'd at his ease,"
7222,26,
7223,26,   what wreath for lamia? what for lycius?
7224,26,"what for the sage, old apollonius?"
7225,26,upon her aching forehead be there hung
7226,26,the leaves of willow and of adder's tongue;
7227,26,"and for the youth, quick, let us strip for him"
7228,26,"the thyrsus, that his watching eyes may swim"
7229,26,"into forgetfulness; and, for the sage,"
7230,26,let spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage
7231,26,"war on his temples, do not all charms fly"
7232,26,at the mere touch of cold philosophy?
7233,26,"there was an awful rainbow once in heaven,"
7234,26,"we know her woof, her texture; she is given"
7235,26,"in the dull catalogue of common things,"
7236,26,"philosophy will clip an angel's wings,"
7237,26,"conquer all mysteries by rule and line,"
7238,26,"empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine -"
7239,26,"unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made"
7240,26,"the tender-person'd lamia melt into a shade,"
7241,26,
7242,26,"   by her glad lycius sitting, in chief place,"
7243,26,"scarce saw in all the room another face,"
7244,26,"till, checking his love trance, a cup he took"
7245,26,"full brimm'd, and opposite sent forth a look"
7246,26,"'cross the broad table, to beseech a glance"
7247,26,"from his old teacher's wrinkled countenance,"
7248,26,"and pledge him, the bald-head philosopher"
7249,26,"had fix'd his eye, without a twinkle or stir"
7250,26,"full on the alarmed beauty of the bride,"
7251,26,"brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride,"
7252,26,"lycius then press'd her hand, with devout touch,"
7253,26,"as pale it lay upon the rosy couch,"
7254,26,"'twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins;"
7255,26,"then sudden it grew hot, and all the pains"
7256,26,"of an unnatural heat shot to his heart,"
7257,26,"lamia, what means this? wherefore dost thou start?"
7258,26,"know'st thou that man? poor lamia answer'd not,"
7259,26,"he gaz'd into her eyes, and not a jot"
7260,26,"own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal,"
7261,26,"more, more he gaz'd, his human senses reel,"
7262,26,some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs;
7263,26,"there was no recognition in those orbs,"
7264,26,"lamia! he cried - and no soft-toned reply,"
7265,26,"the many heard, and the loud revelry"
7266,26,grew hush; the stately music no more breathes;
7267,26,"the myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths,"
7268,26,"by faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased;"
7269,26,"a deadly silence step by step increased,"
7270,26,"until it seem'd a horrid presence there,"
7271,26,"and not a man but felt the terror in his hair,"
7272,26,lamia! he shriek'd; and nothing but the shriek
7273,26,"with its sad echo did the silence break,"
7274,26,"begone, foul dream! he cried, gazing again"
7275,26,"in the bride's face, where now no azure vein"
7276,26,wander'd on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom
7277,26,misted the cheek; no passion to illume
7278,26,the deep-recessed vision - all was blight;
7279,26,"lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white,"
7280,26,"shut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man!"
7281,26,"turn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban"
7282,26,"of all the gods, whose dreadful images"
7283,26,"here represent their shadowy presences,"
7284,26,may pierce them on the sudden with the thorn
7285,26,"of painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn,"
7286,26,in trembling dotage to the feeblest fright
7287,26,"of conscience, for their long offended might,"
7288,26,"for all thine impious proud-heart sophistries,"
7289,26,"unlawful magic, and enticing lies,"
7290,26,corinthians! look upon that gray-beard wretch!
7291,26,"mark how, possess'd, his lashless eyelids stretch"
7292,26,"around his demon eyes! corinthians, see!"
7293,26,"my sweet bride withers at their potency,"
7294,26,"fool! said the sophist, in an under-tone"
7295,26,gruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan
7296,26,"from lycius answer'd, as heart-struck and lost,"
7297,26,"he sank supine beside the aching ghost,"
7298,26,"fool! fool! repeated he, while his eyes still"
7299,26,"relented not, nor mov'd; from every ill"
7300,26,"of life have i preserv'd thee to this day,"
7301,26,and shall i see thee made a serpent's prey?
7302,26,"then lamia breath'd death breath; the sophist's eye,"
7303,26,"like a sharp spear, went through her utterly,"
7304,26,"keen, cruel, perceant, stinging, she, as well"
7305,26,"as her weak hand could any meaning tell,"
7306,26,"motion'd him to be silent; vainly so,"
7307,26,he look'd and look'd again a level - no!
7308,26,"a serpent! echoed he; no sooner said,"
7309,26,"than with a frightful scream she vanished,"
7310,26,"and lycius' arms were empty of delight,"
7311,26,"as were his limbs of life, from that same night,"
7312,26,on the high couch he lay! - his friends came round
7313,26,"supported him - no pulse, or breath they found,"
7314,26,"and, in its marriage robe, the heavy body wound,"
7315,27,"unfelt unheard, unseen,"
7316,27,"     i've left my little queen,"
7317,27,"her languid arms in silver slumber lying,"
7318,27,"     ah! through their nestling touch,"
7319,27,     who---who could tell how much
7320,27,"there is for madness---cruel, or complying?"
7321,27,
7322,27,     those faery lids how sleek!
7323,27,"     those lips how moist!---they speak,"
7324,27,"in ripest quiet, shadows of sweet sounds,"
7325,27,     into my fancy's ear
7326,27,"     melting a burden dear,"
7327,27,"how love doth know no fullness, nor no bounds,"
7328,27,
7329,27,     true!---tender monitors!
7330,27,"     i bend unto your laws,"
7331,27,this sweetest day for dalliance was born!
7332,27,"     so, without more ado,"
7333,27,"     i'll feel my heaven anew,"
7334,27,"for all the blushing of the hasty morn,"
7335,28,"souls of poets dead and gone,"
7336,28,"    what elysium have ye known,"
7337,28,"    happy field or mossy cavern,"
7338,28,    choicer than the mermaid tavern?
7339,28,    have ye tippled drink more fine
7340,28,    than mine host's canary wine?
7341,28,    or are fruits of paradise
7342,28,    sweeter than those dainty pies
7343,28,    of venison? o generous food!
7344,28,    drest as though bold robin hood
7345,28,"    would, with his maid marian,"
7346,28,"    sup and bowse from horn and can,"
7347,28,
7348,28,        i have heard that on a day
7349,28,"    mine host's sign-board flew away,"
7350,28,"    nobody knew whither, till"
7351,28,    an astrologer's old quill
7352,28,"    to a sheepskin gave the story,"
7353,28,"    said he saw you in your glory,"
7354,28,    underneath a new old sign
7355,28,"    sipping beverage divine,"
7356,28,    and pledging with contented smack
7357,28,"    the mermaid in the zodiac,"
7358,28,
7359,28,"        souls of poets dead and gone,"
7360,28,"    what elysium have ye known,"
7361,28,"    happy field or mossy cavern,"
7362,28,    choicer than the mermaid tavern?
7363,29,old meg she was a gypsy;
7364,29,"     and liv'd upon the moors,"
7365,29,"her bed it was the brown heath turf,"
7366,29,"     and her house was out of doors,"
7367,29,
7368,29,"her apples were swart blackberries,"
7369,29,"     her currants, pods o' broom;"
7370,29,"her wine was dew of the wild white rose,"
7371,29,"     her book a church-yard tomb,"
7372,29,
7373,29,"her brothers were the craggy hills,"
7374,29,     her sisters larchen trees;
7375,29,alone with her great family
7376,29,"     she liv'd as she did please,"
7377,29,
7378,29,"no breakfast had she many a morn,"
7379,29,"     no dinner many a noon,"
7380,29,and 'stead of supper she would stare
7381,29,"     full hard against the moon,"
7382,29,
7383,29,"but every morn, of woodbine fresh"
7384,29,"     she made her garlanding,"
7385,29,and every night the dark glen yew
7386,29,"     she wove, and she would sing,"
7387,29,
7388,29,and with her fingers old and brown
7389,29,"     she plaited mats o' rushes,"
7390,29,and gave them to the cottagers
7391,29,"     she met among the bushes,"
7392,29,
7393,29,"old meg was brave as margaret queen,"
7394,29,"     and tall as amazon,"
7395,29,"an old red blanket cloak she wore,"
7396,29,"     a chip hat had she on,"
7397,29,god rest her aged bones somewhere---
7398,29,     she died full long agone!
7399,30,o blush not so! o blush not so!
7400,30,     or i shall think you knowing;
7401,30,"and if you smile the blushing while,"
7402,30,"     then maidenheads are going,"
7403,30,
7404,30,"there's a blush for want, and a blush for shan't,"
7405,30,     and a blush for having done it;
7406,30,"there's a blush for thought, and a blush for nought,"
7407,30,"     and a blush for just begun it,"
7408,30,
7409,30,o sigh not so! o sigh not so!
7410,30,     for it sounds of eve's sweet pippin;
7411,30,by these loosen'd lips you have tasted the pips
7412,30,"     and fought in an amorous nipping,"
7413,30,
7414,30,"will you play once more at nice-cut-core,"
7415,30,"     for it only will last our youth out,"
7416,30,"and we have the prime of the kissing time,"
7417,30,"     we have not one sweet tooth out,"
7418,30,
7419,30,"there's a sigh for aye, and a sigh for nay,"
7420,30,     and a sigh for i can't bear it!
7421,30,"o what can be done, shall we stay or run?"
7422,30,     o cut the sweet apple and share it!
7423,31,"o solitude! if i must with thee dwell,"
7424,31,let it not be among the jumbled heap
7425,31,"of murky buildings, climb with me the steep,—"
7426,31,"nature's observatory—whence the dell,"
7427,31,"in flowery slopes, its river's crystal swell,"
7428,31,may seem a span; let me thy vigils keep
7429,31,"'mongst boughs pavilioned, where the deer's swift leap"
7430,31,"startles the wild bee from the foxglove bell,"
7431,31,"but though i'll gladly trace these scenes with thee,"
7432,31,"yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind,"
7433,31,"whose words are images of thoughts refined,"
7434,31,is my soul's pleasure; and it sure must be
7435,31,"almost the highest bliss of human-kind,"
7436,31,"when to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee,"
7437,32,"thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,"
7438,32,"      thou foster-child of silence and slow time,"
7439,32,"  sylvan historian, who canst thus express"
7440,32,"      a flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme,"
7441,32,  what leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
7442,32,"      of deities or mortals, or of both,"
7443,32,          in tempe or the dales of arcady?
7444,32,      what men or gods are these? what maidens loth?
7445,32,  what mad pursuit? what struggle to escape?
7446,32,          what pipes and timbrels? what wild ecstasy?
7447,32,
7448,32,"  heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard"
7449,32,"      are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;"
7450,32,"  not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,"
7451,32,"      pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone,"
7452,32,"  fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave"
7453,32,"      thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;"
7454,32,"          bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss,"
7455,32,"  though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;"
7456,32,"      she cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,"
7457,32,"          for ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!"
7458,32,
7459,32,"  ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed"
7460,32,"      your leaves, nor ever bid the spring adieu;"
7461,32,"  and, happy melodist, unwearied,"
7462,32,      for ever piping songs for ever new;
7463,32,"  more happy love! more happy, happy love!"
7464,32,"      for ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,"
7465,32,"          for ever panting, and for ever young;"
7466,32,"  all breathing human passion far above,"
7467,32,"      that leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,"
7468,32,"          a burning forehead, and a parching tongue,"
7469,32,
7470,32,  who are these coming to the sacrifice?
7471,32,"      to what green altar, o mysterious priest,"
7472,32,"  lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,"
7473,32,      and all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
7474,32,"  what little town by river or sea shore,"
7475,32,"      or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,"
7476,32,"          is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?"
7477,32,"  and, little town, thy streets for evermore"
7478,32,      will silent be; and not a soul to tell
7479,32,"          why thou art desolate, can e'er return,"
7480,32,
7481,32,  o attic shape! fair attitude! with brede
7482,32,"      of marble men and maidens overwrought,"
7483,32,  with forest branches and the trodden weed;
7484,32,"      thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought"
7485,32,"  as doth eternity, cold pastoral!"
7486,32,"      when old age shall this generation waste,"
7487,32,"          thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe"
7488,32,"  than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,"
7489,32,"      beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is all"
7490,32,"          ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,"
7491,33,"one morn before me were three figures seen,"
7492,33,"    i with bowed necks, and joined hands, side-faced;"
7493,33,"and one behind the other stepp'd serene,"
7494,33,"    in placid sandals, and in white robes graced;"
7495,33,"they pass'd, like figures on a marble urn,"
7496,33,    when shifted round to see the other side;
7497,33,         they came again; as when the urn once more
7498,33,"is shifted round, the first seen shades return;"
7499,33,"    and they were strange to me, as may betide"
7500,33,"         with vases, to one deep in phidian lore,"
7501,33,
7502,33,"how is it, shadows! that i knew ye not?"
7503,33,    how came ye muffled in so hush a masque?
7504,33,was it a silent deep-disguised plot
7505,33,"    to steal away, and leave without a task"
7506,33,my idle days? ripe was the drowsy hour;
7507,33,    the blissful cloud of summer-indolence
7508,33,         benumb'd my eyes; my pulse grew less and less;
7509,33,"pain had no sting, and pleasure's wreath no flower,"
7510,33,"    o, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense"
7511,33,         unhaunted quite of all but---nothingness?
7512,33,
7513,33,a third time came they by;---alas! wherefore?
7514,33,    my sleep had been embroider'd with dim dreams;
7515,33,my soul had been a lawn besprinkled o'er
7516,33,"    with flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams,"
7517,33,"the morn was clouded, but no shower fell,"
7518,33,    tho' in her lids hung the sweet tears of may;
7519,33,"         the open casement press'd a new-leav'd vine,"
7520,33,let in the budding warmth and throstle's lay;
7521,33,    o shadows! 'twas a time to bid farewell!
7522,33,"         upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine,"
7523,33,
7524,33,"a third time pass'd they by, and, passing, turn'd"
7525,33,    each one the face a moment whiles to me;
7526,33,"then faded, and to follow them i burn'd"
7527,33,"    and ached for wings, because i knew the three;"
7528,33,"the first was a fair maid, and love her name;"
7529,33,"    the second was ambition, pale of cheek,"
7530,33,         and ever watchful with fatigued eye;
7531,33,"the last, whom i love more, the more of blame"
7532,33,"    is heap'd upon her, maiden most unmeek,---"
7533,33,"         i knew to be my demon poesy,"
7534,33,
7535,33,"they faded, and, forsooth! i wanted wings,"
7536,33,    o folly! what is love! and where is it?
7537,33,and for that poor ambition---it springs
7538,33,    from a man's little heart's short fever-fit;
7539,33,"for poesy!---no,---she has not a joy,---"
7540,33,"    at least for me,---so sweet as drowsy noons,"
7541,33,         and evenings steep'd in honied indolence;
7542,33,"o, for an age so shelter'd from annoy,"
7543,33,"    that i may never know how change the moons,"
7544,33,         or hear the voice of busy common-sense!
7545,33,
7546,33,"so, ye three ghosts, adieu! ye cannot raise"
7547,33,    my head cool-bedded in the flowery grass;
7548,33,"for i would not be dieted with praise,"
7549,33,    a pet-lamb in a sentimental farce!
7550,33,"fade sofdy from my eyes, and be once more"
7551,33,    in masque-like figures on the dreamy urn;
7552,33,"         farewell! i yet have visions for the night,"
7553,33,and for the day faint visions there is store;
7554,33,"    vanish, ye phantoms! from my idle spright,"
7555,33,"         into the clouds, and never more return!"
7556,34,"no, no! go not to lethe, neither twist"
7557,34,"    wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;"
7558,34,nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kissed
7559,34,"    by nightshade, ruby grape of proserpine;"
7560,34,"make not your rosary of yew-berries,"
7561,34,    nor let the beetle nor the death-moth be
7562,34,"         your mournful psyche, nor the downy owl"
7563,34,a partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
7564,34,"    for shade to shade will come too drowsily,"
7565,34,"         and drown the wakeful anguish of the soul,"
7566,34,
7567,34,but when the melancholy fit shall fall
7568,34,"    sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,"
7569,34,"that fosters the droop-headed flowers all,"
7570,34,    and hides the green hill in an april shroud;
7571,34,"then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,"
7572,34,"    or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,"
7573,34,         or on the wealth of globed peonies;
7574,34,"or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,"
7575,34,"    emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,"
7576,34,"         and feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes,"
7577,34,
7578,34,she dwells with beauty -- beauty that must die;
7579,34,"    and joy, whose hand is ever at his lips"
7580,34,"bidding adieu; and aching pleasure nigh,"
7581,34,    turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips;
7582,34,"ay, in the very temple of delight"
7583,34,"    veiled melancholy has her sovran shrine,"
7584,34,         though seen of none save him whose strenuous
7585,34,         tongue
7586,34,    can burst joy's grape against his palate fine;
7587,34,"his soul shall taste the sadness of her might,"
7588,34,"         and be among her cloudy trophies hung,"
7589,35,"my heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains"
7590,35,"    my sense, as though of hemlock i had drunk,"
7591,35,or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
7592,35,"    one minute past, and lethe-wards had sunk,"
7593,35,"'tis not through envy of thy happy lot,"
7594,35,"    but being too happy in thy happiness,---"
7595,35,"         that thou, light-winged dryad of the trees,"
7596,35,              in some melodious plot
7597,35,"    of beechen green, and shadows numberless,"
7598,35,"         singest of summer in full-throated ease,"
7599,35,
7600,35,"o for a draught of vintage, that hath been"
7601,35,"    cooled a long age in the deep-delved earth,"
7602,35,"tasting of flora and the country green,"
7603,35,"    dance, and provencal song, and sun-burnt mirth!"
7604,35,"o for a beaker full of the warm south,"
7605,35,"    full of the true, the blushful hippocrene,"
7606,35,"         with beaded bubbles winking at the brim,"
7607,35,              and purple-stained mouth;
7608,35,"    that i might drink, and leave the world unseen,"
7609,35,"         and with thee fade away into the forest dim,"
7610,35,
7611,35,"fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget"
7612,35,"    what thou among the leaves hast never known,"
7613,35,"the weariness, the fever, and the fret"
7614,35,"    here, where men sit and hear each other groan;"
7615,35,"where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,"
7616,35,"    where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;"
7617,35,         where but to think is to be full of sorrow
7618,35,              and leaden-eyed despairs;
7619,35,"    where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,"
7620,35,"         or new love pine at them beyond tomorrow,"
7621,35,
7622,35,"away! away! for i will fly to thee,"
7623,35,"    not charioted by bacchus and his pards,"
7624,35,"but on the viewless wings of poesy,"
7625,35,"    though the dull brain perplexes and retards,"
7626,35,"already with thee! tender is the night,"
7627,35,"    and haply the queen-moon is on her throne,"
7628,35,         clustered around by all her starry fays;
7629,35,"              but here there is no light,"
7630,35,    save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
7631,35,"         through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways,"
7632,35,
7633,35,"i cannot see what flowers are at my feet,"
7634,35,"    nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,"
7635,35,"but, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet"
7636,35,    wherewith the seasonable month endows
7637,35,"the grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;"
7638,35,"    white hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;"
7639,35,         fast-fading violets covered up in leaves;
7640,35,"              and mid-may's eldest child,"
7641,35,"    the coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,"
7642,35,"         the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves,"
7643,35,
7644,35,darkling i listen; and for many a time
7645,35,"    i have been half in love with easeful death,"
7646,35,"called him soft names in many a mused rhyme,"
7647,35,    to take into the air my quiet breath;
7648,35,"now more than ever seems it rich to die,"
7649,35,"    to cease upon the midnight with no pain,"
7650,35,         while thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
7651,35,              in such an ecstasy!
7652,35,"    still wouldst thou sing, and i have ears in vain---"
7653,35,         to thy high requiem become a sod
7654,35,
7655,35,"thou wast not born for death, immortal bird!"
7656,35,    no hungry generations tread thee down;
7657,35,the voice i hear this passing night was heard
7658,35,"    in ancient days by emperor and clown,"
7659,35,perhaps the self-same song that found a path
7660,35,"    through the sad heart of ruth, when, sick for home,"
7661,35,         she stood in tears amid the alien corn;
7662,35,              the same that oft-times hath
7663,35,"    charmed magic casements, opening on the foam"
7664,35,"         of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn,"
7665,35,
7666,35,forlorn! the very word is like a bell
7667,35,    to toll me back from thee to my sole self!
7668,35,adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
7669,35,"    as she is famed to do, deceiving elf,"
7670,35,adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
7671,35,"    past the near meadows, over the still stream,"
7672,35,         up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
7673,35,"              in the next valley-glades,"
7674,35,"    was it a vision, or a waking dream?"
7675,35,"         fled is that music,---do i wake or sleep?"
7676,36,in thy western halls of gold
7677,36,"when thou sittest in thy state,"
7678,36,"bards, that erst sublimely told"
7679,36,"heroic deeds, and sang of fate,"
7680,36,"with fervour seize their adamantine lyres,"
7681,36,"whose chords are solid rays, and twinkle radiant fires,"
7682,36,
7683,36,here homer with his nervous arms
7684,36,"strikes the twanging harp of war,"
7685,36,"and even the western splendour warms,"
7686,36,"while the trumpets sound afar,"
7687,36,"but, what creates the most intense surprise,"
7688,36,"his soul looks out through renovated eyes,"
7689,36,
7690,36,"then, through thy temple wide, melodious swells"
7691,36,"the sweet majestic tone of maro's lyre,"
7692,36,"the soul delighted on each accent dwells, -"
7693,36,"enraptur'd dwells, - not daring to respire,"
7694,36,"the while he tells of grief around a funeral pyre,"
7695,36,
7696,36,'tis awful silence then again;
7697,36,expectant stand the spheres;
7698,36,"breathless the laurell'd peers,"
7699,36,"nor move, till ends the lofty strain,"
7700,36,"nor move till milton's tuneful thunders cease,"
7701,36,"and leave once more the ravish'd heavens in peace,"
7702,36,
7703,36,"thou biddest shakespeare wave his hand,"
7704,36,and quickly forward spring
7705,36,the passions - a terrific band -
7706,36,and each vibrates the string
7707,36,"that with its tyrant temper best accords,"
7708,36,"while from their master's lips pour forth the inspiring words,"
7709,36,
7710,36,"a silver trumpet spenser blows,"
7711,36,"and, as its martial notes to silence flee,"
7712,36,from a virgin chorus flows
7713,36,"a hymn in praise of spotless chastity,"
7714,36,'tis still! wild warblings from the aeolian lyre
7715,36,"enchantment softly breathe, and tremblingly expire,"
7716,36,
7717,36,next thy tasso's ardent numbers
7718,36,"float along the pleased air,"
7719,36,"calling youth from idle slumbers,"
7720,36,"rousing them from pleasure's lair, -"
7721,36,"then o'er the strings his fingers gently move,"
7722,36,"and melt the soul to pity and to love,"
7723,36,
7724,36,"but when thou joinest with the nine,"
7725,36,"and all the powers of song combine,"
7726,36,"we listen here on earth,"
7727,36,"thy dying tones that fill the air,"
7728,36,"and charm the ear of evening fair,"
7729,36,"from thee, great god of bards,"
7730,36,"receive their heavenly birth,"
7731,37,"season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,"
7732,37,       close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
7733,37,   conspiring with him how to load and bless
7734,37,       with fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
7735,37,"   to bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,"
7736,37,       and fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
7737,37,"          to swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells"
7738,37,"       with a sweet kernel; to set budding more,"
7739,37,"   and still more, later flowers for the bees,"
7740,37,"  until they think warm days will never cease,"
7741,37,"         for summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells,"
7742,37,
7743,37,  who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
7744,37,      sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
7745,37,"  thee sitting careless on a granary floor,"
7746,37,      thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
7747,37,"  or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,"
7748,37,"      drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook"
7749,37,"         spares the next swath and all its twined flowers,"
7750,37,  and sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
7751,37,      steady thy laden head across a brook;
7752,37,"      or by a cyder-press, with patient look,"
7753,37,"         thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours,"
7754,37,
7755,37,"  where are the songs of spring? ay, where are they?"
7756,37,"      think not of them, thou hast thy music too,--"
7757,37,"  while barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,"
7758,37,      and touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
7759,37,  then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
7760,37,"      among the river sallows, borne aloft"
7761,37,         or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
7762,37,  and full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
7763,37,      hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
7764,37,      the red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
7765,37,"         and gathering swallows twitter in the skies,"
7766,38,physician nature! let my spirit blood!
7767,38,  o ease my heart of verse and let me rest;
7768,38,"throw me upon thy tripod, till the flood"
7769,38,"  of stifling numbers ebbs from my full breast,"
7770,38,a theme! a theme! great nature! give a theme;
7771,38,"let me begin my dream,"
7772,38,"i come -- i see thee, as thou standest there,"
7773,38,"beckon me not into the wintry air,"
7774,38,
7775,38,"ah! dearest love, sweet home of all my fears,"
7776,38,"  and hopes, and joys, and panting miseries, --"
7777,38,"to-night, if i may guess, thy beauty wears"
7778,38,"a smile of such delight,"
7779,38,"as brilliant and as bright,"
7780,38,"as when with ravished, aching, vassal eyes,"
7781,38,"lost in soft amaze,"
7782,38,"i gaze, i gaze!"
7783,38,
7784,38,"who now, with greedy looks, eats up my feast?"
7785,38,  what stare outfaces now my silver moon!
7786,38,ah! keep that hand unravished at the least;
7787,38,"let, let, the amorous burn --"
7788,38,"but pr'ythee, do not turn"
7789,38,"the current of your heart from me so soon,"
7790,38,"o! save, in charity,"
7791,38,"the quickest pulse for me,"
7792,38,
7793,38,"save it for me, sweet love! though music breathe"
7794,38,  voluptuous visions into the warm air;
7795,38,"though swimming through the dance's dangerous wreath,"
7796,38,"be like an april day,"
7797,38,"smiling and cold and gay,"
7798,38,"a temperate lilly, temperate as fair;"
7799,38,"then, heaven! there will be"
7800,38,"a warmer june for me,"
7801,38,
7802,38,"why, this, you'll say, my fanny! is not true,"
7803,38,"  put your soft hand upon your snowy side,"
7804,38,"where the heart beats, confess -- 'tis nothing new --"
7805,38,must not a woman be
7806,38,"a feather on the sea,"
7807,38,sway'd to and fro by every wind and tide?
7808,38,of as uncertain speed
7809,38,as blow-ball from the mead?
7810,38,
7811,38,i know it -- and to know it is despair
7812,38,"  to one who loves you as i love, sweet fanny!"
7813,38,"whose heart goes fluttering for you every where,"
7814,38,"nor, when away you roam,"
7815,38,"dare keep its wretched home,"
7816,38,"love, love alone, his pains severe and many,"
7817,38,"then, loveliest! keep me free,"
7818,38,"from torturing jealousy,"
7819,38,
7820,38,ah! if you prize my subdued soul above
7821,38,"  the poor, the fading, brief, pride of an hour;"
7822,38,"let none profane my holy see of love,"
7823,38,or with a rude hand break
7824,38,"the sacramental cake,"
7825,38,let none else touch the just new-budded flower;
7826,38,"if not -- may my eyes close,"
7827,38,"love! on their lost repose,"
7828,39,"o goddess! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung"
7829,39,"    by sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,"
7830,39,  and pardon that thy secrets should be sung
7831,39,"    even into thine own soft-conched ear,"
7832,39,"  surely i dreamt to-day, or did i see"
7833,39,    the winged psyche with awaken'd eyes?
7834,39,"  i wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly,"
7835,39,"    and, on the sudden, fainting with surprise,"
7836,39,"  saw two fair creatures, couched side by side"
7837,39,"    in deepest grass, beneath the whisp'ring roof"
7838,39,"    of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran"
7839,39,"       a brooklet, scarce espied,"
7840,39,
7841,39,"  mid hush'd, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed,"
7842,39,"      blue, silver-white, and budded tyrian,"
7843,39,"  they lay calm-breathing, on the bedded grass;"
7844,39,"      their arms embraced, and their pinions too;"
7845,39,"      their lips touch'd not, but had not bade adieu,"
7846,39,"  as if disjoined by soft-handed slumber,"
7847,39,  and ready still past kisses to outnumber
7848,39,"      at tender eye-dawn of aurorean love,"
7849,39,          the winged boy i knew;
7850,39,"  but who wast thou, o happy, happy dove?"
7851,39,          his psyche true!
7852,39,
7853,39,  o latest born and loveliest vision far
7854,39,      of all olympus' faded hierarchy!
7855,39,"  fairer than ph{oe}be's sapphire-region'd star,"
7856,39,"      or vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky;"
7857,39,"  fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,"
7858,39,          nor altar heap'd with flowers;
7859,39,  nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan
7860,39,          upon the midnight hours;
7861,39,"  no voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet"
7862,39,      from chain-swung censer teeming;
7863,39,"  no shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat"
7864,39,"      of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming,"
7865,39,
7866,39,"  o brightest! though too late for antique vows,"
7867,39,"      too, too late for the fond believing lyre,"
7868,39,"  when holy were the haunted forest boughs,"
7869,39,"      holy the air, the water, and the fire;"
7870,39,  yet even in these days so far retir'd
7871,39,"      from happy pieties, thy lucent fans,"
7872,39,"      fluttering among the faint olympians,"
7873,39,"  i see, and sing, by my own eyes inspir'd,"
7874,39,"  so let me be thy choir, and make a moan"
7875,39,          upon the midnight hours;
7876,39,"  thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet"
7877,39,      from swinged censer teeming;
7878,39,"  thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat"
7879,39,"      of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming,"
7880,39,
7881,39,"  yes, i will be thy priest, and build a fane"
7882,39,"      in some untrodden region of my mind,"
7883,39,"  where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain,"
7884,39,"      instead of pines shall murmur in the wind,"
7885,39,"  far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees"
7886,39,      fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep;
7887,39,"  and there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,"
7888,39,      the moss-lain dryads shall be lull'd to sleep;
7889,39,  and in the midst of this wide quietness
7890,39,  a rosy sanctuary will i dress
7891,39,"    with the wreath'd trellis of a working brain,"
7892,39,"      with buds, and bells, and stars without a name,"
7893,39,"  with all the gardener fancy e'er could feign,"
7894,39,"      who breeding flowers, will never breed the same,"
7895,39,  and there shall be for thee all soft delight
7896,39,"      that shadowy thought can win,"
7897,39,"  a bright torch, and a casement ope at night,"
7898,39,      to let the warm love in!
7899,40,"i,"
7900,40,
7901,40,"fame, like a wayward girl, will still be coy"
7902,40,"to those who woo her with too slavish knees,"
7903,40,"but makes surrender to some thoughtless boy,"
7904,40,and dotes the more upon a heart at ease;
7905,40,"she is a gypsy,--will not speak to those"
7906,40,who have not learnt to be content without her;
7907,40,"a jilt, whose ear was never whisper'd close,"
7908,40,who thinks they scandal her who talk about her;
7909,40,"a very gypsy is she, nilus-born,"
7910,40,sister-in-law to jealous potiphar;
7911,40,ye love-sick bards! repay her scorn for scorn;
7912,40,ye artists lovelorn! madmen that ye are!
7913,40,"make your best bow to her and bid adieu,"
7914,40,"then, if she likes it, she will follow you,"
7915,40,
7916,40,"ii,"
7917,40,
7918,40,"you cannot eat your cake and have it too,--proverb,"
7919,40,
7920,40,"how fever'd is the man, who cannot look"
7921,40,"upon his mortal days with temperate blood,"
7922,40,"who vexes all the leaves of his life's book,"
7923,40,and robs his fair name of its maidenhood;
7924,40,"it is as if the rose should pluck herself,"
7925,40,"on the ripe plum finger its misty bloom,"
7926,40,"as if a naiad, like a meddling elf,"
7927,40,"should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom,"
7928,40,"but the rose leaves herself upon the briar,"
7929,40,"for winds to kiss and grateful bees to feed,"
7930,40,"and the ripe plum still wears its dim attire,"
7931,40,the undisturbed lake has crystal space;
7932,40,"why then should man, teasing the world for grace,"
7933,40,spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed?
7934,41,"much have i travell'd in the realms of gold,"
7935,41,        and many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
7936,41,        round many western islands have i been
7937,41,"    which bards in fealty to apollo hold,"
7938,41,    oft of one wide expanse had i been told
7939,41,        that deep-brow'd homer ruled as his demesne;
7940,41,        yet did i never breathe its pure serene
7941,41,"    till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold,"
7942,41,    then felt i like some watcher of the skies
7943,41,        when a new planet swims into his ken;
7944,41,    or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes
7945,41,        he star'd at the pacific--and all his men
7946,41,    look'd at each other with a wild surmise--
7947,41,"        silent, upon a peak in darien,"
7948,42,"give me a golden pen, and let me lean"
7949,42,"on heaped-up flowers, in regions clear, and far;"
7950,42,"bring me a tablet whiter than a star,"
7951,42,"or hand of hymning angel, when 'tis seen"
7952,42,"the silver strings of heavenly harp atween,"
7953,42,and let there glide by many a pearly car
7954,42,"pink robes, and wavy hair, and diamond jar,"
7955,42,"and half-discovered wings, and glances keen,"
7956,42,"the while let music wander round my ears,"
7957,42,"and as it reaches each delicious ending,"
7958,42,"let me write down a line of glorious tone,"
7959,42,"and full of many wonders of the spheres,"
7960,42,for what a height my spirit is contending!
7961,42,"'tis not content so soon to be alone,"
7962,43,my spirit is too weak; mortality
7963,43,"weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,"
7964,43,and each imagined pinnacle and steep
7965,43,of godlike hardship tells me i must die
7966,43,"like a sick eagle looking at the sky,"
7967,43,"yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep,"
7968,43,that i have not the cloudy winds to keep
7969,43,"fresh for the opening of the morning's eye,"
7970,43,such dim-conceived glories of the brain
7971,43,bring round the heart an indescribable feud;
7972,43,"so do these wonders a most dizzy pain,"
7973,43,that mingles grecian grandeur with the rude
7974,43,"wasting of old time -with a billowy main,"
7975,43,"a sun, a shadow of a magnitude,"
7976,44,o golden-tongued romance with serene lute!
7977,44,        fair plumed syren! queen of far away!
7978,44,"        leave melodizing on this wintry day,"
7979,44,"    shut up thine olden pages, and be mute,"
7980,44,"    adieu! for once again the fierce dispute,"
7981,44,        betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay
7982,44,        must i burn through; once more humbly assay
7983,44,"    the bitter-sweet of this shakespearian fruit,"
7984,44,"    chief poet! and ye clouds of albion,"
7985,44,"        begetters of our deep eternal theme,"
7986,44,"    when through the old oak forest i am gone,"
7987,44,"        let me not wander in a barren dream,"
7988,44,"    but when i am consumed in the fire,"
7989,44,"    give me new phoenix wings to fly at my desire,"
7990,45,"the poetry of earth is never dead,"
7991,45,"when all the birds are faint with the hot sun,"
7992,45,"and hide in cooling trees, a voice will run"
7993,45,from hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
7994,45,that is the grasshopper's--he takes the lead
7995,45,"in summer luxury,--he has never done"
7996,45,with his delights; for when tired out with fun
7997,45,"he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed,"
7998,45,"the poetry of earth is ceasing never,"
7999,45,"on a lone winter evening, when the frost"
8000,45,"has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills"
8001,45,"the cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,"
8002,45,"and seems to one in drowsiness half lost,"
8003,45,"the grasshopper's among some grassy hills,"
8004,46,it keeps eternal whisperings around
8005,46,"desolate shores, and with its mighty swell"
8006,46,"gluts twice ten thousand caverns, till the spell"
8007,46,"of hecate leaves them their old shadowy sound,"
8008,46,"often 'tis in such gentle temper found,"
8009,46,that scarcely will the very smallest shell
8010,46,"be moved for days from where it sometime fell,"
8011,46,"when last the winds of heaven were unbound,"
8012,46,"oh, ye! who have your eyeballs vexed and tired,"
8013,46,feast them upon the wideness of the sea;
8014,46,"oh ye! whose ears are dinned with uproar rude,"
8015,46,or fed too much with cloying melody---
8016,46,"sit ye near some old cavern's mouth and brood,"
8017,46,"until ye start, as if the sea nymphs quired!"
8018,47,"no! those days are gone away,"
8019,47,"and their hours are old and gray,"
8020,47,and their minutes buried all
8021,47,under the down-trodden pall
8022,47,"of the leaves of many years,"
8023,47,"many times have winter's shears,"
8024,47,"frozen north, and chilling east,"
8025,47,sounded tempests to the feast
8026,47,"of the forest's whispering fleeces,"
8027,47,"since men knew nor rent nor leases,"
8028,47,
8029,47,"     no, the bugle sounds no more,"
8030,47,and the twanging bow no more;
8031,47,silent is the ivory shrill
8032,47,past the heath and up the hill;
8033,47,"there is no mid-forest laugh,"
8034,47,where lone echo gives the half
8035,47,"to some wight, amaz'd to hear"
8036,47,"jesting, deep in forest drear,"
8037,47,
8038,47,     on the fairest time of june
8039,47,"you may go, with sun or moon,"
8040,47,"or the seven stars to light you,"
8041,47,or the polar ray to right you;
8042,47,but you never may behold
8043,47,"little john, or robin bold;"
8044,47,"never one, of all the clan,"
8045,47,thrumming on an empty can
8046,47,"some old hunting ditty, while"
8047,47,he doth his green way beguile
8048,47,"to fair hostess merriment,"
8049,47,down beside the pasture trent;
8050,47,"for he left the merry tale,"
8051,47,"messenger for spicy ale,"
8052,47,
8053,47,"     gone, the merry morris din;"
8054,47,"gone, the song of gamelyn;"
8055,47,"gone, the tough-belted outlaw"
8056,47,idling in the grene shawe;
8057,47,all are gone away and past!
8058,47,and if robin should be cast
8059,47,"sudden from his turfed grave,"
8060,47,and if marian should have
8061,47,"once again her forest days,"
8062,47,"she would weep, and he would craze,"
8063,47,"he would swear, for all his oaks,"
8064,47,"fall'n beneath the dockyard strokes,"
8065,47,have rotted on the briny seas;
8066,47,she would weep that her wild bees
8067,47,sang not to her---strange! that honey
8068,47,can't be got without hard money!
8069,47,
8070,47,     so it is; yet let us sing
8071,47,honour to the old bow-string!
8072,47,honour to the bugle-horn!
8073,47,honour to the woods unshorn!
8074,47,honour to the lincoln green!
8075,47,honour to the archer keen!
8076,47,"honour to tight little john,"
8077,47,and the horse he rode upon!
8078,47,"honour to bold robin hood,"
8079,47,sleeping in the underwood!
8080,47,"honour to maid marian,"
8081,47,and to all the sherwood clan!
8082,47,though their days have hurried by
8083,47,"let us two a burden try,"
8084,48,as i lay in my bed slepe full unmete
8085,48,"          was unto me, but why that i ne might"
8086,48,"          rest i ne wist, for there n'as erthly wight"
8087,48,          [as i suppose] had more of hertis ese
8088,48,"          than i, for i n'ad sicknesse nor disese,"
8089,48,                                                    chaucer
8090,48,
8091,48,       what is more gentle than a wind in summer?
8092,48,       what is more soothing than the pretty hummer
8093,48,"       that stays one moment in an open flower,"
8094,48,       and buzzes cheerily from bower to bower?
8095,48,       what is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing
8096,48,"       in a green island, far from all men's knowing?"
8097,48,       more healthful than the leafiness of dales?
8098,48,       more secret than a nest of nightingales?
8099,48,       more serene than cordelia's countenance?
8100,48,       more full of visions than a high romance?
8101,48,"       what, but thee sleep? soft closer of our eyes!"
8102,48,       low murmurer of tender lullabies!
8103,48,       light hoverer around our happy pillows!
8104,48,"       wreather of poppy buds, and weeping willows!"
8105,48,       silent entangler of a beauty's tresses!
8106,48,       most happy listener! when the morning blesses
8107,48,       thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes
8108,48,"       that glance so brightly at the new sun-rise,"
8109,48,
8110,48,       but what is higher beyond thought than thee?
8111,48,       fresher than berries of a mountain tree?
8112,48,"       more strange, more beautiful, more smooth, more regal,"
8113,48,"       than wings of swans, than doves, than dim-seen eagle?"
8114,48,       what is it? and to what shall i compare it?
8115,48,"       it has a glory, and naught else can share it,"
8116,48,"       the thought thereof is awful, sweet, and holy,"
8117,48,       chasing away all worldliness and folly;
8118,48,"       coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder,"
8119,48,       or the low rumblings earth's regions under;
8120,48,       and sometimes like a gentle whispering
8121,48,       of all the secrets of some wond'rous thing
8122,48,       that breathes about us in the vacant air;
8123,48,"       so that we look around with prying stare,"
8124,48,"       perhaps to see shapes of light, aerial limning,"
8125,48,       and catch soft floatings from a faint-heard hymning;
8126,48,"       to see the laurel wreath, on high suspended,"
8127,48,"       that is to crown our name when life is ended,"
8128,48,"       sometimes it gives a glory to the voice,"
8129,48,"       and from the heart up-springs, rejoice! rejoice!"
8130,48,"       sounds which will reach the framer of all things,"
8131,48,"       and die away in ardent mutterings,"
8132,48,
8133,48,"       no one who once the glorious sun has seen,"
8134,48,"       and all the clouds, and felt his bosom clean"
8135,48,"       for his great maker's presence, but must know"
8136,48,"       what 'tis i mean, and feel his being glow,"
8137,48,"       therefore no insult will i give his spirit,"
8138,48,"       by telling what he sees from native merit,"
8139,48,
8140,48,       o poesy! for thee i hold my pen
8141,48,       that am not yet a glorious denizen
8142,48,       of thy wide heaven- should i rather kneel
8143,48,       upon some mountain-top until i feel
8144,48,"       a glowing splendour round about me hung,"
8145,48,       and echo back the voice of thine own tongue?
8146,48,       o poesy! for thee i grasp my pen
8147,48,       that am not yet a glorious denizen
8148,48,"       of thy wide heaven; yet, to my ardent prayer,"
8149,48,"       yield from thy sanctuary some clear air,"
8150,48,       smooth'd for intoxication by the breath
8151,48,"       of flowering bays, that i may die a death"
8152,48,"       of luxury, and my young spirit follow"
8153,48,       the morning sun-beams to the great apollo
8154,48,"       like a fresh sacrifice; or, if i can bear"
8155,48,"       the o'erwhelming sweets, 'twill bring to me the fair"
8156,48,"       visions of all places, a bowery nook"
8157,48,       will be elysium- an eternal book
8158,48,       whence i may copy many a lovely saying
8159,48,"       about the leaves, and flowers- about the playing"
8160,48,"       of nymphs in woods, and fountains; and the shade"
8161,48,       keeping a silence round a sleeping maid;
8162,48,       and many a verse from so strange influence
8163,48,"       that we must ever wonder how, and whence"
8164,48,"       it came, also imaginings will hover"
8165,48,"       round my fire-side, and haply there discover"
8166,48,"       vistas of solemn beauty, where i'd wander"
8167,48,"       in happy silence, like the clear meander"
8168,48,       through its lone vales; and where i found a spot
8169,48,"       of awfuller shade, or an enchanted grot,"
8170,48,       or a green hill o'erspread with chequer'd dress
8171,48,"       of flowers, and fearful from its loveliness,"
8172,48,"       write on my tablets all that was permitted,"
8173,48,"       all that was for our human senses fitted,"
8174,48,       then the events of this wide world i'd seize
8175,48,"       like a strong giant, and my spirit teaze"
8176,48,       till at its shoulders it should proudly see
8177,48,"       wings to find out an immortality,"
8178,48,
8179,48,       stop and consider! life is but a day;
8180,48,       a fragile dew-drop on its perilous way
8181,48,       from a tree's summit; a poor indian's sleep
8182,48,       while his boat hastens to the monstrous steep
8183,48,"       of montmorenci, why so sad a moan?"
8184,48,       life is the rose's hope while yet unblown;
8185,48,       the reading of an ever-changing tale;
8186,48,       the light uplifting of a maiden's veil;
8187,48,       a pigeon tumbling in clear summer air;
8188,48,"       a laughing school-boy, without grief or care,"
8189,48,"       riding the springy branches of an elm,"
8190,48,
8191,48,"       o for ten years, that i may overwhelm"
8192,48,       myself in poesy; so i may do the deed
8193,48,"       that my own soul has to itself decreed,"
8194,48,       then will i pass the countries that i see
8195,48,"       in long perspective, and continually"
8196,48,"       taste their pure fountains, first the realm i'll pass"
8197,48,"       of flora, and old pan, sleep in the grass,"
8198,48,"       feed upon apples red, and strawberries,"
8199,48,       and choose each pleasure that my fancy sees;
8200,48,"       catch the white-handed nymphs in shady places,"
8201,48,"       to woo sweet kisses from averted faces,-"
8202,48,"       play with their fingers, touch their shoulders white"
8203,48,       into a pretty shrinking with a bite
8204,48,"       as hard as lips can make it, till agreed,"
8205,48,"       a lovely tale of human life we'll read,"
8206,48,       and one will teach a tame dove how it best
8207,48,       may fan the cool air gently o'er my rest;
8208,48,"       another, bending o'er her nimble tread,"
8209,48,"       will set a green robe floating round her head,"
8210,48,"       and still will dance with ever varied ease,"
8211,48,"       smiling upon the flowers and the trees,"
8212,48,"       another will entice me on, and on"
8213,48,       through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon;
8214,48,       till in the bosom of a leafy world
8215,48,"       we rest in silence, like two gems upcurl'd"
8216,48,"       in the recesses of a pearly shell,"
8217,48,
8218,48,       and can i ever bid these joys farewell?
8219,48,"       yes, i must pass them for a nobler life,"
8220,48,"       where i may find the agonies, the strife"
8221,48,"       of human hearts, for lo! i see afar,"
8222,48,"       o'ersailing the blue cragginess, a car"
8223,48,       and steeds with streamy manes- the charioteer
8224,48,"       looks out upon the winds with glorious fear,"
8225,48,       and now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly
8226,48,       along a huge cloud's ridge; and now with sprightly
8227,48,"       wheel downward come they into fresher skies,"
8228,48,"       tipt round with silver from the sun's bright eyes,"
8229,48,       still downward with capacious whirl they glide;
8230,48,       and now i see them on the green-hill's side
8231,48,"       in breezy rest among the nodding stalks,"
8232,48,       the charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks
8233,48,       to the trees and mountains; and there soon appear
8234,48,"       shapes of delight, of mystery, and fear,"
8235,48,       passing along before a dusky space
8236,48,"       made by some mighty oaks, as they would chase"
8237,48,"       some ever- fleeting music on they sweep,"
8238,48,"       lo! how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep,"
8239,48,       some with upholden hand and mouth severe;
8240,48,       some with their faces muffled to the ear
8241,48,"       between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,"
8242,48,       go glad and smilingly athwart the gloom;
8243,48,"       some looking back, and some with upward gaze;"
8244,48,"       yes, thousands in a thousand different ways"
8245,48,       flit onward- now a lovely wreath of girls
8246,48,       dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls;
8247,48,"       and now broad wings, most awfully intent"
8248,48,"       the driver of those steeds is forward bent,"
8249,48,"       and seems to listen, o that i might know"
8250,48,"       all that he writes with such a hurrying glow,"
8251,48,
8252,48,       the visions all are fled- the car is fled
8253,48,"       into the light of heaven, and in their stead"
8254,48,"       a sense of real things comes doubly strong,"
8255,48,"       and, like a muddy stream, would bear along"
8256,48,"       my soul to nothingness, but i will strive"
8257,48,"       against all doubtings, and will keep alive"
8258,48,"       the thought of that same chariot, and the strange"
8259,48,"       journey it went,"
8260,48,                             is there so small a range
8261,48,"       in the present strength of manhood, that the high"
8262,48,       imagination cannot freely fly
8263,48,"       as she was wont of old? prepare her steeds,"
8264,48,"       paw up against the light, and do strange deeds"
8265,48,       upon the clouds? has she not shown us all?
8266,48,"       from the clear space of ether, to the small"
8267,48,       breath of new buds unfolding? from the meaning
8268,48,"       of jove's large eye-brow, to the tender greening"
8269,48,"       of april meadows? here her altar shone,"
8270,48,       e'en in this isle; and who could paragon
8271,48,       the fervid choir that lifted up a noise
8272,48,"       of harmony, to where it aye will poise"
8273,48,"       its mighty self of convoluting sound,"
8274,48,"       huge as a planet, and like that roll round,"
8275,48,       eternally around a dizzy void?
8276,48,"       ay, in those days the muses were nigh cloy'd"
8277,48,       with honors; nor had any other care
8278,48,"       than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair,"
8279,48,
8280,48,"       could all this be forgotten? yes, a schism"
8281,48,"       nurtured by foppery and barbarism,"
8282,48,"       made great apollo blush for this his land,"
8283,48,       men were thought wise who could not understand
8284,48,"       his glories, with a puling infant's force"
8285,48,"       they sway'd about upon a rocking horse,"
8286,48,"       and thought it pegasus, ah dismal soul'd!"
8287,48,"       the winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll'd"
8288,48,"       its gathering waves- ye felt it not, the blue"
8289,48,"       bared its eternal bosom, and the dew"
8290,48,       of summer nights collected still to make
8291,48,"       the morning precious, beauty was awake!"
8292,48,       why were ye not awake? but ye were dead
8293,48,"       to things ye knew not of,- were closely wed"
8294,48,       to musty laws lined out with wretched rule
8295,48,"       and compass vile, so that ye taught a school"
8296,48,"       of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit,"
8297,48,"       till, like the certain wands of jacob's wit,"
8298,48,"       their verses tallied, easy was the task,"
8299,48,       a thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask
8300,48,"       of poesy, ill-fated, impious race!"
8301,48,"       that blasphemed the bright lyrist to his face,"
8302,48,"       and did not know it,- no, they went about,"
8303,48,"       holding a poor, decrepid standard out"
8304,48,"       mark'd with most flimsy mottos, and in large"
8305,48,       the name of one boileau!
8306,48,
8307,48,                                     o ye whose charge
8308,48,       it is to hover round our pleasant hills!
8309,48,       whose congregated majesty so fills
8310,48,"       my boundly reverence, that i cannot trace"
8311,48,"       your hallowed names, in this unholy place,"
8312,48,       so near those common folk; did not their shames
8313,48,       affright you? did our old lamenting thames
8314,48,       delight you? did ye never cluster round
8315,48,"       delicious avon, with a mournful sound,"
8316,48,       and weep? or did ye wholly bid adieu
8317,48,       to regions where no more the laurel grew?
8318,48,       or did ye stay to give a welcoming
8319,48,       to some lone spirits who could proudly sing
8320,48,"       their youth away, and die? 'twas even so,"
8321,48,"       but let me think away those times of woe,"
8322,48,       now 'tis a fairer season; ye have breathed
8323,48,       rich benedictions o'er us; ye have wreathed
8324,48,"       fresh garlands, for sweet music has been heard"
8325,48,       in many places;- some has been upstirr'd
8326,48,"       from out its crystal dwelling in a lake,"
8327,48,"       by a swan's ebon bill; from a thick brake,"
8328,48,"       nested and quiet in a valley mild,"
8329,48,       bubbles a pipe; fine sounds are floating wild
8330,48,"       about the earth, happy are ye and glad,"
8331,48,
8332,48,"       these things are doubtless, yet in truth we've had"
8333,48,       strange thunders from the potency of song;
8334,48,"       mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong,"
8335,48,"       from majesty, but in clear truth the themes"
8336,48,"       are ugly clubs, the poets' polyphemes"
8337,48,"       disturbing the grand sea, a drainless shower"
8338,48,       of light is poesy; 'tis the supreme of power;
8339,48,"       'tis might half slumb'ring on its own right arm,"
8340,48,       the very archings of her eye-lids charm
8341,48,"       a thousand willing agents to obey,"
8342,48,"       and still she governs with the mildest sway,"
8343,48,       but strength alone though of the muses born
8344,48,"       is like a fallen angel, trees uptorn,"
8345,48,"       darkness, and worms, and shrouds, and sepulchres"
8346,48,"       delight it; for it feeds upon the burrs,"
8347,48,       and thorns of life; forgetting the great end
8348,48,"       of poesy, that it should be a friend"
8349,48,"       to sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man,"
8350,48,
8351,48,"         yet i rejoice, a myrtle fairer than"
8352,48,"       e'er grew in paphos, from the bitter weeds"
8353,48,"       lifts its sweet head into the air, and feeds"
8354,48,"       a silent space with ever sprouting green,"
8355,48,"       all tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen,"
8356,48,"       creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering,"
8357,48,"       nibble the little cupped flowers and sing,"
8358,48,       then let us clear away the choking thorns
8359,48,"       from round its gentle stem; let the young fawns,"
8360,48,"       yeaned in after times, when we are flown,"
8361,48,"       find a fresh sward beneath it, overgrown"
8362,48,"       with simple flowers, let there nothing be"
8363,48,       more boisterous than a lover's bended knee;
8364,48,       nought more ungentle than the placid look
8365,48,       of one who leans upon a closed book;
8366,48,       nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes
8367,48,"       between two hills, all hail delightful hopes!"
8368,48,"       as she was wont, th' imagination"
8369,48,"       into most lovely labyrinths will be gone,"
8370,48,       and they shall be accounted poet kings
8371,48,"       who simply tell the most heart-easing things,"
8372,48,"       o may these joys be ripe before i die,"
8373,48,
8374,48,       will not some say that i presumptuously
8375,48,       have spoken? that from hastening disgrace
8376,48,       'twere better far to hide my foolish face?
8377,48,       that whining boyhood should with reverence bow
8378,48,       ere the dread thunderbolt could reach? how!
8379,48,"       if i do hide myself, it sure shall be"
8380,48,"       in the very fane, the light of poesy,"
8381,48,"       if i do fall, at least i will be laid"
8382,48,       beneath the silence of a poplar shade;
8383,48,       and over me the grass shall be smooth shaven;
8384,48,"       and there shall be a kind memorial graven,"
8385,48,       but off despondence! miserable bane!
8386,48,"       they should not know thee, who athirst to gain"
8387,48,"       a noble end, are thirsty every hour,"
8388,48,       what though i am not wealthy in the dower
8389,48,       of spanning wisdom; though i do not know
8390,48,       the shiftings of the mighty winds that blow
8391,48,       hither and thither all the changing thoughts
8392,48,"       of man, though no great minist'ring reason sorts"
8393,48,       out the dark mysteries of human souls
8394,48,"       to clear conceiving, yet there ever rolls"
8395,48,"       a vast idea before me, and i glean"
8396,48,       therefrom my liberty; thence too i've seen
8397,48,"       the end and aim of poesy, 'tis clear"
8398,48,       as anything most true; as that the year
8399,48,       is made of the four seasons- manifest
8400,48,"       as a large cross, some old cathedral's crest,"
8401,48,"       lifted to the white clouds, therefore should i"
8402,48,"       be but the essence of deformity,"
8403,48,"       a coward, did my very eye-lids wink"
8404,48,"       at speaking out what i have dared to think,"
8405,48,       ah! rather let me like a madman run
8406,48,       over some precipice; let the hot sun
8407,48,"       melt my dedalian wings, and drive me down"
8408,48,       convuls'd and headlong! stay! an inward frown
8409,48,"       of conscience bids me be more calm awhile,"
8410,48,"       an ocean dim, sprinkled with many an isle,"
8411,48,"       spreads awfully before me, how much toil!"
8412,48,       how many days! what desperate turmoil!
8413,48,"       ere i can have explored its widenesses,"
8414,48,"       ah, what a task! upon my bended knees,"
8415,48,"       i could unsay those- no, impossible!"
8416,48,       impossible!
8417,48,
8418,48,                     for sweet relief i'll dwell
8419,48,"       on humbler thoughts, and let this strange assay"
8420,48,"       begun in gentleness die so away,"
8421,48,"       e'en now all tumult from my bosom fades,"
8422,48,       i turn full hearted to the friendly aids
8423,48,"       that smooth the path of honour; brotherhood,"
8424,48,"       and friendliness the nurse of mutual good,"
8425,48,       the hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet
8426,48,       into the brain ere one can think upon it;
8427,48,       the silence when some rhymes are coming out;
8428,48,"       and when they're come, the very pleasant rout,"
8429,48,"       the message certain to be done to-morrow,"
8430,48,       'tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow
8431,48,"       some precious book from out its snug retreat,"
8432,48,"       to cluster round it when we next shall meet,"
8433,48,       scarce can i scribble on; for lovely airs
8434,48,       are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs;
8435,48,"       many delights of that glad day recalling,"
8436,48,"       when first my senses caught their tender falling,"
8437,48,       and with these airs come forms of elegance
8438,48,"       stooping their shoulders o'er a horse's prance,"
8439,48,"       careless, and grand-fingers soft and round"
8440,48,       parting luxuriant curls;- and the swift bound
8441,48,"       of bacchus from his chariot, when his eye"
8442,48,"       made ariadne's cheek look blushingly,"
8443,48,       thus i remember all the pleasant flow
8444,48,"       of words at opening a portfolio,"
8445,48,
8446,48,       things such as these are ever harbingers
8447,48,"       to trains of peaceful images, the stirs"
8448,48,"       of a swan's neck unseen among the rushes,"
8449,48,"       a linnet starting all about the bushes,"
8450,48,"       a butterfly, with golden wings broad parted,"
8451,48,"       nestling a rose, convuls'd as though it smarted"
8452,48,"       with over pleasure- many, many more,"
8453,48,       might i indulge at large in all my store
8454,48,"       of luxuries, yet i must not forget"
8455,48,"       sleep, quiet with his poppy coronet,"
8456,48,       for what there may be worthy in these rhymes
8457,48,"       i partly owe to him, and thus, the chimes"
8458,48,       of friendly voices had just given place
8459,48,"       to as sweet a silence, when i 'gan retrace"
8460,48,"       the pleasant day, upon a couch at ease,"
8461,48,       it was a poet's house who keeps the keys
8462,48,"       of pleasure's temple, round about were hung"
8463,48,       the glorious features of the bards who sung
8464,48,       in other ages- cold and sacred busts
8465,48,"       smiled at each other, happy he who trusts"
8466,48,       to clear futurity his darling fame!
8467,48,       then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim
8468,48,       at swelling apples with a frisky leap
8469,48,"       and reaching fingers, 'mid a luscious heap"
8470,48,"       of vine-leaves, then there rose to view a fane"
8471,48,"       of liny marble, and thereto a train"
8472,48,"       of nymphs approaching fairly o'er the sward,"
8473,48,"       one, loveliest, holding her white hand toward"
8474,48,"       the dazzling sun-rise, two sisters sweet"
8475,48,       bending their graceful figures till they meet
8476,48,"       over the trippings of a little child,"
8477,48,"       and some are hearing, eagerly, the wild"
8478,48,"       thrilling liquidity of dewy piping,"
8479,48,"       see, in another picture, nymphs are wiping"
8480,48,       cherishingly diana's timorous limbs;-
8481,48,       a fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims
8482,48,"       at the bath's edge, and keeps a gentle motion"
8483,48,"       with the subsiding crystal, as when ocean"
8484,48,       heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothness o'er
8485,48,"       its rocky marge, and balances once more"
8486,48,       the patient weeds; that now unshent by foam
8487,48,"       feel all about their undulating home,"
8488,48,
8489,48,       sappho's meek head was there half smiling down
8490,48,       at nothing; just as though the earnest frown
8491,48,       of over thinking had that moment gone
8492,48,"       from off her brow, and left her all alone,"
8493,48,
8494,48,"       great alfred's too, with anxious, pitying eyes,"
8495,48,       as if he always listened to the sighs
8496,48,       of the goaded world; and kosciusko's worn
8497,48,"       by horrid suffrance- mightily forlorn,"
8498,48,"       petrarch, outstepping from the shady green,"
8499,48,       starts at the sight of laura; nor can wean
8500,48,"       his eyes from her sweet face, most happy they!"
8501,48,       for over them was seen a free display
8502,48,"       of out-spread wings, and from between them shone"
8503,48,"       the face of poesy, from off her throne"
8504,48,"       she overlook'd things that i scarce could tell,"
8505,48,       the very sense of where i was might well
8506,48,"       keep sleep aloof, but more than that there came"
8507,48,       thought after thought to nourish up the flame
8508,48,       within my breast; so that the morning light
8509,48,       surprised me even from a sleepless night;
8510,48,"       and up i rose refresh'd, and glad, and gay,"
8511,48,       resolving to begin that very day
8512,48,"       these lines; and howsoever they be done,"
8513,48,"       i leave them as a father does his son,"
8514,48,
8515,48,                       the end
8516,49,"the day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!"
8517,49,"sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast,"
8518,49,"warm breath, light whisper, tender semitone,"
8519,49,"bright eyes, accomplished shape, and lang'rous waist!"
8520,49,"faded the flower and all its budded charms,"
8521,49,"faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,"
8522,49,"faded the shape of beauty from my arms,"
8523,49,"faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise—"
8524,49,"vanished unseasonably at shut of eve,"
8525,49,when the dusk holiday—or holinight
8526,49,of fragrant-curtained love begins to weave
8527,49,"the woof of darkness thick, for hid delight;"
8528,49,"but, as i've read love's missal through today,"
8529,49,"he'll let me sleep, seeing i fast and pray,"
8530,50,the eve of saint mark -
8531,50,
8532,50,upon a sabbath-day it fell;
8533,50,
8534,50,twice holy was the sabbath-bell
8535,50,
8536,50,that call'd the folk to evening prayer;
8537,50,
8538,50,the city streets were clean and fair
8539,50,
8540,50,from wholesome drench of april rains;
8541,50,
8542,50,"and, on the western window panes,"
8543,50,
8544,50,the chilly sunset faintly told
8545,50,
8546,50,"of unmatur'd green vallies cold,"
8547,50,
8548,50,"of the green thorny bloomless hedge,"
8549,50,
8550,50,"of rivers new with spring-tide sedge,"
8551,50,
8552,50,"of primroses by shelter'd rills,"
8553,50,
8554,50,"and daisies on the aguish hills,"
8555,50,
8556,50,"twice holy was the sabbath-bell,"
8557,50,
8558,50,the silent streets were crowded well
8559,50,
8560,50,"with staid and pious companies,"
8561,50,
8562,50,"warm from their fire-side orat'ries,"
8563,50,
8564,50,and moving with demurest air
8565,50,
8566,50,"to even-song and vesper prayer,"
8567,50,
8568,50,each arched porch and entry low
8569,50,
8570,50,"was fill'd with patient folk and slow,"
8571,50,
8572,50,"with whispers hush, and shuffling feet,"
8573,50,
8574,50,"while play'd the organ loud and sweet, -"
8575,50,

8579,50,
8580,50,"a curious volume, patch'd and torn,"
8581,50,
8582,50,"that all day long, from earliest morn,"
8583,50,
8584,50,had taken captive her two eyes
8585,50,
8586,50,among its golden broideries;
8587,50,
8588,50,"perplex'd her with a thousand things,-"
8589,50,
8590,50,"the stars of heaven, and angels' wings,"
8591,50,
8592,50,"martyrs in a fiery blaze,"
8593,50,
8594,50,"azure saints in silver rays,"
8595,50,

8606,50,"cherubim and golden mice, -"
8607,50,
8608,50,"bertha was a maiden fair,"
8609,50,
8610,50,dwelling in the old minster-square;
8611,50,
8612,50,from her fire-side she could see
8613,50,
8614,50,"sidelong its rich antiquity,"
8615,50,
8616,50,far as the bishop's garden-wall;
8617,50,
8618,50,"where sycamores and elm-trees tall,"
8619,50,
8620,50,"full-leav'd, the forest had outstript,"

8651,50,
8652,50,"the clamorous daws, that all the day"
8653,50,
8654,50,"above tree-tops and towers play,"
8655,50,
8656,50,"pair by pair had gone to rest,"
8657,50,
8658,50,"each in its ancient belfry-nest,"
8659,50,
8660,50,where asleep they fall betimes
8661,50,
8662,50,"to music of the drowsy chimes, -"
8663,50,
8664,50,"all was silent, all was gloom"
8665,50,
8666,50,"abroad and in the homely room,"
8667,50,
8668,50,"down she sat, poor cheated soul!"
8669,50,
8670,50,and struck a lamp from the dismal coal;
8671,50,
8672,50,lean'd forward with bright drooping hair
8673,50,
8674,50,"and slant book full against the glare,"
8675,50,
8676,50,"her shadow, in uneasy guise,"
8677,50,
8678,50,"hover'd about, a giant size,"
8679,50,
8680,50,"on ceiling-beam and old oak chair,"
8681,50,
8682,50,"the parrot's cage, and panel square;"
8683,50,
8684,50,"and the warm angled winter screen,"
8685,50,
8686,50,"on which were many monsters seen,"
8687,50,
8688,50,"call'd doves of siam, lima mice,"
8689,50,
8690,50,"and legless birds of paradise,"
8691,50,
8692,50,"macaw, and tender avadavat,"
8693,50,
8694,50,"and silken-furr'd angora cat,"
8695,50,
8696,50,"untir'd she read, her shadow still"
8697,50,
8698,50,glower'd about as it would fill
8699,50,
8700,50,"the room with wildest forms and shades,"
8701,50,
8702,50,as though some ghostly queen of spades
8703,50,
8704,50,"had come to mock behind her back,"
8705,50,
8706,50,"and dance, and ruffle her garments black,"
8707,50,
8708,50,untir'd she read the legend page
8709,50,
8710,50,"of holy mark, from youth to age,"
8711,50,
8712,50,"on land, on sea, in pagan chains,"
8713,50,
8714,50,"rejoicing for his many pains,"
8715,50,
8716,50,sometimes the learned eremite
8717,50,
8718,50,"with golden star, or dagger bright,"
8719,50,
8720,50,referr'd to pious poesies
8721,51,"st agnes' eve---ah, bitter chill it was!"
8722,51,"   the owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;"
8723,51,"   the hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass,"
8724,51,"   and silent was the flock in woolly fold,"
8725,51,"   numb were the beadsman's fingers, while he told"
8726,51,"   his rosary, and while his frosted breath,"
8727,51,"   like pious incense from a censer old,"
8728,51,"   seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death,"
8729,51,"past the sweet virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith,"
8730,51,
8731,51,"   his prayer he saith, this patient, holy man;"
8732,51,"   then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees,"
8733,51,"   and back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan,"
8734,51,"   along the chapel aisle by slow degrees,"
8735,51,"   the sculptur'd dead, on each side, seem to freeze,"
8736,51,"   emprison'd in black, purgatorial rails,"
8737,51,"   knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat'ries,"
8738,51,   he passeth by; and his weak spirit fails
8739,51,"to think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails,"
8740,51,
8741,51,"   northward he turneth through a little door,"
8742,51,"   and scarce three steps, ere music's golden tongue"
8743,51,   flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor;
8744,51,   but no---already had his deathbell rung
8745,51,"   the joys of all his life were said and sung,"
8746,51,"   his was harsh penance on st, agnes' eve,"
8747,51,"   another way he went, and soon among"
8748,51,"   rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve,"
8749,51,"and all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve,"
8750,51,
8751,51,   that ancient beadsman heard the prelude soft;
8752,51,"   and so it chanc'd, for many a door was wide,"
8753,51,"   from hurry to and fro, soon, up aloft,"
8754,51,"   the silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide,"
8755,51,"   the level chambers, ready with their pride,"
8756,51,"   were glowing to receive a thousand guests,"
8757,51,"   the carved angels, ever eager-eyed,"
8758,51,"   star'd, where upon their heads the cornice rests,"
8759,51,"with hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts,"
8760,51,
8761,51,"   at length burst in the argent revelry,"
8762,51,"   with plume, tiara, and all rich array,"
8763,51,   numerous as shadows haunting fairily
8764,51,"   the brain, new-stuff'd, in youth, with triumphs gay"
8765,51,"   of old romance, these let us wish away,"
8766,51,"   and turn, sole-thoughted, to one lady there,"
8767,51,"   whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day,"
8768,51,"   on love, and wing'd st agnes' saintly care,"
8769,51,"as she had heard old dames full rnany times declare,"
8770,51,
8771,51,"   they told her how, upon st agnes' eve,"
8772,51,"   young virgins might have visions of delight,"
8773,51,   and soft adorings from their loves receive
8774,51,"   upon the honey'd middle of the night,"
8775,51,   if ceremonies due they did aright;
8776,51,"   as, supperless to bed they must retire,"
8777,51,"   and couch supine their beauties, lily white;"
8778,51,"   nor look behind, nor sideways, but require"
8779,51,"of heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire,"
8780,51,
8781,51,"   full of this whim was thoughtful madeline,"
8782,51,"   the music, yearning like a god in pain,"
8783,51,"   she scarcely heard, her maiden eyes divine,"
8784,51,"   fix'd on the floor, saw many a sweeping train"
8785,51,"   pass by---she heeded not at all, in vain"
8786,51,"   came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier,"
8787,51,"   and back retir'd; not cool'd by high disdain,"
8788,51,"   but she saw not, her heart was otherwhere;"
8789,51,"she sigh'd for agnes' dreams, the sweetest of the year,"
8790,51,
8791,51,"   she danc'd along with vague, regardless eyes,"
8792,51,"   anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short,"
8793,51,"   the hallow'd hour was near at hand, she sighs"
8794,51,"   amid the timbrels, and the throng'd resort"
8795,51,"   of whisperers in anger, or in sport;"
8796,51,"   'mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn,"
8797,51,"   hoodwink'd with faery fancy; all amort,"
8798,51,"   save to st agnes and her lambs unshorn,"
8799,51,"and all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn,"
8800,51,
8801,51,"   so, purposing each moment to retire,"
8802,51,"   she linger'd still, meantime, across the moors,"
8803,51,"   had come young porphyro, with heart on fire"
8804,51,"   for madeline, beside the portal doors,"
8805,51,"   buttress'd from moonlight, stands he, and implores"
8806,51,"   all saints to give him sight of madeline,"
8807,51,"   but for one moment in the tedious hours,"
8808,51,   that he might gaze and worship all unseen;
8809,51,"perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss---in sooth such things have been,"
8810,51,
8811,51,"   he ventures in, let no buzz'd whisper tell,"
8812,51,"   all eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords"
8813,51,"   will storm his heart, love's fev'rous citadel,"
8814,51,"   for him, those chambers held barbarian hordes,"
8815,51,"   hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords,"
8816,51,   whose very dogs would execrations howl
8817,51,"   against his lineage, not one breast affords"
8818,51,"   him any mercy, in that mansion foul,"
8819,51,"save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul,"
8820,51,
8821,51,"   ah, happy chance! the aged creature came,"
8822,51,"   shuffling along with ivory-headed wand,"
8823,51,"   to where he stood, hid from the torch's flame,"
8824,51,"   behind a broad hall-pillar, far beyond"
8825,51,"   the sound of merriment and chorus bland,"
8826,51,"   he startled her; but soon she knew his face,"
8827,51,"   and grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand,"
8828,51,"   saying, mercy, porphyro! hie thee from this place;"
8829,51,"they are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race!"
8830,51,
8831,51,   get hence! get hence! there's dwarfish hildebrand;
8832,51,"   he had a fever late, and in the fit"
8833,51,"   he cursed thee and thine, both house and land,"
8834,51,"   then there's that old lord maurice, not a whit"
8835,51,   more tame for his gray hairs---alas me! flit!
8836,51,"   flit like a ghost away,---ah, gossip dear,"
8837,51,"   we're safe enough; here in this arm-chair sit,"
8838,51,"   and tell me how---good saints! not here, not here;"
8839,51,"follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier,"
8840,51,
8841,51,"   he follow'd through a lowly arched way,"
8842,51,"   brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume,"
8843,51,   and as she mutter'd well-a---well-a-day!
8844,51,"   he found him in a little moonlight room,"
8845,51,"   pale, lattic'd, chill, and silent as a tomb,"
8846,51,"   now tell me where is madeline, said he,"
8847,51,"   o tell me, angela, by the holy loom"
8848,51,"   which none but secret sisterhood may see,"
8849,51,"when they st agnes' wool are weaving piously,"
8850,51,
8851,51,   st agnes! ah! it is st agnes' eve---
8852,51,"   yet men will murder upon holy days,"
8853,51,"   thou must hold water in a witch's sieve,"
8854,51,   and be liege-lord of all the elves and fays
8855,51,"   to venture so, it fills me with amaze"
8856,51,"   to see thee, porphyro!---st agnes' eve!"
8857,51,   god's help! my lady fair the conjuror plays
8858,51,"   this very night, good angels her deceive!"
8859,51,"but let me laugh awhile, i've mickle time to grieve,"
8860,51,
8861,51,"   feebly she laugheth in the languid moon,"
8862,51,"   while porphyro upon her face doth look,"
8863,51,   like puzzled urchin on an aged crone
8864,51,"   who keepeth clos'd a wondrous riddle-book,"
8865,51,"   as spectacled she sits in chimney nook,"
8866,51,"   but soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told"
8867,51,   his lady's purpose; and he scarce could brook
8868,51,"   tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold"
8869,51,"and madeline asleep in lap of legends old,"
8870,51,
8871,51,"   sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,"
8872,51,"   flushing his brow, and in his pained heart"
8873,51,"   made purple riot, then doth he propose"
8874,51,"   a stratagem, that makes the beldame start,"
8875,51,"   a cruel man and impious thou art,"
8876,51,"   sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream"
8877,51,"   alone with her good angels, far apart"
8878,51,"   from wicked men like thee, go, go!---i deem"
8879,51,"thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem,"
8880,51,
8881,51,"   i will not harm her, by all saints i swear,"
8882,51,"   quoth porphyro, o may i ne'er find grace"
8883,51,"   when my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer,"
8884,51,"   if one of her soft ringlets i displace,"
8885,51,"   or look with ruffian passion in her face,"
8886,51,"   good angela, believe me by these tears;"
8887,51,"   or i will, even in a moment's space,"
8888,51,"   awake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears,"
8889,51,"and beard them, though they be more fang'd than wolves and bears,"
8890,51,
8891,51,   ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul?
8892,51,"   a poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,"
8893,51,   whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll;
8894,51,"   whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening,"
8895,51,"   were never miss'd, thus plaining, doth she bring"
8896,51,   a gentler speech from burning porphyro;
8897,51,"   so woeful, and of such deep sorrowing,"
8898,51,   that angela gives promise she will do
8899,51,"whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe,"
8900,51,
8901,51,"   which was, to lead him, in close secrecy,"
8902,51,"   even to madeline's chamber, and there hide"
8903,51,"   him in a closet, of such privacy"
8904,51,"   that he might see her beauty unespied,"
8905,51,"   and win perhaps that night a peerless bride,"
8906,51,"   while legion'd fairies pac'd the coverlet,"
8907,51,"   and pale enchantment held her sleepy-eyed,"
8908,51,"   never on such a night have lovers met,"
8909,51,"since merlin paid his demon all the monstrous debt,"
8910,51,
8911,51,"   it shall be as thou wishest, said the dame,"
8912,51,   all cates and dainties shall be stored there
8913,51,"   quickly on this feast-night, by the tambour frame"
8914,51,"   her own lute thou wilt see, no time to spare,"
8915,51,"   for i am slow and feeble, and scarce dare"
8916,51,"   on such a catering trust my dizzy head,"
8917,51,"   wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer"
8918,51,"   the while, ah! thou must needs the lady wed,"
8919,51,"or may i never leave my grave among the dead,"
8920,51,
8921,51,"   so saying, she hobbled off with busy fear,"
8922,51,   the lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd;
8923,51,"   the dame return'd, and whisper'd in his ear"
8924,51,   to follow her; with aged eyes aghast
8925,51,"   from fright of dim espial, safe at last"
8926,51,"   through many a dusky gallery, they gain"
8927,51,"   the maiden's chamber, silken, hush'd and chaste;"
8928,51,"   where porphyro took covert, pleas'd amain,"
8929,51,"his poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain,"
8930,51,
8931,51,"   her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade,"
8932,51,"   old angela was feeling for the stair,"
8933,51,"   when madeline, st agnes' charmed maid,"
8934,51,"   rose, like a mission'd spirit, unaware,"
8935,51,"   with silver taper's light, and pious care,"
8936,51,"   she turn'd, and down the aged gossip led"
8937,51,"   to a safe level matting,  now prepare,"
8938,51,"   young porphyro, for gazing on that bed;"
8939,51,"she comes, she comes again, like dove fray'd and fled,"
8940,51,
8941,51,   out went the taper as she hurried in;
8942,51,"   its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died,"
8943,51,"   she closed the door, she panted, all akin"
8944,51,"   to spirits of the air, and visions wide,"
8945,51,"   no utter'd syllable, or, woe betide!"
8946,51,"   but to her heart, her heart was voluble,"
8947,51,   paining with eloquence her balmy side;
8948,51,   as though a tongueless nightingale should swell
8949,51,"her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell,"
8950,51,
8951,51,"   a casement high and triple-arch'd there was,"
8952,51,   all garlanded with carven imag'ries
8953,51,"   of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass,"
8954,51,"   and diamonded with panes of quaint device,"
8955,51,"   innumerable of stains and splendid dyes,"
8956,51,   as are the tiger-moth's deep-damask'd wings;
8957,51,"   and in the midst, 'mong thousand heraldries,"
8958,51,"   and twilight saints, and dim emblazonings,"
8959,51,"a shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings,"
8960,51,
8961,51,"   full on this casement shone the wintry moon,"
8962,51,"   and threw warm gules on madeline's fair breast,"
8963,51,   as down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon;
8964,51,"   rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,"
8965,51,"   and on her silver cross soft amethyst,"
8966,51,"   and on her hair a glory, like a saint,"
8967,51,"   she seem'd a splendid angel, newly drest,"
8968,51,"   save wings, for heaven,---porphyro grew faint,"
8969,51,"she knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint,"
8970,51,
8971,51,"   anon his heart revives, her vespers done,"
8972,51,   of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees;
8973,51,   unclasps her warmed jewels one by one;
8974,51,   loosens her fragrant bodice; by degrees
8975,51,"   her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees,"
8976,51,"   half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed,"
8977,51,"   pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,"
8978,51,"   in fancy, fair st agnes in her bed,"
8979,51,"but dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled,"
8980,51,
8981,51,"   soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest,"
8982,51,"   in sort of wakeful swoon, perplex'd she lay,"
8983,51,   until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd
8984,51,"   her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away;"
8985,51,"   flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;"
8986,51,    blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain;
8987,51,   clasp'd like a missal where swart paynims pray;
8988,51,"   blinded alike from sunshine and from rain,"
8989,51,"as though a rose should shut, and be a bud again,"
8990,51,
8991,51,"   stol'n to this paradise, and so entranced,"
8992,51,"   porphyro gazed upon her empty dress,"
8993,51,"   and listen'd to her breathing, if it chanced"
8994,51,   to wake into a slumbrous tenderness;
8995,51,"   which when he heard, that minute did he bless,"
8996,51,"   and breath'd himself, then from the closet crept,"
8997,51,"   noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness,"
8998,51,"   and over the hush'd carpet, silent, stept,"
8999,51,"and 'tween the curtains peep'd, where, lo!---how fast she slept!"
9000,51,
9001,51,"   then by the bed-side, where the faded moon"
9002,51,"   made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set"
9003,51,"   a table, and, half anguish'd, threw thereon"
9004,51,"   a doth of woven crimson, gold, and jet,---"
9005,51,   o for some drowsy morphean amulet!
9006,51,"   the boisterous, midnight, festive clarion,"
9007,51,"   the kettle-drum, and far-heard clarinet,"
9008,51,"   affray his ears, though but in dying tone,---"
9009,51,"the hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone,"
9010,51,
9011,51,"   and still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,"
9012,51,"   in blanched linen, smooth, and lavender'd,"
9013,51,   while he from forth the closet brought a heap
9014,51,"   of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd"
9015,51,"   with jellies soother than the creamy curd,"
9016,51,"   and lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon;"
9017,51,"   manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd"
9018,51,"   from fez; and spiced dainties, every one,"
9019,51,"from silken samarcand to cedar'd lebanon,"
9020,51,
9021,51,   these delicates he heap'd with glowing hand
9022,51,   on golden dishes and in baskets bright
9023,51,"   of wreathed silver, sumptuous they stand"
9024,51,"   in the retired quiet of the night,"
9025,51,"   filling the chilly room with perfume light,---"
9026,51,"   and now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!"
9027,51,"   thou art my heaven, and i thine eremite,"
9028,51,"   open thine eyes, for meek st agnes' sake,"
9029,51,"or i shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache,"
9030,51,
9031,51,"   thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm"
9032,51,"   sank in her pillow, shaded was her dream"
9033,51,"   by the dusk curtains,---'twas a midnight charm"
9034,51,"   impossible to melt as iced stream,"
9035,51,   the lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam;
9036,51,"   broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies,"
9037,51,"   it seem'd he never, never could redeem"
9038,51,   from such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes;
9039,51,"so mus'd awhile, entoil'd in woofed phantasies,"
9040,51,
9041,51,"   awakening up, he took her hollow lute,---"
9042,51,"   tumultuous,---and, in chords that tenderest be,"
9043,51,"   he play'd an ancient ditty, long since mute,"
9044,51,"   in provence call'd, la belle dame sans mercy,"
9045,51,"   close to her ear touching the melody,---"
9046,51,"   wherewith disturb'd, she utter'd a soft moan,"
9047,51,   he ceased---she panted quick---and suddenly
9048,51,"   her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone,"
9049,51,"upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone,"
9050,51,
9051,51,"   her eyes were open, but she still beheld,"
9052,51,"   now wide awake, the vision of her sleep,"
9053,51,"   there was a painful change, that nigh expell'd"
9054,51,"   the blisses of her dream so pure and deep,"
9055,51,"   at which fair madeline began to weep,"
9056,51,   and moan forth witless words with many a sigh;
9057,51,   while still her gaze on porphyro would keep;
9058,51,"   who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye,"
9059,51,"fearing to move or speak, she look'd so dreamingly,"
9060,51,
9061,51,"   ah, porphyro! said she, but even now"
9062,51,"   thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear,"
9063,51,   made tuneable with every sweetest vow;
9064,51,"   and those sad eyes were spiritual and clear,"
9065,51,"   how chang'd thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear!"
9066,51,"   give me that voice again, my porphyro,"
9067,51,"   those looks immortal, those complainings dear!"
9068,51,"   oh leave me not in this eternal woe,"
9069,51,"for if thou diest, my love, i know not where to go,"
9070,51,
9071,51,   beyond a mortal man impassion'd far
9072,51,"   at these voluptuous accents, he arose,"
9073,51,"   ethereal, flush'd, and like a throbbing star"
9074,51,   seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose
9075,51,"   into her dream he melted, as the rose"
9076,51,"   blendeth its odour with the violet,---"
9077,51,"   solution sweet, meantime the frost-wind blows"
9078,51,   like love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet
9079,51,"against the window-panes; st agnes' moon hath set,"
9080,51,
9081,51,"   tis dark, quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet,"
9082,51,"   this is no dream, my bride, my madeline!"
9083,51,"   'tis dark, the iced gusts still rave and beat,"
9084,51,"   no dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine!"
9085,51,"   porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine,---"
9086,51,   cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring?
9087,51,"   i curse not, for my heart is lost in thine"
9088,51,   though thou forsakest a deceived thing;---
9089,51,"a dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing,"
9090,51,
9091,51,   my madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!
9092,51,"   say, may i be for aye thy vassal blest?"
9093,51,"   thy beauty's shield, heart-shap'd and vermeil dyed?"
9094,51,"   ah, silver shrine, here will i take my rest"
9095,51,"   after so many hours of toil and quest,"
9096,51,"   a famish'd pilgrim,---saved by miracle,"
9097,51,"   though i have found, i will not rob thy nest"
9098,51,   saving of thy sweet self; if thou think'st well
9099,51,"   to trust, fair madeline, to no rude infidel,"
9100,51,
9101,51,"   hark! 'tis an elfin-storm from faery land,"
9102,51,"   of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed,"
9103,51,   arise---arise! the morning is at hand;---
9104,51,"   the bloated wassailers will never heed,---"
9105,51,"   let us away, my love, with happy speed;"
9106,51,"   there are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,---"
9107,51,"   drown'd all in rhenish and the sleepy mead,"
9108,51,"   awake! arise! my love, and fearless be,"
9109,51,"for o'er the southern moors i have a home for thee,"
9110,51,
9111,51,"   she hurried at his words, beset with fears,"
9112,51,"   for there were sleeping dragons all around,"
9113,51,"   at glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears---"
9114,51,"   down the wide stairs a darkling way they found,---"
9115,51,"   in all the house was heard no human sound,"
9116,51,   a chain-droop'd lamp was flickering by each door;
9117,51,"   the arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound,"
9118,51,   flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar;
9119,51,"and the long carpets rose along the gusty floor,"
9120,51,
9121,51,"   they glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall;"
9122,51,"   like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide;"
9123,51,"   where lay the porter, in uneasy sprawl,"
9124,51,"   with a huge empty flagon by his side,"
9125,51,"   the wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,"
9126,51,"   but his sagacious eye an inmate owns,"
9127,51,"   by one, and one, the bolts fill easy slide,---"
9128,51,"   the chains lie silent on the footworn stones,---"
9129,51,"the key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans,"
9130,51,
9131,51,"   and they are gone, ay, ages long ago"
9132,51,"   these lovers fled away into the storm,"
9133,51,"   that night the baron dreamt of many a woe,"
9134,51,"   and all his warrior-guests, with shade and form"
9135,51,"   of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm,"
9136,51,"   were long be-nightmar'd, angela the old"
9137,51,"   died palsy-twitch'd, with meagre face deform;"
9138,51,"   the beadsman, after thousand aves told,"
9139,51,"for aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold,"
9140,52,four seasons fill the measure of the year;
9141,52,"      there are four seasons in the mind of man,"
9142,52,"  he has his lusty spring, when fancy clear"
9143,52,"      takes in all beauty with an easy span,"
9144,52,"  he has his summer, when luxuriously"
9145,52,      spring's honied cud of youthful thought he loves
9146,52,"  to ruminate, and by such dreaming high"
9147,52,"      is nearest unto heaven, quiet coves"
9148,52,"  his soul has in its autumn, when his wings"
9149,52,      he furleth close; contented so to look
9150,52,  on mists in idleness--to let fair things
9151,52,"      pass by unheeded as a threshold brook,"
9152,52,"  he has his winter too of pale misfeature,"
9153,52,"  or else he would forego his mortal nature,"
9154,53,"think not of it, sweet one, so;---"
9155,53,     give it not a tear;
9156,53,"sigh thou mayst, and bid it go"
9157,53,"     any---anywhere,"
9158,53,
9159,53,"do not look so sad, sweet one,---"
9160,53,     sad and fadingly;
9161,53,"shed one drop then,---it is gone---"
9162,53,     o 'twas born to die!
9163,53,
9164,53,"still so pale? then, dearest, weep;"
9165,53,"     weep, i'll count the tears,"
9166,53,and each one shall be a bliss
9167,53,"     for thee in after years,"
9168,53,
9169,53,brighter has it left thine eyes
9170,53,     than a sunny rill;
9171,53,and thy whispering melodies
9172,53,"     are tenderer still,"
9173,53,
9174,53,yet---as all things mourn awhile
9175,53,"     at fleeting blisses,"
9176,53,e'en let us too! but be our dirge
9177,53,"     a dirge of kisses,"
9178,54,"this living hand, now warm and capable"
9179,54,"of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold"
9180,54,"and in the icy silence of the tomb,"
9181,54,so haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights
9182,54,that thou wouldst wish thine own heart dry of blood
9183,54,"so in my veins red life might stream again,"
9184,54,and thou be conscience-calmed - see here it is -
9185,54,"i hold it towards you,"
9186,55,"had i a man's fair form, then might my sighs"
9187,55,"be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell,"
9188,55,"thine ear, and find thy gentle heart; so well"
9189,55,"would passion arm me for the enterprise,"
9190,55,but ah! i am no knight whose foeman dies;
9191,55,no cuirass glistens on my bosom's swell;
9192,55,i am no happy shepherd of the dell
9193,55,"whose lips have trembled with a maiden's eyes,"
9194,55,"yet must i dote upon thee, -call thee sweet,"
9195,55,sweeter by far than hybla's honied roses
9196,55,"when steeped in dew rich to intoxication,"
9197,55,"ah! i will taste that dew, for me 'tis meet,"
9198,55,"and when the moon her pallid face discloses,"
9199,55,"i'll gather some by spells, and incantation,"
9200,56,"as late i rambled in the happy fields,"
9201,56,what time the skylark shakes the tremulous dew
9202,56,from his lush clover covert;—when anew
9203,56,adventurous knights take up their dinted shields;
9204,56,"i saw the sweetest flower wild nature yields,"
9205,56,a fresh-blown musk-rose; 'twas the first that threw
9206,56,"its sweets upon the summer, graceful it grew"
9207,56,"as is the wand that queen titania wields,"
9208,56,"and, as i feasted on its fragrancy,"
9209,56,i thought the garden-rose it far excelled;
9210,56,"but when, o wells! thy roses came to me,"
9211,56,"my sense with their deliciousness was spelled,"
9212,56,"soft voices had they, that with tender plea"
9213,56,"whispered of peace, and truth, and friendliness unquelled,"
9214,57,fresh morning gusts have blown away all fear
9215,57,"from my glad bosom,—now from gloominess"
9216,57,i mount for ever—not an atom less
9217,57,"than the proud laurel shall content my bier,"
9218,57,no! by the eternal stars! or why sit here
9219,57,"in the sun's eye, and 'gainst my temples press"
9220,57,"apollo's very leaves, woven to bless"
9221,57,"by thy white fingers and thy spirit clear,"
9222,57,"lo! who dares say, do this? who dares call down"
9223,57,"my will from its high purpose? who say,stand,"
9224,57,"or, go? this mighty moment i would frown"
9225,57,on abject caesars—not the stoutest band
9226,57,"of mailed heroes should tear off my crown,"
9227,57,"yet would i kneel and kiss thy gentle hand,"
9228,58,"hearken, thou craggy ocean-pyramid,"
9229,58,give answer by thy voice—the sea-fowls' screams!
9230,58,when were thy shoulders mantled in huge streams?
9231,58,when from the sun was thy broad forehead hid?
9232,58,how long is't since the mighty power bid
9233,58,thee heave to airy sleep from fathom dreams—
9234,58,sleep in the lap of thunder or sunbeams—
9235,58,or when grey clouds are thy cold coverlid!
9236,58,"thou answer'st not; for thou art dead asleep,"
9237,58,"thy life is but two dead eternities,"
9238,58,"the last in air, the former in the deep!"
9239,58,"first with the whales, last with the eagle-skies!"
9240,58,"drowned wast thou till an earthquake made thee steep,"
9241,58,another cannot wake thy giant-size!
9242,59,"season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,"
9243,59,close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
9244,59,conspiring with him how to load and bless
9245,59,with fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
9246,59,"to bend with apples the moss'd cottage trees,"
9247,59,and fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
9248,59,"to swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells"
9249,59,"with a sweet kernel; to set budding more,"
9250,59,"and still more, later flowers for the bees,"
9251,59,"until they think warm days will never cease,"
9252,59,"for summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells,"
9253,59,
9254,59,who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
9255,59,sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
9256,59,"thee sitting careless on a granary floor,"
9257,59,thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
9258,59,"or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,"
9259,59,"drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook"
9260,59,spares the next swath and all its twined flowers;
9261,59,and sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
9262,59,steady thy laden head across a brook;
9263,59,"or, by a cyder-press, with patient look,"
9264,59,"thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours,"
9265,59,
9266,59,"where are the songs of spring? ay, where are they?"
9267,59,"think not of them, thou hast thy music too,-"
9268,59,"while barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,"
9269,59,and touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
9270,59,then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
9271,59,"among the river sallows, borne aloft"
9272,59,or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
9273,59,and full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
9274,59,hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
9275,59,the red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
9276,59,"and gathering swallows twitter in the skies,"
9277,60,byron! how sweetly sad thy melody!
9278,60,"attuning still the soul to tenderness,"
9279,60,"as if soft pity, with unusual stress,"
9280,60,"had touch'd her plaintive lute, and thou, being by,"
9281,60,"hadst caught the tones, nor suffer'd them to die,"
9282,60,o'ershadowing sorrow doth not make thee less
9283,60,"delightful, thou thy griefs dost dress"
9284,60,"with a bright halo, shining beamily,"
9285,60,"as when a cloud the golden moon doth veil,"
9286,60,"its sides are ting'd with a resplendent glow,"
9287,60,"through the dark robe oft amber rays prevail,"
9288,60,and like fair veins in sable marble flow;
9289,60,"still warble, dying swan! still tell the tale,"
9290,60,"the enchanting tale, the tale of pleasing woe,"
9291,61,"i cry your mercy—pity—love!—aye, love!"
9292,61,"merciful love that tantalizes not,"
9293,61,"one-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,"
9294,61,"unmasked, and being seen—without a blot!"
9295,61,"o! let me have thee whole,—all—all—be mine!"
9296,61,"that shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest"
9297,61,"of love, your kiss,—those hands, those eyes divine,"
9298,61,"that warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,—"
9299,61,"yourself—your soul—in pity give me all,"
9300,61,"withhold no atom's atom or i die,"
9301,61,"or living on, perhaps, your wretched thrall,"
9302,61,"forget, in the mist of idle misery,"
9303,61,"life's purposes,—the palate of my mind"
9304,61,"losing its gust, and my ambition blind!"
9305,62,nymph of the downward smile and sidelong glance!
9306,62,in what diviner moments of the day
9307,62,art thou most lovely?—when gone far astray
9308,62,"into the labyrinths of sweet utterance,"
9309,62,or when serenely wandering in a trance
9310,62,"of sober thought? or when starting away,"
9311,62,"with careless robe to meet the morning ray,"
9312,62,thou sparest the flowers in thy mazy dance?
9313,62,"haply 'tis when thy ruby lips part sweetly,"
9314,62,"and so remain, because thou listenest,"
9315,62,but thou to please wert nurtured so completely
9316,62,that i can never tell what mood is best;
9317,62,i shall as soon pronounce which grace more neatly
9318,62,"trips it before apollo than the rest,"
9319,63,haydon! forgive me that i cannot speak
9320,63,definitively of these mighty things;
9321,63,"forgive me, that i have not eagle's wings,"
9322,63,"that what i want i know not where to seek,"
9323,63,"and think that i would not be over-meek,"
9324,63,"in rolling out upfollowed thunderings,"
9325,63,"even to the steep of heliconian springs,"
9326,63,"were i of ample strength for such a freak,"
9327,63,"think, too, that all these numbers should be thine;"
9328,63,whose else? in this who touch thy vesture's hem?
9329,63,"for, when men stared at what was most divine"
9330,63,"with brainless idiotism and o'erwise phlegm,"
9331,63,thou hadst beheld the full hesperian shine
9332,63,"of their star in the east, and gone to worship them!"
9333,64,"standing aloof in giant ignorance,"
9334,64,"        of thee i hear and of the cyclades,"
9335,64,    as one who sits ashore and longs perchance
9336,64,"        to visit dolphin-coral in deep seas,"
9337,64,"    so thou wast blind;--but then the veil was rent,"
9338,64,"        for jove uncurtain'd heaven to let thee live,"
9339,64,"    and neptune made for thee a spumy tent,"
9340,64,        and pan made sing for thee his forest-hive;
9341,64,"    aye on the shores of darkness there is light,"
9342,64,"        and precipices show untrodden green,"
9343,64,"    there is a budding morrow in midnight,"
9344,64,        there is a triple sight in blindness keen;
9345,64,"    such seeing hadst thou, as it once befell"
9346,64,"    to dian, queen of earth, and heaven, and hell,"
9347,65,"when by my solitary hearth i sit,"
9348,65,     and hateful thoughts enwrap my soul in gloom;
9349,65,"when no fair dreams before my mind's eye flit,"
9350,65,     and the bare heath of life presents no bloom;
9351,65,"           sweet hope, ethereal balm upon me shed,"
9352,65,           and wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!
9353,65,
9354,65,"whene'er i wander, at the fall of night,"
9355,65,"     where woven boughs shut out the moon's bright ray,"
9356,65,"should sad despondency my musings fright,"
9357,65,"     and frown, to drive fair cheerfulness away,"
9358,65,"           peep with the moonbeams through the leafy roof,"
9359,65,           and keep that fiend despondence far aloof!
9360,65,
9361,65,"should disappointment, parent of despair,"
9362,65,     strive for her son to seize my careless heart;
9363,65,"when, like a cloud, he sits upon the air,"
9364,65,"     preparing on his spell-bound prey to dart,"
9365,65,"           chase him away, sweet hope, with visage bright,"
9366,65,           and fright him as the morning frightens night!
9367,65,
9368,65,whene'er the fate of those i hold most dear
9369,65,"     tells to my fearful breast a tale of sorrow,"
9370,65,"o bright-eyed hope, my morbidfancy cheer;"
9371,65,"     let me awhile thy sweetest comforts borrow,"
9372,65,"           thy heaven-born radiance around me shed,"
9373,65,           and wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!
9374,65,
9375,65,"should e'er unhappy love my bosom pain,"
9376,65,"     from cruel parents, or relentless fair;"
9377,65,o let me think it is not quite in vain
9378,65,     to sigh out sonnets to the midnight air!
9379,65,"           sweet hope, ethereal balm upon me shed,"
9380,65,           and wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!
9381,65,
9382,65,"in the long vista of the years to roll,"
9383,65,"     let me not see our country's honour fade,"
9384,65,"o let me see our land retain her soul,"
9385,65,"     her pride, her freedom; and not freedom's shade,"
9386,65,           from thy bright eyes unusual brightness shed---
9387,65,           beneath thy pinions canopy my head!
9388,65,
9389,65,"let me not see the patriot's high bequest,"
9390,65,     great liberty! how great in plain attire!
9391,65,"with the base purple of a court oppress'd,"
9392,65,"     bowing her head, and ready to expire,"
9393,65,           but let me see thee stoop from heaven on wings
9394,65,           that fill the skies with silver glitterings!
9395,65,
9396,65,"and as, in sparkling majesty, a star"
9397,65,     gilds the bright summit of some gloomy cloud;
9398,65,"brightening the half veil'd face of heaven afar,"
9399,65,"     so, when dark thoughts my boding spirit shroud,"
9400,65,"           sweet hope, celestial influence round me shed,"
9401,65,           waving thy silver pinions o'er my head!
9402,66,"o that a week could be an age, and we"
9403,66,"felt parting and warm meeting every week,"
9404,66,"then one poor year a thousand years would be,"
9405,66,"the flush of welcome ever on the cheek,"
9406,66,"so could we live long life in little space,"
9407,66,"so time itself would be annihilate,"
9408,66,so a day's journey in oblivious haze
9409,66,"to serve ourjoys would lengthen and dilate,"
9410,66,o to arrive each monday morn from ind!
9411,66,to land each tuesday from the rich levant!
9412,66,"in little time a host of joys to bind,"
9413,66,and keep our souls in one eternal pant!
9414,66,"this morn, my friend, and yester-evening taught"
9415,66,"me how to harbour such a happy thought,"
9416,67,"cat! who hast pass’d thy grand climacteric,"
9417,67,  how many mice and rats hast in thy days
9418,67,  destroy’d? how many tit bits stolen? gaze
9419,67,"with those bright languid segments green, and prick"
9420,67,those velvet ears - but pr’ythee do not stick
9421,67,  thy latent talons in me - and upraise
9422,67,"  thy gentle mew - and tell me all thy frays,"
9423,67,"of fish and mice, and rats and tender chick,"
9424,67,"nay, look not down, nor lick thy dainty wrists -"
9425,67,  for all thy wheezy asthma - and for all
9426,67,thy tail’s tip is nick’d off - and though the fists
9427,67,"  of many a maid have given thee many a maul,"
9428,67,"still is that fur as soft, as when the lists"
9429,67,"  in youth thou enter’dest on glass bottled wall,"
9430,68,"many the wonders i this day have seen,"
9431,68,"the sun, when first he kissed away the tears"
9432,68,that filled the eyes of morn;—the laurelled peers
9433,68,who from the feathery gold of evening lean;—
9434,68,"the ocean with its vastness, its blue green,"
9435,68,"its ships, its rocks, its caves, its hopes, its fears,"
9436,68,"its voice mysterious, which whoso hears"
9437,68,"must think on what will be, and what has been,"
9438,68,"e'en now, dear george, while this for you i write,"
9439,68,cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping
9440,68,"so scantly, that it seems her bridal night,"
9441,68,"and she her half-discovered revels keeping,"
9442,68,"but what, without the social thought of thee,"
9443,68,would be the wonders of the sky and sea?
9444,69,"small, busy flames play through the fresh laid coals,"
9445,69,   and their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep
9446,69,   like whispers of the household gods that keep
9447,69,"a gentle empire o'er fraternal souls,"
9448,69,"and while, for rhymes, i search around the poles,"
9449,69,"   your eyes are fix d, as in poetic sleep,"
9450,69,"   upon the lore so voluble and deep,"
9451,69,"that aye at fall of night our care condoles,"
9452,69,"this is your birth-day tom, and i rejoice"
9453,69,"   that thus it passes smoothly, quietly,"
9454,69,many such eves of gently whisp'ring noise
9455,69,"    may we together pass, and calmly try"
9456,69,"what are this world s true joys, ere the great voice,"
9457,69,"    from its fair face, shall bid our spirits fly,"
9458,70,"to one who has been long in city pent,"
9459,70,        'tis very sweet to look into the fair
9460,70,"        and open face of heaven,--to breathe a prayer"
9461,70,"    full in the smile of the blue firmament,"
9462,70,"    who is more happy, when, with heart's content,"
9463,70,        fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
9464,70,"        of wavy grass, and reads a debonair"
9465,70,    and gentle tale of love and languishment?
9466,70,"    returning home at evening, with an ear"
9467,70,"        catching the notes of philomel,--an eye"
9468,70,"    watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career,"
9469,70,"        he mourns that day so soon has glided by,"
9470,70,    e'en like the passage of an angel's tear
9471,70,"        that falls through the clear ether silently,"
9472,71,o soft embalmer of the still midnight!
9473,71,"shutting, with careful fingers and benign,"
9474,71,"our gloom-pleas'd eyes, embower'd from the light,"
9475,71,    enshaded in forgetfulness divine;
9476,71,"o soothest sleep! if so it please thee, close,"
9477,71,"    in midst of this thine hymn, my willing eyes,"
9478,71,"or wait the amen, ere thy poppy throws"
9479,71,    around my bed its lulling charities;
9480,71,"    then save me, or the passed day will shine"
9481,71,"upon my pillow, breeding many woes;"
9482,71,"    save me from curious conscience, that still hoards"
9483,71,"its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole;"
9484,71,"    turn the key deftly in the oiled wards,"
9485,71,"and seal the hushed casket of my soul,"
9486,72,"o solitude! if i must with thee dwell,"
9487,72,    let it not be among the jumbled heap
9488,72,"    of murky buildings; climb with me the steep, --"
9489,72,"nature's observatory -- whence the dell,"
9490,72,"its flowery slopes, its river's crystal swell,"
9491,72,    may seem a span; let me thy vigils keep
9492,72,"    'mongst boughs pavilion'd, where the deer's swift leap"
9493,72,"startles the wild bee from the foxglove bell,"
9494,72,"but though i'll gladly trace these scenes with thee,"
9495,72,"    yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind,"
9496,72,"    whose words are images of thoughts refin'd,"
9497,72,is my soul's pleasure; and it sure must be
9498,72,"    almost the highest bliss of human-kind,"
9499,72,"when to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee,"
9500,73,son of the old moon-mountains african!
9501,73,chief of the pyramid and crocodile!
9502,73,"we call thee fruitful, and that very while"
9503,73,"a desert fills our seeing's inward span,"
9504,73,"nurse of swart nations since the world began,"
9505,73,art thou so fruitful? or dost thou beguile
9506,73,"such men to honour thee, who, worn with toil,"
9507,73,rest for a space 'twixt cairo and decan?
9508,73,o may dark fancies err! they surely do;
9509,73,'tis ignorance that makes a barren waste
9510,73,"of all beyond itself, thou dost bedew"
9511,73,"green rushes like our rivers, and dost taste"
9512,73,"the pleasant sunrise, green isles hast thou too,"
9513,73,"and to the sea as happily dost haste,"
9514,74,"had i a man's fair form, then might my sighs"
9515,74,"be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell,"
9516,74,"thine ear, and find thy gentle heart; so well"
9517,74,"would passion arm me for the enterprise,"
9518,74,but ah! i am no knight whose foeman dies;
9519,74,no cuirass glistens on my bosom's swell;
9520,74,i am no happy shepherd of the dell
9521,74,"whose lips have trembled with a maiden's eyes,"
9522,74,"yet must i dote upon thee,—call thee sweet,"
9523,74,sweeter by far than hybla's honied roses
9524,74,"when steeped in dew rich to intoxication,"
9525,74,"ah! i will taste that dew, for me 'tis meet,"
9526,74,"and when the moon her pallid face discloses,"
9527,74,"i'll gather some by spells, and incantation,"
9528,75,when i have fears that i may cease to be
9529,75,"        before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,"
9530,75,"    before high-piled books, in charactery,"
9531,75,        hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain;
9532,75,"    when i behold, upon the night's starr'd face,"
9533,75,"        huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,"
9534,75,    and think that i may never live to trace
9535,75,"        their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;"
9536,75,"    and when i feel, fair creature of an hour,"
9537,75,"        that i shall never look upon thee more,"
9538,75,    never have relish in the faery power
9539,75,        of unreflecting love;--then on the shore
9540,75,"    of the wide world i stand alone, and think"
9541,75,"    till love and fame to nothingness do sink,"
9542,76,"where be ye going, you devon maid?"
9543,76,     and what have ye there i' the basket?
9544,76,"ye tight little fairy, just fresh from the dairy,"
9545,76,     will ye give me some cream if i ask it?
9546,76,
9547,76,"i love your meads, and i love your flowers,"
9548,76,"     and i love your junkets mainly,"
9549,76,"but 'hind the door, i love kissing more,"
9550,76,     o look not so disdainly!
9551,76,
9552,76,"i love your hills, and i love your dales,"
9553,76,     and i love your flocks a-bleating;
9554,76,"but o, on the heather to lie together,"
9555,76,     with both our hearts a-beating!
9556,76,
9557,76,"i'll put your basket all safe in a nook,"
9558,76,"     your shawl i'll hang up on this willow,"
9559,76,"and we will sigh in the daisy's eye,"
9560,76,"     and kiss on a grass-green pillow,"
9561,77,"where's the poet? show him! show him,"
9562,77,"muses nine! that i may know him,"
9563,77,'tis the man who with a man
9564,77,"is an equal, be he king,"
9565,77,or poorest of the beggar-clan
9566,77,or any other wonderous thing
9567,77,a man may be 'twixt ape and plato;
9568,77,"'tis the man who with a bird,"
9569,77,"wren or eagle, finds his way to"
9570,77,all its instincts; he hath heard
9571,77,"the lion's roaring, and can tell"
9572,77,"what his horny throat expresseth,"
9573,77,and to him the tiger's yell
9574,77,come articulate and presseth
9575,77,"or his ear like mother-tongue,"
9576,78,why did i laugh tonight? no voice will tell
9577,78,"no god, no demon of severe response"
9578,78,deigns to reply from heaven or from hell
9579,78,"then to my human heart i turn at once,"
9580,78,"heart, thou and i are here, sad and alone,"
9581,78,"say, why did i laugh? o mortal pain!"
9582,78,o darkness! darkness! forever must i moan
9583,78,to question heaven and hell and heart in vain?
9584,78,why did i laugh? i know this being's lease
9585,78,my fancy to it's utmost blisses spreads
9586,78,yet would i on this very midnight cease
9587,78,and all the world's gaudy ensigns see in shreds
9588,78,"verse, fame and beauty are intense indeed"
9589,78,"but death intenser, death is life's high meed,"
9590,79,o golden-tongued romance with serene lute!
9591,79,fair plumed syren! queen of far away!
9592,79,"leave melodizing on this wintry day,"
9593,79,"shut up thine olden pages, and be mute,"
9594,79,adieu! for once again the fierce dispute
9595,79,betwixt damnation and impassioned clay
9596,79,must i burn through; once more humbly assay
9597,79,"the bitter-sweet of this shakespearean fruit,"
9598,79,"chief poet! and ye clouds of albion,"
9599,79,"begetters of our deep eternal theme,"
9600,79,"when through the old oak forest i am gone,"
9601,79,"let me not wander in a barren dream,"
9602,79,"but when i am consumed in the fire,"
9603,79,"give me new phoenix wings to fly at my desire,"
9604,80,"this pleasant tale is like a little copse,"
9605,80,"the honied lines so freshly interlace,"
9606,80,"to keep the reader in so sweet a place,"
9607,80,so that he here and there full-hearted stops;
9608,80,and oftentimes he feels the dewy drops
9609,80,"come cool and suddenly against his face,"
9610,80,"and, by the wandering melody, may trace"
9611,80,"which way the tender-legged linnet hops,"
9612,80,oh! what a power has white simplicity!
9613,80,what mighty power has this gentle story!
9614,80,"i, that do ever feel athirst for glory,"
9615,80,could at this moment be content to lie
9616,80,"meekly upon the grass, as those whose sobbings"
9617,80,"were heard of none beside the mournful robins,"
9618,81,"the church bells toll a melancholy round,"
9619,81,"calling the people to some other prayers,"
9620,81,"some other gloominess, more dreadful cares,"
9621,81,"more harkening to the sermon's horrid sound,"
9622,81,surely the mind of man is closely bound
9623,81,"in some blind spell, seeing that each one tears"
9624,81,"himself from fireside joys and lydian airs,"
9625,81,"and converse high of those with glory crowned,"
9626,81,"still, still they toll, and i should feel a damp,"
9627,81,"a chill as from a tomb, did i not know"
9628,81,"that they are dying like an outburnt lamp, -"
9629,81,"that 'tis their sighing, wailing, ere they go"
9630,81,"into oblivion -that fresh flowers will grow,"
9631,81,"and many glories of immortal stamp,"
9632,82,"what though, for showing truth to flattered state,"
9633,82,"kind hunt was shut in prison, yet has he,"
9634,82,"in his immortal spirit, been as free"
9635,82,"as the sky-searching lark, and as elate,"
9636,82,minion of grandeur! think you he did wait?
9637,82,"think you he nought but prison-walls did see,"
9638,82,"till, so unwilling, thou unturnedst the key?"
9639,82,"ah, no! far happier, nobler was his fate!"
9640,82,"in spenser's halls he strayed, and bowers fair,"
9641,82,culling enchanted flowers; and he flew
9642,82,"with daring milton through the fields of air,"
9643,82,to regions of his own his genius true
9644,82,"took happy flights, who shall his fame impair"
9645,82,"when thou art dead, and all thy wretched crew?"
