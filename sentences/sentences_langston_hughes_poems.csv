585,20,
586,20,"it never was america to me,"
587,20,
588,20,"o, let my land be a land where liberty"

590,20,"but opportunity is real, and life is free,"
591,20,"equality is in the air we breathe,"
592,20,

598,20,
599,20,"i am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,"
600,20,"i am the negro bearing slavery's scars,"
601,20,"i am the red man driven from the land,"
602,20,i am the immigrant clutching the hope i seek--
603,20,and finding only the same old stupid plan
604,20,"of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak,"
605,20,
606,20,"i am the young man, full of strength and hope,"

609,20,of grab the gold! of grab the ways of satisfying need!
610,20,of work the men! of take the pay!

619,20,"i am the man who never got ahead,"
620,20,"the poorest worker bartered through the years,"
621,20,
622,20,yet i'm the one who dreamt our basic dream
623,20,"in the old world while still a serf of kings,"
624,20,"who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,"
625,20,that even yet its mighty daring sings
626,20,"in every brick and stone, in every furrow turned"
627,20,"that's made america the land it has become,"
628,20,"o, i'm the man who sailed those early seas"
629,20,in search of what i meant to be my home--
630,20,"for i'm the one who left dark ireland's shore,"
631,20,"and poland's plain, and england's grassy lea,"
632,20,and torn from black africa's strand i came
633,20,"to build a homeland of the free,"

635,20,the free?
636,20,
637,20,who said the free?  not me?

639,20,the millions shot down when we strike?

645,20,the millions who have nothing for our pay--
646,20,"except the dream that's almost dead today,"
647,20,
648,20,"o, let america be america again--"
649,20,the land that never has been yet--
650,20,"and yet must be--the land where every man is free,"
651,20,"the land that's mine--the poor man's, indian's, negro's, me--"

659,20,"from those who live like leeches on the people's lives,"
660,20,"we must take back our land again,"
661,20,america!
662,20,
663,20,"o, yes,"
664,20,"i say it plain,"
665,20,"america never was america to me,"
666,20,and yet i swear this oath--
667,20,america will be!
668,20,
669,20,"out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,"
670,20,"the rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,"
671,20,"we, the people, must redeem"
672,20,"the land, the mines, the plants, the rivers,"
673,20,the mountains and the endless plain--
674,20,"all, all the stretch of these great green states--"
675,20,and make america again!
676,21,"i went down to the river,"
677,21,"i set down on the bank,"
678,21,"i tried to think but couldn't,"
679,21,"so i jumped in and sank,"
680,21,
681,21,i came up once and hollered!
682,21,i came up twice and cried!
683,21,if that water hadn't a-been so cold
684,21,"i might've sunk and died,"
685,21,
686,21,    but it was      cold in that water!      it was cold!
687,21,
688,21,i took the elevator
689,21,"sixteen floors above the ground,"
690,21,i thought about my baby
691,21,"and thought i would jump down,"
692,21,
693,21,i stood there and i hollered!
694,21,i stood there and i cried!
695,21,if it hadn't a-been so high

697,21,
698,21,    but it was      high up there!      it was high!
699,21,
700,21,"so since i'm still here livin',"
701,21,"i guess i will live on,"
702,21,i could've died for love--
703,21,but for livin' i was born
704,21,
705,21,"though you may hear me holler,"
706,21,and you may see me cry--
707,21,"i'll be dogged, sweet baby,"
708,21,"if you gonna see me die,"
709,21,
710,21,    life is fine!      fine as wine!      life is fine!

979,32,"i wish i'd never been born,"
980,33,"2 and 2 are 4,"
981,33,"4 and 4 are 8,"
982,33,
983,33,but what would happen
984,33,if the last 4 was late?
985,33,
986,33,and how would it be
987,33,if one 2 was me?
988,33,
989,33,or if the first 4 was you
990,33,divided by 2?
991,34,i would liken you
992,34,to a night without stars
993,34,"were it not for your eyes,"
994,34,i would liken you
995,34,to a sleep without dreams
996,34,"were it not for your songs,"
997,35,"how still,"
998,35,how strangely still
999,35,"the water is today,"
1000,35,it is not good
1001,35,for water
1002,35,"to be so still that way,"
1003,36,"been scared and battered,"
1004,36,"my hopes the wind done scattered,"
1005,36,"  snow has friz me,"
1006,36,"  sun has baked me,"
1007,36,
1008,36,looks like between 'em they done
1009,36,  tried to make me
1010,36,
1011,36,"stop laughin', stop lovin', stop livin'--"
1012,36,  but i don't care!
1013,36,  i'm still here!
1014,37,when the shoe strings break
1015,37,on both your shoes
1016,37,and you're in a hurry-
1017,37,"that's the blues,"
1018,37,
1019,37,when you go to buy a candy bar
1020,37,and you've lost the dime you had-
1021,37,slipped through a hole in your pocket somewhere-
1022,37,"that's the blues, too, and bad!"
1023,38,"bring me all of your dreams,"
1024,38,"you dreamer,"
1025,38,bring me all your
1026,38,heart melodies
1027,38,that i may wrap them
1028,38,in a blue cloud-cloth
1029,38,away from the too-rough fingers
1030,38,"of the world,"
1031,39,"children, i come back today"
1032,39,to tell you a story of the long dark way
1033,39,"that i had to climb, that i had to know"
1034,39,"in order that the race might live and grow,"
1035,39,look at my face -- dark as the night --  
1036,39,"yet shining like the sun with love's true light,"
1037,39,i am the dark girl who crossed the red sea
1038,39,"carrying in my body the seed of the free,"
1039,39,i am the woman who worked in the field
1040,39,"bringing the cotton and the corn to yield,"
1041,39,"i am the one who labored as a slave,"
1042,39,beaten and mistreated for the work that i gave --  
1043,39,"children sold away from me, husband sold, too,"
1044,39,"no safety , no love, no respect was i due,"
1045,39,
1046,39,"three hundred years in the deepest south,"
1047,39,"but god put a song and a prayer in my mouth ,"
1048,39,"god put a dream like steel in my soul,"
1049,39,"now, through my children, i'm reaching the goal,"
1050,39,
1051,39,"now, through my children, young and free,"
1052,39,"i realized the blessing deed to me,"
1053,39,"i couldn't read then, i couldn't write,"
1054,39,"i had nothing, back there in the night,"
1055,39,"sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,"
1056,39,"but i kept trudging on through the lonely years,"
1057,39,"sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,"
1058,39,"but i had to keep on till my work was done,"
1059,39,i had to keep on! no stopping for me --  
1060,39,"i was the seed of the coming free,"
1061,39,i nourished the dream that nothing could smother
1062,39,"deep in my breast -- the negro mother,"
1063,39,"i had only hope then , but now through you,"
1064,39,"dark ones of today, my dreams must come true,"
1065,39,"all you dark children in the world out there,"
1066,39,"remember my sweat, my pain, my despair,"
1067,39,"remember my years, heavy with sorrow --  "
1068,39,"and make of those years a torch for tomorrow,"
1069,39,make of my pass a road to the light
1070,39,"out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night,"
1071,39,"lift high my banner out of the dust,"
1072,39,"stand like free men supporting my trust,"
1073,39,"believe in the right, let none push you back,"
1074,39,"remember the whip and the slaver's track,"
1075,39,remember how the strong in struggle and strife
1076,39,"still bar you the way, and deny you life --  "
1077,39,"but march ever forward, breaking down bars,"
1078,39,"look ever upward at the sun and the stars,"
1079,39,"oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers"
1080,39,impel you forever up the great stairs --  
1081,39,for i will be with you till no white brother
1082,39,"dares keep down the children of the negro mother,"
1083,40,"i've known rivers,"
1084,40,i've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the
1085,40,"    flow of human blood in human veins,"
1086,40,
1087,40,"my soul has grown deep like the rivers,"
1088,40,
1089,40,"i bathed in the euphrates when dawns were young,"
1090,40,"i built my hut near the congo and it lulled me to sleep,"
1091,40,"i looked upon the nile and raised the pyramids above it,"
1092,40,i heard the singing of the mississippi when abe lincoln
1093,40,"    went down to new orleans, and i've seen its muddy"
1094,40,"    bosom turn all golden in the sunset,"
1095,40,
1096,40,"i've known rivers,"
1097,40,"ancient, dusky rivers,"
1098,40,
1099,40,"my soul has grown deep like the rivers,"
1100,41,"droning a drowsy syncopated tune,"
1101,41,"    rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,"
1102,41,"           i heard a negro play,"
1103,41,    down on lenox avenue the other night
1104,41,    by the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
1105,41,"           he did a lazy sway ,,"
1106,41,"           he did a lazy sway ,,"
1107,41,"    to the tune o' those weary blues,"
1108,41,    with his ebony hands on each ivory key
1109,41,"  he made that poor piano moan with melody,"
1110,41,         o blues!
1111,41,  swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
1112,41,"  he played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool,"
1113,41,          sweet blues!
1114,41,"  coming from a black man's soul,"
1115,41,         o blues!
1116,41,  in a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
1117,41,"  i heard that negro sing, that old piano moan--"
1118,41,"     ain't got nobody in all this world,"
1119,41,"         ain't got nobody but ma self,"
1120,41,         i's gwine to quit ma frownin'
1121,41,"         and put ma troubles on the shelf,"
1122,41,
1123,41,"  thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor,"
1124,41,  he played a few chords then he sang some more--
1125,41,      i got the weary blues
1126,41,"         and i can't be satisfied,"
1127,41,         got the weary blues
1128,41,         and can't be satisfied--
1129,41,         i ain't happy no mo'
1130,41,"         and i wish that i had died,"
1131,41,"  and far into the night he crooned that tune,"
1132,41,"  the stars went out and so did the moon,"
1133,41,  the singer stopped playing and went to bed
1134,41,"  while the weary blues echoed through his head,"
1135,41,"  he slept like a rock or a man that's dead,"
1136,42,"the instructor said,"
1137,42,
1138,42,   go home and write
1139,42,"   a page tonight,"
1140,42,   and let that page come out of you--
1141,42,"   then, it will be true,"
1142,42,
1143,42,i wonder if it's that simple?
1144,42,"i am twenty-two, colored, born in winston-salem,"
1145,42,"i went to school there, then durham, then here"
1146,42,"to this college on the hill above harlem,"
1147,42,"i am the only colored student in my class,"
1148,42,"the steps from the hill lead down into harlem,"
1149,42,"through a park, then i cross st, nicholas,"
1150,42,"eighth avenue, seventh, and i come to the y,"
1151,42,"the harlem branch y, where i take the elevator"
1152,42,"up to my room, sit down, and write this page,"
1153,42,
1154,42,it's not easy to know what is true for you or me
1155,42,"at twenty-two, my age, but i guess i'm what"
1156,42,"i feel and see and hear, harlem, i hear you,"
1157,42,"hear you, hear me--we two--you, me, talk on this page,"
1158,42,"i hear new york, too, me--who?"
1159,42,"well, i like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love,"
1160,42,"i like to work, read, learn, and understand life,"
1161,42,"i like a pipe for a christmas present,"
1162,42,"or records--bessie, bop, or bach,"
1163,42,i guess being colored doesn't make me not like
1164,42,"the same things other folks like who are other races,"
1165,42,so will my page be colored that i write?
1166,42,
1167,42,"being me, it will not be white,"
1168,42,but it will be
1169,42,"a part of you, instructor,"
1170,42,you are white--
1171,42,"yet a part of me, as i am a part of you,"
1172,42,"that's american,"
1173,42,"sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me,"
1174,42,"nor do i often want to be a part of you,"
1175,42,"but we are, that's true!"
1176,42,"as i learn from you,"
1177,42,i guess you learn from me--
1178,42,although you're older--and white--
1179,42,"and somewhat more free,"
1180,42,
1181,42,"this is my page for english b,"
1182,43,tell all my mourners
1183,43,to mourn in red --
1184,43,cause there ain't no sense
1185,43,"in my bein' dead,"
1186,44,"being walkers with the dawn and morning,"
1187,44,"walkers with the sun and morning,"
1188,44,"we are not afraid of night,"
1189,44,"nor days of gloom,"
1190,44,nor darkness--
1191,44,"being walkers with the sun and morning,"
