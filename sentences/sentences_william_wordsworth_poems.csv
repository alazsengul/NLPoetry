0,0,"'tis said, that some have died for love,"
1,0,and here and there a churchyard grave is found
2,0,"in the cold north's unhallowed ground,"
3,0,"because the wretched man himself had slain,"
4,0,"his love was such a grievous pain,"
5,0,and there is one whom i five years have known;
6,0,he dwells alone
7,0,"upon helvellyn's side,"
8,0,he loved--the pretty barbara died;
9,0,"and thus he makes his moan,"
10,0,three years had barbara in her grave been laid
11,0,"when thus his moan he made,"

13,0,"oh, move, thou cottage, from behind that oak!"
14,0,"or let the aged tree uprooted lie,"

29,0,"or sing another song, or choose another tree,"
30,0,

45,0,"to see thy arch thus stretch and bend,"
46,0,"thus rise and thus descend,--"
47,0,"disturbs me till the sight is more than i can dear,"

55,0,"within the sound of emma's voice, nor know"
56,0,"such happiness as i have known to-day,"
57,1,i marvel how nature could ever find space
58,1,"for so many strange contrasts in one human face,"
59,1,"there's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom"
60,1,"and bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom,"
61,1,
62,1,"there's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain;"
63,1,"such strength as, if ever affliction and pain"
64,1,"could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease,"
65,1,"would be rational peace--a philosopher's ease,"
66,1,
67,1,"there's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds,"
68,1,and attention full ten times as much as there needs;
69,1,"pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy;"
70,1,"and mildness, and spirit both forward and coy,"
71,1,
72,1,"there's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare"
73,1,"of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there,"
74,1,"there's virtue, the title it surely may claim,"
75,1,"yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name,"
76,1,
77,1,"this picture from nature may seem to depart,"
78,1,yet the man would at once run away with your heart;
79,1,and i for five centuries right gladly would be
80,1,"such an odd such a kind happy creature as he,"
81,2,there is a change--and i am poor;
82,2,"your love hath been, nor long ago,"
83,2,"a fountain at my fond heart's door,"
84,2,whose only business was to flow;
85,2,and flow it did; not taking heed
86,2,"of its own bounty, or my need,"
87,2,what happy moments did i count!
88,2,blest was i then all bliss above!
89,2,"now, for that consecrated fount"
90,2,"of murmuring, sparkling, living love,"
91,2,what have i? shall i dare to tell?
92,2,"a comfortless and hidden well,"
93,2,
94,2,a well of love--it may be deep--
95,2,"i trust it is,--and never dry,"
96,2,what matter? if the waters sleep
97,2,"in silence and obscurity,"
98,2,"--such change, and at the very door"
99,2,"of my fond heart, hath made me poor,"
100,3,"a narrow girdle of rough stones and crags,"
101,3,"a rude and natural causeway, interposed"
102,3,between the water and a winding slope
103,3,"of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore"
104,3,"of grasmere safe in its own privacy,"
105,3,"and there myself and two beloved friends,"
106,3,"one calm september morning, ere the mist"
107,3,"had altogether yielded to the sun,"
108,3,"sauntered on this retired and difficult way,"
109,3,----ill suits the road with one in haste; but we
110,3,"played with our time; and, as we strolled along,"
111,3,it was our occupation to observe
112,3,such objects as the waves had tossed ashore--
113,3,"feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough,"
114,3,"each on the other heaped, along the line"
115,3,"of the dry wreck, and, in our vacant mood,"
116,3,not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft
117,3,"of dandelion seed or thistle's beard,"
118,3,"that skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake,"
119,3,suddenly halting now--a lifeless stand!
120,3,and starting off again with freak as sudden;
121,3,"in all its sportive wanderings, all the while,"
122,3,making report of an invisible breeze
123,3,"that was its wings, its chariot, and its horse,"
124,3,"its playmate, rather say, its moving soul,"
125,3,"--and often, trifling with a privilege"
126,3,"alike indulged to all, we paused, one now,"
127,3,"and now the other, to point out, perchance"
128,3,"to pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair"
129,3,either to be divided from the place
130,3,"on which it grew, or to be left alone"
131,3,"to its own beauty, many such there are,"
132,3,"fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern,"
133,3,"so stately, of the queen osmunda named;"
134,3,"plant lovelier, in its own retired abode"
135,3,"on grasmere's beach, than naiad by the side"
136,3,"of grecian brook, or lady of the mere,"
137,3,"sole-sitting by the shores of old romance,"
138,3,"--so fared we that bright morning, from the fields"
139,3,"meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth"
140,3,"of reapers, men and women, boys and girls,"
141,3,"delighted much to listen to those sounds,"
142,3,"and feeding thus our fancies, we advanced"
143,3,"along the indented shore; when suddenly,"
144,3,through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen
145,3,"before us, on a point of jutting land,"
146,3,the tall and upright figure of a man
147,3,"attired in peasant's garb, who stood alone,"
148,3,"angling beside the margin of the lake,"
149,3,"improvident and reckless, we exclaimed,"
150,3,"the man must be, who thus can lose a day"
151,3,"of the mid harvest, when the labourer's hire"
152,3,"is ample, and some little might be stored"
153,3,"wherewith to cheer him in the winter time,"
154,3,"thus talking of that peasant, we approached"
155,3,close to the spot where with his rod and line
156,3,he stood alone; whereat he turned his head
157,3,to greet us--and we saw a mam worn down
158,3,"by sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks"
159,3,"and wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean"
160,3,"that for my single self i looked at them,"
161,3,"forgetful of the body they sustained,--"
162,3,"too weak to labour in the harvest field,"
163,3,the man was using his best skill to gain
164,3,a pittance from the dead unfeeling lake
165,3,"that knew not of his wants, i will not say"
166,3,"what thoughts immediately were ours, nor how"
167,3,"the happy idleness of that sweet morn,"
168,3,"with all its lovely images, was changed"
169,3,"to serious musing and to self-reproach,"
170,3,nor did we fail to see within ourselves
171,3,"what need there is to be reserved in speech,"
172,3,"and temper all our thoughts with charity,"
173,3,"--therefore, unwilling to forget that day,"
174,3,"my friend, myself, and she who then received"
175,3,"the same admonishment, have called the place"
176,3,"by a memorial name, uncouth indeed"
177,3,as e'er by mariner was given to bay
178,3,"or foreland, on a new-discovered coast;"
179,3,"and point rash-judgment is the name it bears,"
180,4,lo! where the moon along the sky
181,4,sails with her happy destiny;
182,4,oft is she hid from mortal eye
183,4,"or dimly seen,"
184,4,but when the clouds asunder fly
185,4,how bright her mien!
186,4,
187,4,"far different we--a froward race,"
188,4,thousands though rich in fortune's grace
189,4,with cherished sullenness of pace
190,4,"their way pursue,"
191,4,ingrates who wear a smileless face
192,4,"the whole year through,"
193,4,
194,4,if kindred humours e'er would make
195,4,"my spirit droop for drooping's sake,"
196,4,"from fancy following in thy wake,"
197,4,bright ship of heaven!
198,4,a counter impulse let me take
199,4,"and be forgiven,"
200,5,------the sky is overcast
201,5,"with a continuous cloud of texture close,"
202,5,"heavy and wan, all whitened by the moon,"
203,5,"which through that veil is indistinctly seen,"
204,5,"a dull, contracted circle, yielding light"
205,5,"so feebly spread, that not a shadow falls,"
206,5,"chequering the ground--from rock, plant, tree, or tower,"
207,5,at length a pleasant instantaneous gleam
208,5,startles the pensive traveller while he treads
209,5,"his lonesome path, with unobserving eye"
210,5,bent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split
211,5,"asunder,--and above his head he sees"
212,5,"the clear moon, and the glory of the heavens,"
213,5,"there, in a black-blue vault she sails along,"
214,5,"followed by multitudes of stars, that, small"
215,5,"and sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss"
216,5,"drive as she drives, how fast they wheel away,"
217,5,"yet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree,"
218,5,but they are silent;--still they roll along
219,5,"immeasurably distant; and the vault,"
220,5,"built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,"
221,5,"still deepens its unfathomable depth,"
222,5,"at length the vision closes; and the mind,"
223,5,"not undisturbed by the delight it feels,"
224,5,"which slowly settles into peaceful calm,"
225,5,"is left to muse upon the solemn scene,"
226,6,",    a poet!--he hath put his heart to school,"
227,6,   nor dares to move unpropped upon the staff
228,6,   which art hath lodged within his hand--must laugh
229,6,"   by precept only, and shed tears by rule,"
230,6,"   thy art be nature; the live current quaff,"
231,6,"   and let the groveller sip his stagnant pool,"
232,6,"   in fear that else, when critics grave and cool"
233,6,"   have killed him, scorn should write his epitaph,"
234,6,   how does the meadow-flower its bloom unfold?
235,6,  because the lovely little flower is free
236,6,"  down to its root, and, in that freedom, bold;"
237,6,  and so the grandeur of the forest-tree
238,6,"  comes not by casting in a formal mould,"
239,6,"  but from its own divine vitality,"
240,7,art thou a statist in the van
241,7,of public conflicts trained and bred?
242,7,--first learn to love one living man;
243,7,"'then' may'st thou think upon the dead,"
244,7,
245,7,a lawyer art thou?--draw not nigh!
246,7,"go, carry to some fitter place"
247,7,"the keenness of that practised eye,"
248,7,"the hardness of that sallow face,"
249,7,
250,7,art thou a man of purple cheer?
251,7,"a rosy man, right plump to see?"
252,7,"approach; yet, doctor, not too near,"
253,7,"this grave no cushion is for thee,"
254,7,
255,7,"or art thou one of gallant pride,"
256,7,a soldier and no man of chaff?
257,7,"welcome!--but lay thy sword aside,"
258,7,"and lean upon a peasant's staff,"
259,7,
260,7,"physician art thou? one, all eyes,"
261,7,"philosopher! a fingering slave,"
262,7,one that would peep and botanise
263,7,upon his mother's grave?
264,7,
265,7,"wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece,"
266,7,"o turn aside,--and take, i pray,"
267,7,"that he below may rest in peace,"
268,7,"thy ever-dwindling soul, away!"
269,7,
270,7,a moralist perchance appears;
271,7,"led, heaven knows how! to this poor sod,"
272,7,and he has neither eyes nor ears;
273,7,"himself his world, and his own god;"
274,7,
275,7,one to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling
276,7,"nor form, nor feeling, great or small;"
277,7,"a reasoning, self-sufficing thing,"
278,7,an intellectual all-in-all!
279,7,
280,7,shut close the door; press down the latch;
281,7,sleep in thy intellectual crust;
282,7,nor lose ten tickings of thy watch
283,7,"near this unprofitable dust,"
284,7,
285,7,"but who is he, with modest looks,"
286,7,and clad in homely russet brown?
287,7,he murmurs near the running brooks
288,7,"a music sweeter than their own,"
289,7,
290,7,"he is retired as noontide dew,"
291,7,or fountain in a noon-day grove;
292,7,"and you must love him, ere to you"
293,7,"he will seem worthy of your love,"
294,7,
295,7,"the outward shows of sky and earth,"
296,7,"of hill and valley, he has viewed;"
297,7,and impulses of deeper birth
298,7,"have come to him in solitude,"
299,7,
300,7,in common things that round us lie
301,7,"some random truths he can impart,--"
302,7,the harvest of a quiet eye
303,7,"that broods and sleeps on his own heart,"
304,7,
305,7,"but he is weak; both man and boy,"
306,7,hath been an idler in the land;
307,7,contented if he might enjoy
308,7,"the things which others understand,"
309,7,
310,7,--come hither in thy hour of strength;
311,7,"come, weak as is a breaking wave!"
312,7,here stretch thy body at full length;
313,7,"or build thy house upon this grave,"
314,8,a whirl-blast from behind the hill
315,8,rushed o'er the wood with startling sound;
316,8,"then--all at once the air was still,"
317,8,"and showers of hailstones pattered round,"
318,8,"where leafless oaks towered high above,"
319,8,i sat within an undergrove
320,8,"of tallest hollies, tall and green;"
321,8,"a fairer bower was never seen,"
322,8,from year to year the spacious floor
323,8,"with withered leaves is covered o'er,"
324,8,"and all the year the bower is green,"
325,8,but see! where'er the hailstones drop
326,8,the withered leaves all skip and hop;
327,8,there's not a breeze--no breath of air--
328,8,"yet here, and there, and everywhere"
329,8,"along the floor, beneath the shade"
330,8,"by those embowering hollies made,"
331,8,"the leaves in myriads jump and spring,"
332,8,as if with pipes and music rare
333,8,"some robin good-fellow were there,"
334,8,"and all those leaves, in festive glee,"
335,8,"were dancing to the minstrelsy,"
336,9,among the dwellings framed by birds
337,9,"    in field or forest with nice care,"
338,9,is none that with the little wren's
339,9,"    in snugness may compare,"
340,9,
341,9,"no door the tenement requires,"
342,9,    and seldom needs a laboured roof;
343,9,yet is it to the fiercest sun
344,9,"    impervious, and storm-proof,"
345,9,
346,9,"so warm, so beautiful withal,"
347,9,"    in perfect fitness for its aim,"
348,9,that to the kind by special grace
349,9,"    their instinct surely came,"
350,9,
351,9,and when for their abodes they seek
352,9,"    an opportune recess,"
353,9,the hermit has no finer eye
354,9,"    for shadowy quietness,"
355,9,
356,9,"these find, 'mid ivied abbey-walls,"
357,9,    a canopy in some still nook;
358,9,others are pent-housed by a brae
359,9,"    that overhangs a brook,"
360,9,
361,9,there to the brooding bird her mate
362,9,    warbles by fits his low clear song;
363,9,and by the busy streamlet both
364,9,"    are sung to all day long,"
365,9,
366,9,"or in sequestered lanes they build,"
367,9,"    where, till the flitting bird's return,"
368,9,"her eggs within the nest repose,"
369,9,"    like relics in an urn,"
370,9,
371,9,"but still, where general choice is good,"
372,9,    there is a better and a best;
373,9,"and, among fairest objects, some"
374,9,    are fairer than the rest;
375,9,
376,9,"this, one of those small builders proved"
377,9,"    in a green covert, where, from out"
378,9,"the forehead of a pollard oak,"
379,9,    the leafy antlers sprout;
380,9,
381,9,"for she who planned the mossy lodge,"
382,9,"    mistrusting her evasive skill,"
383,9,had to a primrose looked for aid
384,9,"    her wishes to fulfill,"
385,9,
386,9,"high on the trunk's projecting brow,"
387,9,    and fixed an infant's span above
388,9,"the budding flowers, peeped forth the nest"
389,9,    the prettiest of the grove!
390,9,
391,9,the treasure proudly did i show
392,9,    to some whose minds without disdain
393,9,can turn to little things; but once
394,9,"    looked up for it in vain,"
395,9,
396,9,"'tis gone---a ruthless spoiler's prey,"
397,9,"    who heeds not beauty, love, or song,"
398,9,'tis gone! so seemed it and we grieved
399,9,"    indignant at the wrong,"
400,9,
401,9,"just three days after, passing by"
402,9,    in clearer light the moss-built cell
403,9,"i saw, espied its shaded mouth;"
404,9,"    and felt that all was well,"
405,9,
406,9,the primrose for a veil had spread
407,9,    the largest of her upright leaves;
408,9,"and thus, for purposes benign,"
409,9,"    a simple flower deceives,"
410,9,
411,9,concealed from friends who might disturb
412,9,"    thy quiet with no ill intent,"
413,9,secure from evil eyes and hands
414,9,"    on barbarous plunder bent,"
415,9,
416,9,"rest, mother-bird! and when thy young"
417,9,"    take flight, and thou art free to roam,"
418,9,"when withered is the guardian flower,"
419,9,"    and empty thy late home,"
420,9,
421,9,"think how ye prospered, thou and thine,"
422,9,    amid the unviolated grove
423,9,housed near the growing primrose-tuft
424,9,"    in foresight, or in love,"
425,10,",   i thought of thee, my partner and my guide,"
426,10,"   as being past away,--vain sympathies!"
427,10,"   for, backward, duddon! as i cast my eyes,"
428,10,"   i see what was, and is, and will abide;"
429,10,"   still glides the stream, and shall for ever glide;"
430,10,"   the form remains, the function never dies;"
431,10,"   while we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,"
432,10,"   we men, who in our morn of youth defied"
433,10,"   the elements, must vanish;--be it so!"
434,10,"  enough, if something from our hands have power"
435,10,"  to live, and act, and serve the future hour;"
436,10,"  and if, as toward the silent tomb we go,"
437,10,"  through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,"
438,10,"  we feel that we are greater than we know,"
439,11,i have a boy of five years old;
440,11,his face is fair and fresh to see;
441,11,his limbs are cast in beauty's mold
442,11,"and dearly he loves me,"
443,11,
444,11,"one morn we strolled on our dry walk,"
445,11,"or quiet home all full in view,"
446,11,and held such intermitted talk
447,11,"as we are wont to do,"
448,11,
449,11,my thoughts on former pleasures ran;
450,11,"i thought of kilve's delightful shore,"
451,11,"our pleasant home when spring began,"
452,11,"a long, long year before,"
453,11,
454,11,a day it was when i could bear
455,11,some fond regrets to entertain;
456,11,"with so much happiness to spare,"
457,11,"i could not feel a pain,"
458,11,
459,11,the green earth echoed to the feet
460,11,"of lambs that bounded through the glade,"
461,11,"from shade to sunshine, and as fleet"
462,11,"from sunshine back to shade,"
463,11,
464,11,birds warbled round me---and each trace
465,11,of inward sadness had its charm;
466,11,"kilve, thought i, was a favoured place,"
467,11,"and so is liswyn farm,"
468,11,
469,11,"my boy beside me tripped, so slim"
470,11,and graceful in his rustic dress!
471,11,"and, as we talked, i questioned him,"
472,11,"in very idleness,"
473,11,
474,11,"now tell me, had you rather be,"
475,11,"i said, and took him by the arm,"
476,11,"on kilve's smooth shore, by the green sea,"
477,11,or here at liswyn farm?
478,11,
479,11,"in careless mood he looked at me,"
480,11,"while still i held him by the arm,"
481,11,"and said, at kilve i'd rather be"
482,11,"than here at liswyn farm,"
483,11,
484,11,"now, little edward, say why so,"
485,11,"my little edward, tell me why,---"
486,11,"i cannot tell, i do not know,---"
487,11,"why, this is strange, said i;"
488,11,
489,11,"for, here are woods, hills smooth and warm,"
490,11,there surely must one reason be
491,11,why you would change sweet liswyn farm
492,11,"for kilve by the green sea,"
493,11,
494,11,"at this, my boy hung down his head,"
495,11,"he blushed with shame, nor made reply;"
496,11,"and three times to the child i said,"
497,11,"why, ,edward, tell me why?"
498,11,
499,11,"his head he raised---there was in sight,"
500,11,"it caught his eye, he saw it plain---"
501,11,"upon the house-top, glittering bright,"
502,11,"a broad and gilded vane,"
503,11,
504,11,"then did the boy his tongue unlock,"
505,11,"and eased his mind with this reply,"
506,11,at kilve there was no weather-cock;
507,11,"and that's the reason why,"
508,11,
509,11,"o dearest, dearest boy! my heart"
510,11,"for better lore would seldom yearn,"
511,11,could i but teach the hundredth part
512,11,"of what from thee i learn,"
513,12,"the little hedgerow birds,"
514,12,"that peck along the roads, regard him not,"
515,12,"he travels on, and in his face, his step,"
516,12,"his gait, is one expression, every limb,"
517,12,"his look and bending figure, all bespeak"
518,12,"a man who does not move with pain, but moves"
519,12,"with thought,--he is insensibly subdued"
520,12,"to settled quiet, he is one by whom"
521,12,all effort seems forgotten; one to whom
522,12,"long patience hath such mild composure given,"
523,12,that patience now doth seem a thing of which
524,12,"he hath no need, he is by nature led"
525,12,to peace so perfect that the young behold
526,12,"with envy, what the old man hardly feels,"
527,13,"the sun is couched, the sea-fowl gone to rest,"
528,13,and the wild storm hath somewhere found a nest;
529,13,"air slumbers--wave with wave no longer strives,"
530,13,"only a heaving of the deep survives,"
531,13,"a tell-tale motion! soon will it be laid,"
532,13,"and by the tide alone the water swayed,"
533,13,"stealthy withdrawings, interminglings mild"
534,13,of light with shade in beauty reconciled--
535,13,"such is the prospect far as sight can range,"
536,13,"the soothing recompence, the welcome change,"
537,13,"where, now, the ships that drove before the blast,"
538,13,threatened by angry breakers as they passed;
539,13,and by a train of flying clouds bemocked;
540,13,"or, in the hollow surge, at anchor rocked"
541,13,"as on a bed of death? some lodge in peace,"
542,13,saved by his care who bade the tempest cease;
543,13,"and some, too heedless of past danger, court"
544,13,fresh gales to waft them to the far-off port
545,13,"but near, or hanging sea and sky between,"
546,13,"not one of all those winged powers is seen,"
547,13,"seen in her course, nor 'mid this quiet heard;"
548,13,yet oh! how gladly would the air be stirred
549,13,"by some acknowledgment of thanks and praise,"
550,13,soft in its temper as those vesper lays
551,13,sung to the virgin while accordant oars
552,13,urge the slow bark along calabrian shores;
553,13,a sea-born service through the mountains felt
554,13,"till into one loved vision all things melt,"
555,13,or like those hymns that soothe with graver sound
556,13,the gulfy coast of norway iron-bound;
557,13,"and, from the wide and open baltic, rise"
558,13,"with punctual care, lutherian harmonies,"
559,13,"hush, not a voice is here! but why repine,"
560,13,now when the star of eve comes forth to shine
561,13,on british waters with that look benign?
562,13,"ye mariners, that plough your onward way,"
563,13,"or in the haven rest, or sheltering bay,"
564,13,may silent thanks at least to god be given
565,13,"with a full heart; our thoughts are 'heard' in heaven,"
566,14,"calm is all nature as a resting wheel,"
567,14,the kine are couched upon the dewy grass;
568,14,"the horse alone, seen dimly as i pass,"
569,14,"is cropping audibly his later meal,"
570,14,dark is the ground; a slumber seems to steal
571,14,"o'er vale, and mountain, and the starless sky,"
572,14,"now, in this blank of things, a harmony,"
573,14,"home-felt, and home-created, comes to heal"
574,14,that grief for which the senses still supply
575,14,"fresh food; for only then, when memory"
576,14,"is hushed, am i at rest, my friends! restrain"
577,14,those busy cares that would allay my pain;
578,14,"oh! leave me to myself, nor let me feel"
579,14,"the officious touch that makes me droop again,"
580,15,",   who is the happy warrior? who is he"
581,15,   that every man in arms should wish to be?
582,15,"   --it is the generous spirit, who, when brought"
583,15,"   among the tasks of real life, hath wrought"
584,15,"   upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought,"
585,15,   whose high endeavours are an inward light
586,15,   that makes the path before him always bright;
587,15,"   who, with a natural instinct to discern"
588,15,"   what knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;"
589,15,"  abides by this resolve, and stops not there,"
590,15,  but makes his moral being his prime care;
591,15,"  who, doomed to go in company with pain,"
592,15,"  and fear, and bloodshed, miserable train!"
593,15,  turns his necessity to glorious gain;
594,15,  in face of these doth exercise a power
595,15,"  which is our human nature's highest dower,"
596,15,"  controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves"
597,15,"  of their bad influence, and their good receives,"
598,15,"  by objects, which might force the soul to abate"
599,15,"  her feeling, rendered more compassionate;"
600,15,  is placable--because occasions rise
601,15,  so often that demand such sacrifice;
602,15,"  more skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure,"
603,15,"  as tempted more; more able to endure,"
604,15,  as more exposed to suffering and distress;
605,15,"  thence, also, more alive to tenderness,"
606,15,  --'tis he whose law is reason; who depends
607,15,  upon that law as on the best of friends;
608,15,"  whence, in a state where men are tempted still"
609,15,"  to evil for a guard against worse ill,"
610,15,  and what in quality or act is best
611,15,"  doth seldom on a right foundation rest,"
612,15,"  he labours good on good to fix, and owes"
613,15,"  to virtue every triumph that he knows,"
614,15,"  --who, if he rise to station of command,"
615,15,  rises by open means; and there will stand
616,15,"  on honourable terms, or else retire,"
617,15,  and in himself possess his own desire;
618,15,"  who comprehends his trust, and to the same"
619,15,  keeps faithful with a singleness of aim;
620,15,"  and therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait"
621,15,"  for wealth, or honours, or for worldly state;"
622,15,"  whom they must follow; on whose head must fall,"
623,15,"  like showers of manna, if they come at all,"
624,15,"  whose powers shed round him in the common strife,"
625,15,"  or mild concerns of ordinary life,"
626,15,"  a constant influence, a peculiar grace;"
627,15,"  but who, if he be called upon to face"
628,15,  some awful moment to which heaven has joined
629,15,"  great issues, good or bad for human kind,"
630,15,  is happy as a lover; and attired
631,15,"  with sudden brightness, like a man inspired;"
632,15,"  and, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law"
633,15,"  in calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;"
634,15,"  or if an unexpected call succeed,"
635,15,"  come when it will, is equal to the need,"
636,15,"  --he who, though thus endued as with a sense"
637,15,"  and faculty for storm and turbulence,"
638,15,  is yet a soul whose master-bias leans
639,15,  to homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes;
640,15,"  sweet images! which, wheresoe'er he be,"
641,15,  are at his heart; and such fidelity
642,15,  it is his darling passion to approve;
643,15,"  more brave for this, that he hath much to love,--"
644,15,"  'tis, finally, the man, who, lifted high,"
645,15,"  conspicuous object in a nation's eye,"
646,15,"  or left unthought-of in obscurity,--"
647,15,"  who, with a toward or untoward lot,"
648,15,"  prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not--"
649,15,"  plays, in the many games of life, that one"
650,15,"  where what he most doth value must be won,"
651,15,"  whom neither shape or danger can dismay,"
652,15,  nor thought of tender happiness betray;
653,15,"  who, not content that former worth stand fast,"
654,15,"  looks forward, persevering to the last,"
655,15,"  from well to better, daily self-surpast,"
656,15,"  who, whether praise of him must walk the earth"
657,15,"  for ever, and to noble deeds give birth,"
658,15,"  or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,"
659,15,  and leave a dead unprofitable name--
660,15,  finds comfort in himself and in his cause;
661,15,"  and, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws"
662,15,"  his breath in confidence of heaven's applause,"
663,15,  this is the happy warrior; this is he
664,15,"  that every man in arms should wish to be,"
665,16,"one who was suffering tumult in his soul,"
666,16,"yet failed to seek the sure relief of prayer,"
667,16,went forth--his course surrendering to the care
668,16,"of the fierce wind, while mid-day lightnings prowl"
669,16,"insidiously, untimely thunders growl;"
670,16,"while trees, dim-seen, in frenzied numbers, tear"
671,16,"the lingering remnant of their yellow hair,"
672,16,"and shivering wolves, surprised with darkness, howl"
673,16,"as if the sun were not, he raised his eye"
674,16,"soul-smitten; for, that instant, did appear"
675,16,"large space 'mid dreadful clouds of purest sky,"
676,16,an azure disc--shield of tranquillity;
677,16,"invisible, unlooked-for, minister"
678,16,of providential goodness ever nigh!
679,17,"earth has not anything to show more fair,"
680,17,   dull would he be of soul who could pass by
681,17,"   a sight so touching in its majesty,"
682,17,"   this city now doth, like a garment, wear"
683,17,"   the beauty of the morning; silent, bare,"
684,17,"   ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie"
685,17,"   open unto the fields, and to the sky;"
686,17,"   all bright and glittering in the smokeless air,"
687,17,   never did sun more beautifully steep
688,17,"  in his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;"
689,17,"  ne'er saw i, never felt, a calm so deep!"
690,17,"  the river glideth at his own sweet will,"
691,17,  dear god! the very houses seem asleep;
692,17,  and all that mighty heart is lying still!
693,18,",  see plutarch,"
694,18,"    serene, and fitted to embrace,"
695,18,"   where'er he turned, a swan-like grace"
696,18,"   of haughtiness without pretence,"
697,18,"   and to unfold a still magnificence,"
698,18,"   was princely dion, in the power"
699,18,"   and beauty of his happier hour,"
700,18,   and what pure homage then did wait
701,18,"   on dion's virtues, while the lunar beam"
702,18,"   of plato's genius, from its lofty sphere,"
703,18,"  fell round him in the grove of academe,"
704,18,  softening their inbred dignity austere--
705,18,"    that he, not too elate"
706,18,"    with self-sufficing solitude,"
707,18,"  but with majestic lowliness endued,"
708,18,"  might in the universal bosom reign,"
709,18,  and from affectionate observance gain
710,18,"  help, under every change of adverse fate,"
711,18,
712,18,   five thousand warriors--o the rapturous day!
713,18,"  each crowned with flowers, and armed with spear and shield,"
714,18,"  or ruder weapon which their course might yield,"
715,18,"  to syracuse advance in bright array,"
716,18,  who leads them on?--the anxious people see
717,18,"  long-exiled dion marching at their head,"
718,18,"  he also crowned with flowers of sicily,"
719,18,"  and in a white, far-beaming, corslet clad!"
720,18,  pure transport undisturbed by doubt or fear
721,18,"  the gazers feel; and, rushing to the plain,"
722,18,  salute those strangers as a holy train
723,18,  or blest procession to the immortals dear
724,18,"  that brought their precious liberty again,"
725,18,"  lo! when the gates are entered, on each hand,"
726,18,"  down the long street, rich goblets filled with wine"
727,18,"    in seemly order stand,"
728,18,"  on tables set, as if for rites divine;--"
729,18,"  and, as the great deliverer marches by,"
730,18,  he looks on festal ground with fruits bestrown;
731,18,  and flowers are on his person thrown
732,18,    in boundless prodigality;
733,18,"  nor doth the general voice abstain from prayer,"
734,18,"  invoking dion's tutelary care,"
735,18,  as if a very deity he were!
736,18,
737,18,"   mourn, hills and groves of attica! and mourn,"
738,18,"  ilissus, bending o'er thy classic urn!"
739,18,"  mourn, and lament for him whose spirit dreads"
740,18,"  your once sweet memory, studious walks and shades!"
741,18,"  for him who to divinity aspired,"
742,18,"  not on the breath of popular applause,"
743,18,  but through dependence on the sacred laws
744,18,"  framed in the schools where wisdom dwelt retired,"
745,18,  intent to trace the ideal path of right
746,18,  more fair than heaven's broad causeway paved with stars
747,18,  which dion learned to measure with sublime delight;--
748,18,  but he hath overleaped the eternal bars;
749,18,"  and, following guides whose craft holds no consent"
750,18,"  with aught that breathes the ethereal element,"
751,18,"  hath stained the robes of civil power with blood,"
752,18,"  unjustly shed, though for the public good,"
753,18,"  whence doubts that came too late, and wishes vain,"
754,18,"  hollow excuses, and triumphant pain;"
755,18,  and oft his cogitations sink as low
756,18,"  as, through the abysses of a joyless heart,"
757,18,  the heaviest plummet of despair can go--
758,18,  but whence that sudden check? that fearful start!
759,18,    he hears an uncouth sound--
760,18,    anon his lifted eyes
761,18,"  saw, at a long-drawn gallery's dusky bound,"
762,18,  a shape of more than mortal size
763,18,"  and hideous aspect, stalking round and round!"
764,18,"    a woman's garb the phantom wore,"
765,18,"    and fiercely swept the marble floor,--"
766,18,"    like auster whirling to and fro,"
767,18,    his force on caspian foam to try;
768,18,  or boreas when he scours the snow
769,18,"  that skims the plains of thessaly,"
770,18,  or when aloft on mænalus he stops
771,18,"  his flight, 'mid eddying pine-tree tops!"
772,18,
773,18,"   so, but from toil less sign of profit reaping,"
774,18,"  the sullen spectre to her purpose bowed,"
775,18,  sweeping--vehemently sweeping--
776,18,"  no pause admitted, no design avowed!"
777,18,"  avaunt, inexplicable guest!--avaunt,"
778,18,  exclaimed the chieftain--let me rather see
779,18,  the coronal that coiling vipers make;
780,18,"  the torch that flames with many a lurid flake,"
781,18,  and the long train of doleful pageantry
782,18,"  which they behold, whom vengeful furies haunt;"
783,18,"  who, while they struggle from the scourge to flee,"
784,18,"  move where the blasted soil is not unworn,"
785,18,"  and, in their anguish, bear what other minds have borne!"
786,18,
787,18,"   but shapes, that come not at an earthly call,"
788,18,  will not depart when mortal voices bid;
789,18,"  lords of the visionary eye whose lid,"
790,18,"  once raised, remains aghast, and will not fall!"
791,18,"  ye gods, thought he, that servile implement"
792,18,    obeys a mystical intent!
793,18,  your minister would brush away
794,18,  the spots that to my soul adhere;
795,18,"  but should she labour night and day,"
796,18,"  they will not, cannot disappear;"
797,18,"  whence angry perturbations,--and that look"
798,18,  which no philosophy can brook!
799,18,
800,18,   ill-fated chief! there are whose hopes are built
801,18,  upon the ruins of thy glorious name;
802,18,"  who, through the portal of one moment's guilt,"
803,18,  pursue thee with their deadly aim!
804,18,  o matchless perfidy! portentous lust
805,18,"  of monstrous crime!--that horror-striking blade,"
806,18,"  drawn in defiance of the gods, hath laid"
807,18,  the noble syracusan low in dust!
808,18,  shudder'd the walls--the marble city wept--
809,18,  and sylvan places heaved a pensive sigh;
810,18,"  but in calm peace the appointed victim slept,"
811,18,  as he had fallen in magnanimity;
812,18,  of spirit too capacious to require
813,18,  that destiny her course should change; too just
814,18,  to his own native greatness to desire
815,18,"  that wretched boon, days lengthened by mistrust,"
816,18,"  so were the hopeless troubles, that involved"
817,18,"  the soul of dion, instantly dissolved,"
818,18,"  released from life and cares of princely state,"
819,18,  he left this moral grafted on his fate;
820,18,"  him only pleasure leads, and peace attends,"
821,18,"  him, only him, the shield of jove defends,"
822,18,"  whose means are fair and spotless as his ends,"
823,19,", i was thy neighbour once, thou rugged pile!"
824,19,"   four summer weeks i dwelt in sight of thee,"
825,19,   i saw thee every day; and all the while
826,19,"   thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea,"
827,19,"   so pure the sky, so quiet was the air!"
828,19,"   so like, so very like, was day to day!"
829,19,"   whene'er i looked, thy image still was there;"
830,19,"   it trembled, but it never passed away,"
831,19,   how perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep;
832,19,"  no mood, which season takes away, or brings,"
833,19,  i could have fancied that the mighty deep
834,19,"  was even the gentlest of all gentle things,"
835,19,
836,19,"  ah!  then , if mine had been the painter's hand,"
837,19,"  to express what then i saw; and add the gleam,"
838,19,"  the light that never was, on sea or land,"
839,19,"  the consecration, and the poet's dream;"
840,19,
841,19,"  i would have planted thee, thou hoary pile"
842,19,  amid a world how different from this!
843,19,  beside a sea that could not cease to smile;
844,19,"  on tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss,"
845,19,
846,19,  thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine
847,19,  of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;--
848,19,  of all the sunbeams that did ever shine
849,19,"  the very sweetest had to thee been given,"
850,19,
851,19,"  a picture had it been of lasting ease,"
852,19,"  elysian quiet, without toil or strife;"
853,19,"  no motion but the moving tide, a breeze,"
854,19,"  or merely silent nature's breathing life,"
855,19,
856,19,"  such, in the fond illusion of my heart,"
857,19,"  such picture would i at that time have made,"
858,19,"  and seen the soul of truth in every part,"
859,19,"  a steadfast peace that might not be betrayed,"
860,19,
861,19,"  so once it would have been,--'tis so no more;"
862,19,"  i have submitted to a new control,"
863,19,"  a power is gone, which nothing can restore;"
864,19,"  a deep distress hath humanised my soul,"
865,19,
866,19,  not for a moment could i now behold
867,19,"  a smiling sea, and be what i have been,"
868,19,  the feeling of my loss will ne'er be old;
869,19,"  this, which i know, i speak with mind serene,"
870,19,
871,19,"  then, beaumont, friend! who would have been the friend,"
872,19,"  if he had lived, of him whom i deplore,"
873,19,"  this work of thine i blame not, but commend;"
874,19,"  this sea in anger, and that dismal shore,"
875,19,
876,19,"  o 'tis a passionate work!--yet wise and well,"
877,19,  well chosen is the spirit that is here;
878,19,"  that hulk which labours in the deadly swell,"
879,19,"  this rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!"
880,19,
881,19,"  and this huge castle, standing here sublime,"
882,19,"  i love to see the look with which it braves,"
883,19,"  cased in the unfeeling armour of old time,"
884,19,"  the lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling waves,"
885,19,
886,19,"  farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,"
887,19,"  housed in a dream, at distance from the kind!"
888,19,"  such happiness, wherever it be known,"
889,19,"  is to be pitied; for 'tis surely blind,"
890,19,
891,19,"  but welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,"
892,19,  and frequent sights of what is to be borne!
893,19,"  such sights, or worse, as are before me here,--"
894,19,"   not without hope we suffer and we mourn,"
895,20,"why, william, on that old gray stone,"
896,20,"thus for the length of half a day,"
897,20,"why, william, sit you thus alone,"
898,20,and dream your time away?
899,20,
900,20,where are your books? -- that light bequeathed
901,20,to beings else forlorn and blind!
902,20,up! up! and drink the spirit breathed
903,20,"from dead men to their kind,"
904,20,
905,20,"you look round on your mother earth,"
906,20,as if she for no purpose bore you;
907,20,"as if you were her first-born birth,"
908,20,and none had lived before you!
909,20,
910,20,"one morning thus, by esthwaite lake,"
911,20,"when life was sweet, i knew not why,"
912,20,"to me my good friend matthew spake,"
913,20,"and thus i made reply,--"
914,20,
915,20,the eye -- it cannot choose but see;
916,20,we cannot bid the ear be still;
917,20,"our bodies feel, where'er they be,"
918,20,"against or with our will,"
919,20,
920,20,nor less i deem that there are powers
921,20,which of themselves our minds impress;
922,20,that we can feed this mind of ours
923,20,"in a wise passiveness,"
924,20,
925,20,"think you, 'mid all this mighty sum"
926,20,"of things forever speaking,"
927,20,that nothing of itself will come
928,20,but we must still be seeking?
929,20,
930,20,"then ask not wherefore, here, alone,"
931,20,"conversing as i may,"
932,20,"i sit upon this old gray stone,"
933,20,"and dream my time away,"
934,21,",  when first, descending from the moorlands,"
935,21,   i saw the stream of yarrow glide
936,21,"   along a bare and open valley,"
937,21,"   the ettrick shepherd was my guide,"
938,21,"   when last along its banks i wandered,"
939,21,   through groves that had begun to shed
940,21,"   their golden leaves upon the pathways,"
941,21,"   my steps the border-minstrel led,"
942,21,"   the mighty minstrel breathes no longer,"
943,21,  'mid mouldering ruins low he lies;
944,21,"  and death upon the braes of yarrow,"
945,21,"  has closed the shepherd-poet's eyes,"
946,21,
947,21,"  nor has the rolling year twice measured,"
948,21,"  from sign to sign, its stedfast course,"
949,21,  since every mortal power of coleridge
950,21,  was frozen at its marvellous source;
951,21,
952,21,"  the rapt one, of the godlike forehead,"
953,21,"  the heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth,"
954,21,"  and lamb, the frolic and the gentle,"
955,21,"  has vanished from his lonely hearth,"
956,21,
957,21,"  like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,"
958,21,"  or waves that own no curbing hand,"
959,21,"  how fast has brother followed brother,"
960,21,  from sunshine to the sunless land!
961,21,
962,21,"  yet i, whose lids from infant slumber"
963,21,"  were earlier raised, remain to hear"
964,21,"  a timid voice, that asks in whispers,"
965,21,  who next will drop and disappear?
966,21,
967,21,"  our haughty life is crowned with darkness,"
968,21,"  like london with its own black wreath,"
969,21,"  on which with thee, o crabbe! forth-looking,"
970,21,"  i gazed from hampstead's breezy heath,"
971,21,
972,21,"  as if but yesterday departed,"
973,21,"  thou too art gone before; but why,"
974,21,"  o'er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered,"
975,21,  should frail survivors heave a sigh?
976,21,
977,21,"  mourn rather for that holy spirit,"
978,21,"  sweet as the spring, as ocean deep;"
979,21,"  for her who, ere her summer faded,"
980,21,"  has sunk into a breathless sleep,"
981,21,
982,21,"  no more of old romantic sorrows,"
983,21,  for slaughtered youth or love-lorn maid!
984,21,"  with sharper grief is yarrow smitten,"
985,21,"  and ettrick mourns with her their poet dead,"
986,22,that is work of waste and ruin--
987,22,do as charles and i are doing!
988,22,"strawberry-blossoms, one and all,"
989,22,"we must spare them--here are many,"
990,22,"look at it--the flower is small,"
991,22,"small and low, though fair as any,"
992,22,do not touch it! summers two
993,22,"i am older, anne, than you,"
994,22,
995,22,"pull the primrose, sister anne!"
996,22,"pull as many as you can,"
997,22,"--here are daisies, take your fill;"
998,22,"pansies, and the cuckoo-flower,"
999,22,of the lofty daffodil
1000,22,"make your bed, or make your bower;"
1001,22,"fill your lap, and fill your bosom;"
1002,22,only spare the strawberry-blossom!
1003,22,
1004,22,"primroses, the spring may love them--"
1005,22,"summer knows but little of them,"
1006,22,"violets, a barren kind,"
1007,22,withered on the ground must lie;
1008,22,daisies leave no fruit behind
1009,22,when the pretty flowerets die;
1010,22,"pluck them, and another year"
1011,22,"as many will be blowing here,"
1012,22,
1013,22,god has given a kindlier power
1014,22,"to the favoured strawberry-flower,"
1015,22,hither soon as spring is fled
1016,22,you and charles and i will walk;
1017,22,"lurking berries, ripe and red,"
1018,22,"then will hang on every stalk,"
1019,22,each within its leafy bower;
1020,22,and for that promise spare the flower!
1021,23,i know an aged man constrained to dwell
1022,23,"in a large house of public charity,"
1023,23,"where he abides, as in a prisoner's cell,"
1024,23,"with numbers near, alas! no company,"
1025,23,
1026,23,"when he could creep about, at will, though poor"
1027,23,"and forced to live on alms, this old man fed"
1028,23,"a redbreast, one that to his cottage door"
1029,23,"came not, but in a lane partook his bread,"
1030,23,
1031,23,"there, at the root of one particular tree,"
1032,23,an easy seat this worn-out labourer found
1033,23,while robin pecked the crumbs upon his knee
1034,23,"laid one by one, or scattered on the ground,"
1035,23,
1036,23,"dear intercourse was theirs, day after day;"
1037,23,what signs of mutual gladness when they met!
1038,23,"think of their common peace, their simple play,"
1039,23,"the parting moment and its fond regret,"
1040,23,
1041,23,"months passed in love that failed not to fulfil,"
1042,23,"in spite of season's change, its own demand,"
1043,23,by fluttering pinions here and busy bill;
1044,23,"there by caresses from a tremulous hand,"
1045,23,
1046,23,thus in the chosen spot a tie so strong
1047,23,"was formed between the solitary pair,"
1048,23,that when his fate had housed him 'mid a throng
1049,23,"the captive shunned all converse proffered there,"
1050,23,
1051,23,"wife, children, kindred, they were dead and gone;"
1052,23,"but, if no evil hap his wishes crossed,"
1053,23,"one living stay was left, and on that one"
1054,23,"some recompence for all that he had lost,"
1055,23,
1056,23,"oh that the good old man had power to prove,"
1057,23,"by message sent through air or visible token,"
1058,23,"that still he loves the bird, and still must love;"
1059,23,that friendship lasts though fellowship is broken!
1060,24,in calling forth and strengthening the imagination
1061,24,in boyhood and early youth
1062,24,
1063,24,wisdom and spirit of the universe!
1064,24,"thou soul, that art the eternity of thought!"
1065,24,and giv'st to forms and images a breath
1066,24,"and everlasting motion! not in vain,"
1067,24,"by day or star-light, thus from my first dawn"
1068,24,of childhood didst thou intertwine for me
1069,24,"the passions that build up our human soul,"
1070,24,"not with the mean and vulgar works of man,"
1071,24,"but with high objects, with enduring things,"
1072,24,with life and nature; purifying thus
1073,24,"the elements of feeling and of thought,"
1074,24,and sanctifying by such discipline
1075,24,"both pain and fear, -until we recognize"
1076,24,"a grandeur in the beatings of the heart,"
1077,24,nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me
1078,24,"with stinted kindness, in november days,"
1079,24,when vapours rolling down the valleys made
1080,24,a lonely scene more lonesome; among woods
1081,24,"at noon; and mid the calm of summer nights,"
1082,24,"when, by the margin of the trembling lake,"
1083,24,"beneath the gloomy hills, i homeward went"
1084,24,"in solitude, such intercourse was mine,"
1085,24,"'twas mine among the fields both day and night,"
1086,24,"and by the waters, all the summer long,"
1087,24,"and in the frosty season, when the sun"
1088,24,"was set, and, visible for many a mile,"
1089,24,"the cottage windows through the twilight blazed,"
1090,24,"i heeded not the summons, -happy time"
1091,24,it was indeed for all of us; for me
1092,24,it was a time of rapture! -clear and loud
1093,24,"the village clock tolled six -i wheeled about,"
1094,24,proud and exulting like an untired horse
1095,24,"that cares not for his home, -all shod with steel"
1096,24,"we hissed along the polished ice, in games"
1097,24,"confederate, imitative of the chase"
1098,24,"and woodland pleasures, -the resounding horn,"
1099,24,"the pack loud-bellowing, and the hunted hare,"
1100,24,"so through the darkness and the cold we flew,"
1101,24,"and not a voice was idle, with the din"
1102,24,meanwhile the precipices rang aloud;
1103,24,the leafless trees and every icy crag
1104,24,tinkled like iron; while the distant hills
1105,24,into the tumult sent an alien sound
1106,24,"of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,"
1107,24,"eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west"
1108,24,"the orange sky of evening died away,"
1109,24,
1110,24,not seldom from the uproar i retired
1111,24,"into a silent bay, -or sportively"
1112,24,"glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,"
1113,24,to cut across the reflex of a star;
1114,24,"image that, flying still before me, gleamed"
1115,24,"upon the glassy plain, and oftentimes,"
1116,24,"when we had given our bodies to the wind,"
1117,24,and all the shadowy banks on either side
1118,24,"came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still"
1119,24,"the rapid line of motion, then at once"
1120,24,"have i, reclining back upon my heels,"
1121,24,stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs
1122,24,wheeled by me -even as if the earth had rolled
1123,24,with visible motion her diurnal round!
1124,24,"behind me did they stretch in solemn train,"
1125,24,"feebler and feebler, and i stood and watched"
1126,24,"till all was tranquil as a summer sea,"
1127,25,stranger! this hillock of mis-shapen stones
1128,25,"is not a ruin spared or made by time,"
1129,25,"nor, as perchance thou rashly deem'st, the cairn"
1130,25,"of some old british chief, 'tis nothing more"
1131,25,than the rude embryo of a little dome
1132,25,"or pleasure-house, once destined to be built"
1133,25,"among the birch-trees of this rocky isle,"
1134,25,"but, as it chanced, sir william having learned"
1135,25,"that from the shore a full-grown man might wade,"
1136,25,and make himself a freeman of this spot
1137,25,"at any hour he chose, the prudent knight"
1138,25,"desisted, and the quarry and the mound"
1139,25,"are monuments of his unfinished task,"
1140,25,"the block on which these lines are traced, perhaps,"
1141,25,was once selected as the corner-stone
1142,25,"of that intended pile, which would have been"
1143,25,"some quaint odd plaything of elaborate skill,"
1144,25,"so that, i guess, the linnet and the thrush,"
1145,25,"and other little builders who dwell here,"
1146,25,"had wondered at the work, but blame him not,"
1147,25,"for old sir william was a gentle knight,"
1148,25,"bled in this vale, to which he appertained"
1149,25,"with all his ancestry, then peace to him,"
1150,25,and for the outrage which he had devised
1151,25,entire forgiveness!--but if thou art one
1152,25,on fire with thy impatience to become
1153,25,"an inmate of these mountains,--if, disturbed"
1154,25,"by beautiful conceptions, thou hast hewn"
1155,25,out of the quiet rock the elements
1156,25,of thy trim mansion destined soon to blaze
1157,25,"in snow-white splendour,--think again; and, taught"
1158,25,"by old sir william and his quarry, leave"
1159,25,thy fragments to the bramble and the rose;
1160,25,"there let the vernal slow-worm sun himself,"
1161,25,"and let the redbreast hop from stone to stone,"
1162,26,",   tax not the royal saint with vain expense,"
1163,26,   with ill-matched aims the architect who planned--
1164,26,   albeit labouring for a scanty band
1165,26,   of white-robed scholars only--this immense
1166,26,   and glorious work of fine intelligence!
1167,26,   give all thou canst; high heaven rejects the lore
1168,26,   of nicely-calculated less or more;
1169,26,   so deemed the man who fashioned for the sense
1170,26,"   these lofty pillars, spread that branching roof"
1171,26,"  self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,"
1172,26,"  where light and shade repose, where music dwells"
1173,26,  lingering--and wandering on as loth to die;
1174,26,  like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
1175,26,"  that they were born for immortality,"
1176,27,"it is a beauteous evening, calm and free,"
1177,27,the holy time is quiet as a nun
1178,27,breathless with adoration; the broad sun
1179,27,is sinking down in its tranquility;
1180,27,"the gentleness of heaven broods o'er the sea,"
1181,27,"listen! the mighty being is awake,"
1182,27,and doth with his eternal motion make
1183,27,"a sound like thunder - everlastingly,"
1184,27,"dear child! dear girl! that walkest with me here,"
1185,27,"if thou appear untouched by solemn thought,"
1186,27,"thy nature is not therefore less divine,"
1187,27,"thou liest in abraham's bosom all the year,"
1188,27,"and worship'st at the temple's inner shrine,"
1189,27,"god being with thee when we know it not,"
1190,28,",   it is not to be thought of that the flood"
1191,28,"   of british freedom, which, to the open sea"
1192,28,"   of the world's praise, from dark antiquity"
1193,28,"   hath flowed, with pomp of waters, unwithstood,"
1194,28,   roused though it be full often to a mood
1195,28,"   which spurns the check of salutary bands,"
1196,28,   that this most famous stream in bogs and sands
1197,28,   should perish; and to evil and to good
1198,28,"   be lost for ever, in our halls is hung"
1199,28,"  armoury of the invincible knights of old,"
1200,28,"  we must be free or die, who speak the tongue"
1201,28,  that shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold
1202,28,"  which milton held,--in every thing we are sprung"
1203,28,"  of earth's first blood, have titles manifold,"
1204,29,"it was an april morning, fresh and clear"
1205,29,"the rivulet, delighting in its strength,"
1206,29,ran with a young man's speed; and yet the voice
1207,29,of waters which the winter had supplied
1208,29,"was softened down into a vernal tone,"
1209,29,"the spirit of enjoyment and desire,"
1210,29,"and hopes and wishes, from all living things"
1211,29,"went circling, like a multitude of sounds,"
1212,29,the budding groves seemed eager to urge on
1213,29,the steps of june; as if their various hues
1214,29,were only hindrances that stood between
1215,29,"them and their object, but, meanwhile, prevailed"
1216,29,such an entire contentment in the air
1217,29,"that every naked ash, and tardy tree"
1218,29,"yet leafless, showed as if the countenance"
1219,29,with which it looked on this delightful day
1220,29,"were native to the summer,--up the brook"
1221,29,"i roamed in the confusion of my heart,"
1222,29,"alive to all things and forgetting all,"
1223,29,at length i to a sudden turning came
1224,29,"in this continuous glen, where down a rock"
1225,29,"the stream, so ardent in its course before,"
1226,29,"sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all"
1227,29,"which i till then had heard, appeared the voice"
1228,29,"of common pleasure, beast and bird, the lamb,"
1229,29,"the shepherd's dog, the linnet and the thrush"
1230,29,"vied with this waterfall, and made a song,"
1231,29,"which, while i listened, seemed like the wild growth"
1232,29,"or like some natural produce of the air,"
1233,29,"that could not cease to be, green leaves were here;"
1234,29,"but 'twas the foliage of the rocks--the birch,"
1235,29,"the yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn,"
1236,29,"with hanging islands of resplendent furze,"
1237,29,"and, on a summit, distant a short space,"
1238,29,"by any who should look beyond the dell,"
1239,29,"a single mountain-cottage might be seen,"
1240,29,"i gazed and gazed, and to myself i said,"
1241,29,"our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook,"
1242,29,"my emma, i will dedicate to thee,"
1243,29,"----soon did the spot become my other home,"
1244,29,"my dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode,"
1245,29,"and, of the shepherds who have seen me there,"
1246,29,to whom i sometimes in our idle talk
1247,29,"have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps,"
1248,29,"years after we are gone and in our graves,"
1249,29,"when they have cause to speak of this wild place,"
1250,29,"may call it by the name of emma's dell,"
1251,30,smile of the moon!---for i so name
1252,30,that silent greeting from above;
1253,30,a gentle flash of light that came
1254,30,from her whom drooping captives love;
1255,30,or art thou of still higher birth?
1256,30,"thou that didst part the clouds of earth,"
1257,30,my torpor to reprove!
1258,30,
1259,30,"bright boon of pitying heaven!---alas,"
1260,30,i may not trust thy placid cheer!
1261,30,pondering that time tonight will pass
1262,30,the threshold of another year;
1263,30,for years to me are sad and dull;
1264,30,my very moments are too full
1265,30,"of hopelessness and fear,"
1266,30,
1267,30,"and yet, the soul-awakening gleam,"
1268,30,that struck perchance the farthest cone
1269,30,"of scotland's rocky wilds, did seem"
1270,30,"to visit me, and me alone;"
1271,30,"me, unapproached by any friend,"
1272,30,save those who to my sorrow lend
1273,30,"tears due unto their own,"
1274,30,
1275,30,to night the church-tower bells will ring
1276,30,through these wide realms a festire peal;
1277,30,to the new year a welcoming;
1278,30,a tuneful offering for the weal
1279,30,of happy millions lulled in deep;
1280,30,"while i am forced to watch and weep,"
1281,30,"by wounds that may not heal,"
1282,30,
1283,30,"born all too high, by wedlock raised"
1284,30,still higherñto be cast thus low!
1285,30,would that mine eyes had never gazed
1286,30,on aught of more ambitious show
1287,30,than the sweet flowerets of the fields
1288,30,---it is my royal state that yields
1289,30,"this bitterness of woe,"
1290,30,
1291,30,"yet how?---for i, if there be truth"
1292,30,"in the world's voice, was passing fair;"
1293,30,"and beauty, for confiding youth,"
1294,30,those shocks of passion can prepare
1295,30,that kill the bloom before its time;
1296,30,"and blanch, without the owner's crime,"
1297,30,"the most resplendent hair,"
1298,30,
1299,30,unblest distinction! showered on me
1300,30,"to bind a lingering life in chains,"
1301,30,"all that could quit my grasp, or flee,"
1302,30,is gone;---but not the subtle stains
1303,30,fixed in the spirit; for even here
1304,30,can i be proud that jealous fear
1305,30,"of what i was remains,"
1306,30,
1307,30,a woman rules my prison's key;
1308,30,"a sister queen, against the bent"
1309,30,"o£ law and holiest sympathy,"
1310,30,"detains me, doubtful of the event;"
1311,30,"great god, who feel'st for my distress,"
1312,30,"my thoughts are all that i possess,"
1313,30,o keep them innocent!
1314,30,
1315,30,"farewell desire of human aid,"
1316,30,which abject mortals vainly court!
1317,30,"by friends deceived, by foes betrayed,"
1318,30,"of fears the prey, of hopes the sport;"
1319,30,nought but the world-redeeming cross
1320,30,"is able to support my loss,"
1321,30,"my burthen to support,"
1322,30,
1323,30,hark! the death-note of the year
1324,30,sounded by the castle-clock!
1325,30,from her sunk eyes a stagnant tear
1326,30,"stole forth, unsettled by the shock;"
1327,30,"but oft the woods renewed their green,"
1328,30,ere the tired head of scotland's queen
1329,30,reposed upon the block!
1330,31,",  with sacrifice before the rising morn"
1331,31,   vows have i made by fruitless hope inspired;
1332,31,"   and from the infernal gods, 'mid shades forlorn"
1333,31,"   of night, my slaughtered lord have i required,"
1334,31,   celestial pity i again implore;--
1335,31,"   restore him to my sight--great jove, restore!"
1336,31,"   so speaking, and by fervent love endowed"
1337,31,"   with faith, the suppliant heavenward lifts her hands;"
1338,31,"   while, like the sun emerging from a cloud,"
1339,31,  her countenance brightens--and her eye expands;
1340,31,"  her bosom heaves and spreads, her stature grows;"
1341,31,"  as she expects the issue in repose,"
1342,31,
1343,31,  o terror! what hath she perceived?--o joy!
1344,31,  what doth she look on?--whom doth she behold?
1345,31,  her hero slain upon the beach of troy?
1346,31,  his vital presence? his corporeal mould?
1347,31,  it is--if sense deceive her not--'tis he!
1348,31,"  and a god leads him, wingèd mercury!"
1349,31,
1350,31,  mild hermes spake--and touched her with his wand
1351,31,"  that calms all fear; such grace hath crowned thy prayer,"
1352,31,  laodamía! that at jove's command
1353,31,"  thy husband walks the paths of upper air,"
1354,31,  he comes to tarry with thee three hours' space;
1355,31,"  accept the gift, behold him face to face!"
1356,31,
1357,31,  forth sprang the impassioned queen her lord to clasp;
1358,31,  again that consummation she essayed;
1359,31,  but unsubstantial form eludes her grasp
1360,31,"  as often as that eager grasp was made,"
1361,31,"  the phantom parts--but parts to re-unite,"
1362,31,"  and re-assume his place before her sight,"
1363,31,
1364,31,"  protesiláus, lo! thy guide is gone!"
1365,31,"  confirm, i pray, the vision with thy voice,"
1366,31,"  this is our palace,--yonder is thy throne;"
1367,31,"  speak, and the floor thou tread'st on will rejoice,"
1368,31,  not to appal me have the gods bestowed
1369,31,"  this precious boon; and blest a sad abode,"
1370,31,
1371,31,"  great jove, laodamía! doth not leave"
1372,31,"  his gifts imperfect,--spectre though i be,"
1373,31,  i am not sent to scare thee or deceive;
1374,31,"  but in reward of thy fidelity,"
1375,31,  and something also did my worth obtain;
1376,31,"  for fearless virtue bringeth boundless gain,"
1377,31,
1378,31,"  thou knowest, the delphic oracle foretold"
1379,31,  that the first greek who touched the trojan strand
1380,31,"  should die; but me the threat could not withhold,"
1381,31,  a generous cause a victim did demand;
1382,31,  and forth i leapt upon the sandy plain;
1383,31,"  a self-devoted chief--by hector slain,"
1384,31,
1385,31,"  supreme of heroes--bravest, noblest, best!"
1386,31,"  thy matchless courage i bewail no more,"
1387,31,"  which then, when tens of thousands were deprest"
1388,31,"  by doubt, propelled thee to the fatal shore;"
1389,31,  thou found'st--and i forgive thee--here thou art--
1390,31,"  a nobler counsellor than my poor heart,"
1391,31,
1392,31,"  but thou, though capable of sternest deed,"
1393,31,"  wert kind as resolute, and good as brave;"
1394,31,"  and he, whose power restores thee, hath decreed"
1395,31,"  thou should'st elude the malice of the grave,"
1396,31,"  redundant are thy locks, thy lips as fair"
1397,31,"   as when their breath enriched thessalian air,"
1398,31,
1399,31,"  no spectre greets me,--no vain shadow this;"
1400,31,"  come, blooming hero, place thee by my side!"
1401,31,"  give, on this well-known couch, one nuptial kiss"
1402,31,"  to me, this day a second time thy bride!"
1403,31,"  jove frowned in heaven, the conscious parcæ threw"
1404,31,"  upon those roseate lips a stygian hue,"
1405,31,
1406,31,"  this visage tells thee that my doom is past,"
1407,31,"  nor should the change be mourned, even if the joys"
1408,31,  of sense were able to return as fast
1409,31,"  and surely as they vanish, earth destroys"
1410,31,"  those raptures duly---erebus disdains,"
1411,31,"  calm pleasures there abide--majestic pains,"
1412,31,
1413,31,"  be taught, o faithful consort, to control"
1414,31,"  rebellious passion, for the gods approve"
1415,31,"  the depth, and not the tumult, of the soul;"
1416,31,"  a fervent, not ungovernable love,"
1417,31,  thy transports moderate; and meekly mourn
1418,31,"  when i depart, for brief is my sojourn--"
1419,31,
1420,31,  ah wherefore?--did not hercules by force
1421,31,  wrest from the guardian monster of the tomb
1422,31,"  alcestis, a reanimated corse,"
1423,31,  given back to dwell on earth in vernal bloom?
1424,31,"  medea's spells dispersed the weight of years,"
1425,31,"  and æson stood a youth 'mid youthful peers,"
1426,31,
1427,31,  the gods to us are merciful--and they
1428,31,"  yet further may relent, for mightier far"
1429,31,"  than strength of nerve and sinew, or the sway"
1430,31,"  of magic potent over sun and star,"
1431,31,"  is love, though oft to agony distrest,"
1432,31,"  and though his favourite seat be feeble woman's breast,"
1433,31,
1434,31,"  but if thou goest, i follow-- peace! he said,--"
1435,31,  she looked upon him and was calmed and cheered;
1436,31,  the ghastly colour from his lips had fled;
1437,31,"  in his deportment, shape, and mien, appeared"
1438,31,"  elysian beauty, melancholy grace,"
1439,31,"  brought from a pensive though a happy place,"
1440,31,
1441,31,"  he spake of love, such love as spirits feel"
1442,31,  in worlds whose course is equable and pure;
1443,31,  no fears to beat away--no strife to heal--
1444,31," the past unsighed for, and the future sure;"
1445,31, spake of heroic arts in graver mood
1446,31," revived, with finer harmony pursued;"
1447,31,
1448,31, of all that is most beauteous--imaged there
1449,31," in happier beauty; more pellucid streams,"
1450,31," an ampler ether, a diviner air,"
1451,31, and fields invested with purpureal gleams;
1452,31," climes which the sun, who sheds the brightest day"
1453,31," earth knows, is all unworthy to survey,"
1454,31,
1455,31, yet there the soul shall enter which hath earned
1456,31," that privilege by virtue,--ill, said he,"
1457,31," the end of man's existence i discerned,"
1458,31, who from ignoble games and revelry
1459,31," could draw, when we had parted, vain delight,"
1460,31," while tears were thy best pastime, day and night;"
1461,31,
1462,31, and while my youthful peers before my eyes
1463,31, each hero following his peculiar bent
1464,31, prepared themselves for glorious enterprise
1465,31," by martial sports,--or, seated in the tent,"
1466,31, chieftains and kings in council were detained;
1467,31," what time the fleet at aulis lay enchained,"
1468,31,
1469,31," the wished-for wind was given,--i then revolved"
1470,31," the oracle, upon the silent sea;"
1471,31," and, if no worthier led the way, resolved"
1472,31," that, of a thousand vessels, mine should be"
1473,31," the foremost prow in pressing to the strand,--"
1474,31," mine the first blood that tinged the trojan sand,"
1475,31,
1476,31," yet bitter, oft-times bitter, was the pang"
1477,31," when of thy loss i thought, belovèd wife!"
1478,31," on thee too fondly did my memory hang,"
1479,31," and on the joys we shared in mortal life,--"
1480,31," the paths which we had trod--these fountains, flowers,"
1481,31," my new-planned cities, and unfinished towers,"
1482,31,
1483,31," but should suspense permit the foe to cry,"
1484,31," 'behold they tremble!--haughty their array,"
1485,31, yet of their numbers no one dares to die?'
1486,31," in soul i swept the indignity away,"
1487,31," old frailties then recurred,--but lofty thought,"
1488,31," in act embodied, my deliverance wrought,"
1489,31,
1490,31," and thou, though strong in love, art all too weak"
1491,31," in reason, in self-government too slow;"
1492,31, i counsel thee by fortitude to seek
1493,31," our blest re-union in the shades below,"
1494,31, the invisible world with thee hath sympathised;
1495,31," be thy affections raised and solemnised,"
1496,31,
1497,31," learn, by a mortal yearning, to ascend--"
1498,31," seeking a higher object, love was given,"
1499,31," encouraged, sanctioned, chiefly for that end;"
1500,31, for this the passion to excess was driven--
1501,31," that self might be annulled, her bondage prove"
1502,31," the fetters of a dream opposed to love,--"
1503,31,
1504,31, aloud she shrieked! for hermes re-appears!
1505,31," round the dear shade she would have clung--'tis vain,"
1506,31, the hours are past--too brief had they been years;
1507,31," and him no mortal effort can detain,"
1508,31," swift, toward the realms that know not earthly day,"
1509,31," he through the portal takes his silent way,"
1510,31," and on the palace-floor a lifeless corse she lay,"
1511,31,
1512,31," thus, all in vain exhorted and reproved,"
1513,31," she perished; and, as for a wilful crime,"
1514,31," by the just gods whom no weak pity moved,"
1515,31," was doomed to wear out her appointed time,"
1516,31," apart from happy ghosts, that gather flowers"
1517,31," of blissful quiet 'mid unfading bowers,"
1518,31,
1519,31, --yet tears to human suffering are due;
1520,31, and mortal hopes defeated and o'erthrown
1521,31," are mourned by man, and not by man alone,"
1522,31," as fondly he believes,--upon the side"
1523,31, of hellespont such faith was entertained
1524,31, a knot of spiry trees for ages grew
1525,31, from out the tomb of him for whom she died;
1526,31," and ever, when such stature they had gained"
1527,31," that ilium's walls were subject to their view,"
1528,31, the trees' tall summits withered at the sight;
1529,31, a constant interchange of growth and blight!
1530,32,"five years have past; five summers, with the length"
1531,32,of five long winters! and again i hear
1532,32,"these waters, rolling from their mountain-springs"
1533,32,"with a soft inland murmur,--once again"
1534,32,"do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs,"
1535,32,that on a wild secluded scene impress
1536,32,thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect
1537,32,"the landscape with the quiet of the sky,"
1538,32,the day is come when i again repose
1539,32,"here, under this dark sycamore, and view"
1540,32,"these plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,"
1541,32,"which at this season, with their unripe fruits,"
1542,32,"are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves"
1543,32,"'mid groves and copses, once again i see"
1544,32,"these hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines"
1545,32,"of sportive wood run wild, these pastoral farms,"
1546,32,green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
1547,32,"sent up, in silence, from among the trees!"
1548,32,"with some uncertain notice, as might seem"
1549,32,"of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,"
1550,32,"or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire"
1551,32,"the hermit sits alone, these beauteous forms,"
1552,32,"through a long absence, have not been to me"
1553,32,"as is a landscape to a blind man's eye,"
1554,32,"but oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din"
1555,32,"of towns and cities, i have owed to them"
1556,32,"in hours of weariness, sensations sweet,"
1557,32,"felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;"
1558,32,"and passing even into my purer mind,"
1559,32,"with tranquil restoration,--feelings too"
1560,32,"of unremembered pleasure, such, perhaps,"
1561,32,as have no slight or trivial influence
1562,32,"on that best portion of a good man's life,"
1563,32,"his little, nameless, unremembered, acts"
1564,32,"of kindness and of love, nor less, i trust,"
1565,32,"to them i may have owed another gift,"
1566,32,"of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,"
1567,32,"in which the burthen of the mystery,"
1568,32,in which the heavy and the weary weight
1569,32,"of all this unintelligible world,"
1570,32,"is lightened,--that serene and blessed mood,"
1571,32,"in which the affections gently lead us on,--"
1572,32,"until, the breath of this corporeal frame"
1573,32,and even the motion of our human blood
1574,32,"almost suspended, we are laid asleep"
1575,32,"in body, and become a living soul,"
1576,32,while with an eye made quiet by the power
1577,32,"of harmony, and the deep power of joy,"
1578,32,"we see into the life of things, if this"
1579,32,"be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft--"
1580,32,in darkness and amid the many shapes
1581,32,of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir
1582,32,"unprofitable, and the fever of the world,"
1583,32,have hung upon the beatings of my heart--
1584,32,"how oft, in spirit, have i turned to thee,"
1585,32,"o sylvan wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,"
1586,32,how often has my spirit turned to thee!
1587,32,"and now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,"
1588,32,"with many recognitions dim and faint,"
1589,32,"and somewhat of a sad perplexity,"
1590,32,"the picture of the mind revives again,"
1591,32,"while here i stand, not only with the sense"
1592,32,"of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts"
1593,32,that in this moment there is life and food
1594,32,"for future years, and so i dare to hope,"
1595,32,"though changed, no doubt, from what i was when first"
1596,32,i came among these hills; when like a roe
1597,32,"i bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides"
1598,32,"of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,"
1599,32,"wherever nature led, more like a man"
1600,32,"flying from something that he dreads, than one"
1601,32,"who sought the thing he loved, for nature then"
1602,32,"the coarser pleasures of my boyish days,"
1603,32,and their glad animal movements all gone by
1604,32,"to me was all in all,--i cannot paint"
1605,32,"what then i was, the sounding cataract"
1606,32,"haunted me like a passion, the tall rock,"
1607,32,"the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,"
1608,32,"their colours and their forms, were then to me"
1609,32,"an appetite; a feeling and a love,"
1610,32,"that had no need of a remoter charm,"
1611,32,"by thought supplied, nor any interest"
1612,32,"unborrowed from the eye,--that time is past,"
1613,32,"and all its aching joys are now no more,"
1614,32,"and all its dizzy raptures, not for this"
1615,32,"faint i, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts"
1616,32,"have followed; for such loss, i would believe,"
1617,32,"abundant recompence, for i have learned"
1618,32,"to look on nature, not as in the hour"
1619,32,of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
1620,32,"the still, sad music of humanity,"
1621,32,"nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power"
1622,32,"to chasten and subdue, and i have felt"
1623,32,a presence that disturbs me with the joy
1624,32,of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
1625,32,"of something far more deeply interfused,"
1626,32,"whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,"
1627,32,"and the round ocean and the living air,"
1628,32,"and the blue sky, and in the mind of man;"
1629,32,"a motion and a spirit, that impels"
1630,32,"all thinking things, all objects of all thought,"
1631,32,"and rolls through all things, therefore am i still"
1632,32,"a lover of the meadows and the woods,"
1633,32,and mountains; and of all that we behold
1634,32,from this green earth; of all the mighty world
1635,32,"of eye, and ear,--both what they half create,"
1636,32,and what perceive; well pleased to recognise
1637,32,"in nature and the language of the sense,"
1638,32,"the anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,"
1639,32,"the guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul"
1640,32,"of all my moral being, nor perchance,"
1641,32,"if i were not thus taught, should i the more"
1642,32,"suffer my genial spirits to decay,"
1643,32,for thou art with me here upon the banks
1644,32,"of this fair river; thou my dearest friend,"
1645,32,"my dear, dear friend; and in thy voice i catch"
1646,32,"the language of my former heart, and read"
1647,32,my former pleasures in the shooting lights
1648,32,"of thy wild eyes, oh! yet a little while"
1649,32,"may i behold in thee what i was once,"
1650,32,"my dear, dear sister! and this prayer i make,"
1651,32,knowing that nature never did betray
1652,32,"the heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,"
1653,32,"through all the years of this our life, to lead"
1654,32,"from joy to joy, for she can so inform"
1655,32,"the mind that is within us, so impress"
1656,32,"with quietness and beauty, and so feed"
1657,32,"with lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,"
1658,32,"rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,"
1659,32,"nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all"
1660,32,"the dreary intercourse of daily life,"
1661,32,"shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb"
1662,32,"our cheerful faith, that all which we behold"
1663,32,"is full of blessings, therefore let the moon"
1664,32,shine on thee in thy solitary walk;
1665,32,and let the misty mountain-winds be free
1666,32,"to blow against thee, and, in after years,"
1667,32,when these wild ecstasies shall be matured
1668,32,into a sober pleasure; when thy mind
1669,32,"shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,"
1670,32,thy memory be as a dwelling-place
1671,32,"for all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,"
1672,32,"if solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,"
1673,32,"should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts"
1674,32,"of tender joy wilt thou remember me,"
1675,32,"and these my exhortations! nor, perchance--"
1676,32,if i should be where i no more can hear
1677,32,"thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams"
1678,32,of past existence--wilt thou then forget
1679,32,that on the banks of this delightful stream
1680,32,"we stood together; and that i, so long"
1681,32,"a worshipper of nature, hither came"
1682,32,"unwearied in that service, rather say"
1683,32,with warmer love--oh! with far deeper zeal
1684,32,"of holier love, nor wilt thou then forget,"
1685,32,"that after many wanderings, many years"
1686,32,"of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,"
1687,32,"and this green pastoral landscape, were to me"
1688,32,"more dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!"
1689,33,"i heard a thousand blended notes,"
1690,33,"while in a grove i sate reclined,"
1691,33,in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
1692,33,"bring sad thoughts to the mind,"
1693,33,
1694,33,to her fair works did nature link
1695,33,the human soul that through me ran;
1696,33,and much it grieved my heart to think
1697,33,"what man has made of man,"
1698,33,
1699,33,"through primrose tufts, in that green bower,"
1700,33,the periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
1701,33,and 'tis my faith that every flower
1702,33,"enjoys the air it breathes,"
1703,33,
1704,33,"the birds around me hopped and played,"
1705,33,"their thoughts i cannot measure,---"
1706,33,"but the least motion which they made,"
1707,33,"it seemed a thrill of pleasure,"
1708,33,
1709,33,"the budding twigs spread out their fan,"
1710,33,to catch the breezy air;
1711,33,"and i must think, do all i can,"
1712,33,"that there was pleasure there,"
1713,33,
1714,33,"if this belief from heaven be sent,"
1715,33,"if such be nature's holy plan,"
1716,33,have i not reason to lament
1717,33,what man has made of man?
1718,34,"milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour,"
1719,34,"england hath need of thee, she is a fen"
1720,34,"of stagnant waters, altar, sword, and pen,"
1721,34,"fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,"
1722,34,have forfeited their ancient english dower
1723,34,"of inward happiness, we are selfish men;"
1724,34,"oh! raise us up, return to us again;"
1725,34,"and give us manners, virtue, freedom, power,"
1726,34,"thy soul was like a star, and dwelt apart,"
1727,34,"thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea,"
1728,34,"pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,"
1729,34,"so didst thou travel on life's common way,"
1730,34,in cheerful godliness; and yet the heart
1731,34,"the lowliest duties on herself did lay,"
1732,35,"oft i had heard of lucy gray,"
1733,35,"and when i cross'd the wild,"
1734,35,i chanc'd to see at break of day
1735,35,"the solitary child,"
1736,35,
1737,35,"no mate, no comrade lucy knew;"
1738,35,"she dwelt on a wild moor,"
1739,35,the sweetest thing that ever grew
1740,35,beside a human door!
1741,35,
1742,35,"you yet may spy the fawn at play,"
1743,35,the hare upon the green;
1744,35,but the sweet face of lucy gray
1745,35,"will never more be seen,"
1746,35,
1747,35,"to-night will be a stormy night,"
1748,35,"you to the town must go,"
1749,35,"and take a lantern, child, to light"
1750,35,"your mother thro' the snow,"
1751,35,
1752,35,"that, father! will i gladly do;"
1753,35,'tis scarcely afternoon--
1754,35,"the minster-clock has just struck two,"
1755,35,"and yonder is the moon,"
1756,35,
1757,35,at this the father rais'd his hook
1758,35,and snapp'd a faggot-band;
1759,35,"he plied his work, and lucy took"
1760,35,"the lantern in her hand,"
1761,35,
1762,35,"not blither is the mountain roe,"
1763,35,with many a wanton stroke
1764,35,"her feet disperse, the powd'ry snow"
1765,35,"that rises up like smoke,"
1766,35,
1767,35,"the storm came on before its time,"
1768,35,"she wander'd up and down,"
1769,35,and many a hill did lucy climb
1770,35,"but never reach'd the town,"
1771,35,
1772,35,the wretched parents all that night
1773,35,went shouting far and wide;
1774,35,but there was neither sound nor sight
1775,35,"to serve them for a guide,"
1776,35,
1777,35,at day-break on a hill they stood
1778,35,that overlook'd the moor;
1779,35,and thence they saw the bridge of wood
1780,35,"a furlong from their door,"
1781,35,
1782,35,"and now they homeward turn'd, and cry'd"
1783,35,in heaven we all shall meet!
1784,35,when in the snow the mother spied
1785,35,"the print of lucy's feet,"
1786,35,
1787,35,then downward from the steep hill's edge
1788,35,they track'd the footmarks small;
1789,35,"and through the broken hawthorn-hedge,"
1790,35,and by the long stone-wall;
1791,35,
1792,35,"and then an open field they cross'd,"
1793,35,the marks were still the same;
1794,35,"they track'd them on, nor ever lost,"
1795,35,"and to the bridge they came,"
1796,35,
1797,35,they follow'd from the snowy bank
1798,35,"the footmarks, one by one,"
1799,35,"into the middle of the plank,"
1800,35,"and further there were none,"
1801,35,
1802,35,yet some maintain that to this day
1803,35,"she is a living child,"
1804,35,that you may see sweet lucy gray
1805,35,"upon the lonesome wild,"
1806,35,
1807,35,"o'er rough and smooth she trips along,"
1808,35,and never looks behind;
1809,35,and sings a solitary song
1810,35,"that whistles in the wind,"
1811,36,"strange fits of passion have i known,"
1812,36,"and i will dare to tell,"
1813,36,"but in the lover's ear alone,"
1814,36,"what once to me befell,"
1815,36,
1816,36,when she i loved looked every day
1817,36,"fresh as a rose in june,"
1818,36,"i to her cottage bent my way,"
1819,36,"beneath an evening-moon,"
1820,36,
1821,36,"upon the moon i fixed my eye,"
1822,36,all over the wide lea;
1823,36,with quickening pace my horse drew nigh
1824,36,"those paths so dear to me,"
1825,36,
1826,36,and now we reached the orchard-plot;
1827,36,"and, as we climbed the hill,"
1828,36,the sinking moon to lucy's cot
1829,36,"came near, and nearer still,"
1830,36,
1831,36,"in one of those sweet dreams i slept,"
1832,36,kind nature's gentlest boon!
1833,36,and all the while my eye i kept
1834,36,"on the descending moon,"
1835,36,
1836,36,my horse moved on; hoof after hoof
1837,36,"he raised, and never stopped,"
1838,36,"when down behind the cottage roof,"
1839,36,"at once, the bright moon dropped,"
1840,36,
1841,36,what fond and wayward thoughts will slide
1842,36,into a lover's head!
1843,36,"o mercy! to myself i cried,"
1844,36,if lucy should be dead!
1845,37,she dwelt among the untrodden ways
1846,37,"    beside the springs of dove,"
1847,37,maid whom there were none to praise
1848,37,"    and very few to love,"
1849,37,
1850,37,a violet by a mossy stone
1851,37,    half hidden from the eye!
1852,37,"---fair as a star, when only one"
1853,37,"    is shining in the sky,"
1854,37,
1855,37,"she lived unknown, and few could know"
1856,37,    when lucy ceased to be;
1857,37,"but she is in her grave, and, oh,"
1858,37,    the difference to me!
1859,38,a slumber did my spirit seal;
1860,38,"    i had no human fears,"
1861,38,she seemed a thing that could not feel
1862,38,"    the touch of earthly years,"
1863,38,"no motion has she now, no force;"
1864,38,    she neither hears nor sees;
1865,38,"rolled round in earth's diurnal course,"
1866,38,"    with rocks, and stones, and trees,"
1867,39,"i travelled among unknown men,"
1868,39,       in lands beyond the sea;
1869,39,"nor, england! did i know till then"
1870,39,"       what love i bore to thee,"
1871,39,
1872,39,"'tis past, that melancholy dream!"
1873,39,       nor will i quit thy shore
1874,39,a second time; for still i seem
1875,39,"       to love thee more and more,"
1876,39,
1877,39,among thy mountains did i feel
1878,39,      the joy of my desire;
1879,39,and she i cherished turned her wheel
1880,39,"      beside an english fire,"
1881,39,
1882,39,"thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,"
1883,39,      the bowers where lucy played;
1884,39,and thine too is the last green field
1885,39,"      that lucy's eyes surveyed,"
1886,40,"three years she grew in sun and shower,"
1887,40,"then nature said, a lovelier flower"
1888,40,on earth was never sown;
1889,40,this child i to myself will take;
1890,40,"she shall be mine, and i will make"
1891,40,"a lady of my own,"
1892,40,
1893,40,myself will to my darling be
1894,40,"both law and impulse, and with me"
1895,40,"the girl, in rock and plain"
1896,40,"in earth and heaven, in glade and bower,"
1897,40,shall feel an overseeing power
1898,40,"to kindle or restrain,"
1899,40,
1900,40,she shall be sportive as the fawn
1901,40,that wild with glee across the lawn
1902,40,or up the mountain springs;
1903,40,"and her's shall be the breathing balm,"
1904,40,and her's the silence and the calm
1905,40,"of mute insensate things,"
1906,40,
1907,40,the floating clouds their state shall lend
1908,40,to her; for her the willow bend;
1909,40,nor shall she fail to see
1910,40,even in the motions of the storm
1911,40,grace that shall mold the maiden's form
1912,40,"by silent sympathy,"
1913,40,
1914,40,the stars of midnight shall be dear
1915,40,to her; and she shall lean her ear
1916,40,in many a secret place
1917,40,"where rivulets dance their wayward round,"
1918,40,and beauty born of murmuring sound
1919,40,"shall pass into her face,"
1920,40,
1921,40,and vital feelings of delight
1922,40,"shall rear her form to stately height,"
1923,40,her virgin bosom swell;
1924,40,such thoughts to lucy i will give
1925,40,while she and i together live
1926,40,"here in this happy dell,"
1927,40,
1928,40,thus nature spake---the work was done---
1929,40,how soon my lucy's race was run!
1930,40,"she died, and left to me"
1931,40,"this heath, this calm, and quiet scene;"
1932,40,"the memory of what has been,"
1933,40,"and never more will be,"
1934,41,a pen--to register; a key--
1935,41,that winds through secret wards
1936,41,are well assigned to memory
1937,41,"by allegoric bards,"
1938,41,
1939,41,"as aptly, also, might be given"
1940,41,a pencil to her hand;
1941,41,"that, softening objects, sometimes even"
1942,41,outstrips the heart's demand;
1943,41,
1944,41,"that smooths foregone distress, the lines"
1945,41,"of lingering care subdues,"
1946,41,"long-vanished happiness refines,"
1947,41,and clothes in brighter hues;
1948,41,
1949,41,"yet, like a tool of fancy, works"
1950,41,those spectres to dilate
1951,41,"that startle conscience, as she lurks"
1952,41,"within her lonely seat,"
1953,41,
1954,41,"oh! that our lives, which flee so fast,"
1955,41,"in purity were such,"
1956,41,that not an image of the past
1957,41,should fear that pencil's touch!
1958,41,
1959,41,retirement then might hourly look
1960,41,"upon a soothing scene,"
1961,41,age steal to his allotted nook
1962,41,contented and serene;
1963,41,
1964,41,"with heart as calm as lakes that sleep,"
1965,41,in frosty moonlight glistening;
1966,41,"or mountain rivers, where they creep"
1967,41,"along a channel smooth and deep,"
1968,41,"to their own far-off murmurs listening,"
1969,42,",  if from the public way you turn your steps"
1970,42,"   up the tumultuous brook of green-head ghyll,"
1971,42,   you will suppose that with an upright path
1972,42,   your feet must struggle; in such bold ascent
1973,42,"   the pastoral mountains front you, face to face,"
1974,42,"   but, courage! for around that boisterous brook"
1975,42,"   the mountains have all opened out themselves,"
1976,42,"   and made a hidden valley of their own,"
1977,42,   no habitation can be seen; but they
1978,42,  who journey thither find themselves alone
1979,42,"  with a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites"
1980,42,"  that overhead are sailing in the sky,"
1981,42,  it is in truth an utter solitude;
1982,42,  nor should i have made mention of this dell
1983,42,"  but for one object which you might pass by,"
1984,42,"  might see and notice not, beside the brook"
1985,42,  appears a straggling heap of unhewn stones!
1986,42,  and to that simple object appertains
1987,42,"  a story--unenriched with strange events,"
1988,42,"  yet not unfit, i deem, for the fireside,"
1989,42,"  or for the summer shade, it was the first"
1990,42,  of those domestic tales that spake to me
1991,42,"  of shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men"
1992,42,  whom i already loved;--not verily
1993,42,"  for their own sakes, but for the fields and hills"
1994,42,"  where was their occupation and abode,"
1995,42,"  and hence this tale, while i was yet a boy"
1996,42,"  careless of books, yet having felt the power"
1997,42,"  of nature, by the gentle agency"
1998,42,"  of natural objects, led me on to feel"
1999,42,"  for passions that were not my own, and think"
2000,42,  at random and imperfectly indeed
2001,42,"  on man, the heart of man, and human life,"
2002,42,"  therefore, although it be a history"
2003,42,"  homely and rude, i will relate the same"
2004,42,  for the delight of a few natural hearts;
2005,42,"  and, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake"
2006,42,"  of youthful poets, who among these hills"
2007,42,"  will be my second self when i am gone,"
2008,42,
2009,42,      upon the forest-side in grasmere vale
2010,42,"  there dwelt a shepherd, michael was his name;"
2011,42,"  an old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb,"
2012,42,  his bodily frame had been from youth to age
2013,42,"  of an unusual strength, his mind was keen,"
2014,42,"  intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,"
2015,42,  and in his shepherd's calling he was prompt
2016,42,"  and watchful more than ordinary men,"
2017,42,"  hence had he learned the meaning of all winds,"
2018,42,"  of blasts of every tone; and oftentimes,"
2019,42,"  when others heeded not, he heard the south"
2020,42,"  make subterraneous music, like the noise"
2021,42,"  of bagpipers on distant highland hills,"
2022,42,"  the shepherd, at such warning, of his flock"
2023,42,"  bethought him, and he to himself would say,"
2024,42,  the winds are now devising work for me!
2025,42,"  and, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives"
2026,42,"  the traveller to a shelter, summoned him"
2027,42,"  up to the mountains, he had been alone"
2028,42,"  amid the heart of many thousand mists,"
2029,42,"   that came to him, and left him, on the heights,"
2030,42,"  so lived he till his eightieth year was past,"
2031,42,"  and grossly that man errs, who should suppose"
2032,42,"  that the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,"
2033,42,"  were things indifferent to the shepherd's thoughts,"
2034,42,"  fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed"
2035,42,"  the common air; hills, which with vigorous step"
2036,42,  he had so often climbed; which had impressed
2037,42,  so many incidents upon his mind
2038,42,"  of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;"
2039,42,"  which, like a book, preserved the memory"
2040,42,"  of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,"
2041,42,"  had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts"
2042,42,  the certainty of honourable gain;
2043,42,"  those fields, those hills--what could they less? had laid"
2044,42,"  strong hold on his affections, were to him"
2045,42,"  a pleasurable feeling of blind love,"
2046,42,"  the pleasure which there is in life itself ,"
2047,42,
2048,42,"      his days had not been passed in singleness,"
2049,42,"  his helpmate was a comely matron, old--"
2050,42,"  though younger than himself full twenty years,"
2051,42,"  she was a woman of a stirring life,"
2052,42,"  whose heart was in her house, two wheels she had"
2053,42,"  of antique form; this large, for spinning wool;"
2054,42,"  that small, for flax; and, if one wheel had rest,"
2055,42,"  it was because the other was at work,"
2056,42,"  the pair had but one inmate in their house,"
2057,42,"  an only child, who had been born to them"
2058,42,"  when michael, telling o'er his years, began"
2059,42,"  to deem that he was old,--in shepherd's phrase,"
2060,42,"  with one foot in the grave, this only son,"
2061,42,"  with two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,"
2062,42,"  the one of an inestimable worth,"
2063,42,"  made all their household, i may truly say,"
2064,42,  that they were as a proverb in the vale
2065,42,"  for endless industry, when day was gone,"
2066,42,  and from their occupations out of doors
2067,42,"  the son and father were come home, even then,"
2068,42,  their labour did not cease; unless when all
2069,42,"  turned to the cleanly supper-board, and there,"
2070,42," each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,"
2071,42," sat round the basket piled with oaten cakes,"
2072,42," and their plain home-made cheese, yet when the meal"
2073,42," was ended, luke for so the son was named"
2074,42, and his old father both betook themselves
2075,42, to such convenient work as might employ
2076,42, their hands by the fireside; perhaps to card
2077,42," wool for the housewife's spindle, or repair"
2078,42," some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,"
2079,42," or other implement of house or field,"
2080,42,
2081,42,"    down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge,"
2082,42, that in our ancient uncouth country style
2083,42, with huge and black projection overbrowed
2084,42," large space beneath, as duly as the light"
2085,42," of day grew dim the housewife hung a lamp,"
2086,42," an aged utensil, which had performed"
2087,42," service beyond all others of its kind,"
2088,42," early at evening did it burn--and late,"
2089,42," surviving comrade of uncounted hours,"
2090,42," which, going by from year to year, had found,"
2091,42, and left the couple neither gay perhaps
2092,42," nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,"
2093,42," living a life of eager industry,"
2094,42," and now, when luke had reached his eighteenth year,"
2095,42," there by the light of this old lamp they sate,"
2096,42," father and son, while far into the night"
2097,42," the housewife plied her own peculiar work,"
2098,42, making the cottage through the silent hours
2099,42," murmur as with the sound of summer flies,"
2100,42," this light was famous in its neighbourhood,"
2101,42, and was a public symbol of the life
2102,42," that thrifty pair had lived, for, as it chanced,"
2103,42, their cottage on a plot of rising ground
2104,42," stood single, with large prospect, north and south,"
2105,42," high into easedale, up to dunmail-raise,"
2106,42, and westward to the village near the lake;
2107,42," and from this constant light, so regular"
2108,42," and so far seen, the house itself, by all"
2109,42," who dwelt within the limits of the vale,"
2110,42," both old and young, was named the evening star,"
2111,42,
2112,42,"    thus living on through such a length of years,"
2113,42," the shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs"
2114,42, have loved his helpmate; but to michael's heart
2115,42, this son of his old age was yet more dear--
2116,42," less from instinctive tenderness, the same"
2117,42, fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all--
2118,42," than that a child, more than all other gifts"
2119,42," that earth can offer to declining man,"
2120,42," brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,"
2121,42," and stirrings of inquietude, when they"
2122,42," by tendency of nature needs must fail,"
2123,42," exceeding was the love he bare to him,"
2124,42, his heart and his heart's joy! for oftentimes
2125,42," old michael, while he was a babe in arms,"
2126,42," had done him female service, not alone"
2127,42," for pastime and delight, as is the use"
2128,42," of fathers, but with patient mind enforced"
2129,42, to acts of tenderness; and he had rocked
2130,42," his cradle, as with a woman's gentle hand,"
2131,42,
2132,42,"    and, in a later time, ere yet the boy"
2133,42," had put on boy's attire, did michael love,"
2134,42," albeit of a stern unbending mind,"
2135,42," to have the young-one in his sight, when he"
2136,42," wrought in the field, or on his shepherd's stool"
2137,42, sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched
2138,42," under the large old oak, that near his door"
2139,42," stood single, and, from matchless depth of shade,"
2140,42," chosen for the shearer's covert from the sun,"
2141,42, thence in our rustic dialect was called
2142,42," the clipping tree, a name which yet it bears,"
2143,42," there, while they two were sitting in the shade,"
2144,42," with others round them, earnest all and blithe,"
2145,42, would michael exercise his heart with looks
2146,42, of fond correction and reproof bestowed
2147,42," upon the child, if he disturbed the sheep"
2148,42," by catching at their legs, or with his shouts"
2149,42," scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears,"
2150,42,
2151,42,    and when by heaven's good grace the boy grew up
2152,42," a healthy lad, and carried in his cheek"
2153,42, two steady roses that were five years old;
2154,42, then michael from a winter coppice cut
2155,42," with his own hand a sapling, which he hooped"
2156,42," with iron, making it throughout in all"
2157,42," due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff,"
2158,42, and gave it to the boy; wherewith equipt
2159,42, he as a watchman oftentimes was placed
2160,42," at gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock;"
2161,42," and, to his office prematurely called,"
2162,42," there stood the urchin, as you will divine,"
2163,42," something between a hindrance and a help,"
2164,42," and for this cause not always, i believe,"
2165,42, receiving from his father hire of praise;
2166,42," though nought was left undone which staff, or voice,"
2167,42," or looks, or threatening gestures, could perform,"
2168,42,
2169,42,"    but soon as luke, full ten years old, could stand"
2170,42," against the mountain blasts; and to the heights,"
2171,42," not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,"
2172,42," he with his father daily went, and they"
2173,42," were as companions, why should i relate"
2174,42, that objects which the shepherd loved before
2175,42, were dearer now? that from the boy there came
2176,42, feelings and emanations--things which were
2177,42, light to the sun and music to the wind;
2178,42, and that the old man's heart seemed born again?
2179,42,
2180,42,"    thus in his father's sight the boy grew up,"
2181,42," and now, when he had reached his eighteenth year,"
2182,42," he was his comfort and his daily hope,"
2183,42,
2184,42,    while in this sort the simple household lived
2185,42," from day to day, to michael's ear there came"
2186,42," distressful tidings, long before the time"
2187,42," of which i speak, the shepherd had been bound"
2188,42," in surety for his brother's son, a man"
2189,42," of an industrious life, and ample means;"
2190,42, but unforeseen misfortunes suddenly
2191,42, had prest upon him; and old michael now
2192,42," was summoned to discharge the forfeiture,"
2193,42," a grievous penalty, but little less"
2194,42," than half his substance, this unlooked-for claim"
2195,42," at the first hearing, for a moment took"
2196,42, more hope out of his life than he supposed
2197,42," that any old man ever could have lost,"
2198,42, as soon as he had armed himself with strength
2199,42," to look his trouble in the face, it seemed"
2200,42, the shepherd's sole resource to sell at once
2201,42," a portion of his patrimonial fields,"
2202,42," such was his first resolve; he thought again,"
2203,42," and his heart failed him, isabel, said he,"
2204,42," two evenings after he had heard the news,"
2205,42," i have been toiling more than seventy years,"
2206,42, and in the open sunshine of god's love
2207,42," have we all lived; yet, if these fields of ours"
2208,42," should pass into a stranger's hand, i think"
2209,42," that i could not lie quiet in my grave,"
2210,42, our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself
2211,42, has scarcely been more diligent than i;
2212,42, and i have lived to be a fool at last
2213,42," to my own family, an evil man"
2214,42," that was, and made an evil choice, if he"
2215,42," were false to us; and, if he were not false,"
2216,42, there are ten thousand to whom loss like this
2217,42," had been no sorrow, i forgive him;--but"
2218,42," 'twere better to be dumb than to talk thus,"
2219,42,
2220,42,"    when i began, my purpose was to speak"
2221,42," of remedies and of a cheerful hope,"
2222,42," our luke shall leave us, isabel; the land"
2223,42," shall not go from us, and it shall be free;"
2224,42," he shall possess it, free as is the wind"
2225,42," that passes over it, we have, thou know'st,"
2226,42, another kinsman--he will be our friend
2227,42," in this distress, he is a prosperous man,"
2228,42," thriving in trade and luke to him shall go,"
2229,42, and with his kinsman's help and his own thrift
2230,42," he quickly will repair this loss, and then"
2231,42," he may return to us, if here he stay,"
2232,42," what can be done? where every one is poor,"
2233,42," what can be gained?       at this the old man paused,"
2234,42," and isabel sat silent, for her mind"
2235,42," was busy, looking back into past times,"
2236,42," there's richard bateman, thought she to herself,"
2237,42, he was a parish-boy--at the church-door
2238,42," they made a gathering for him, shillings, pence,"
2239,42," and halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought"
2240,42," a basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;"
2241,42," and, with this basket on his arm, the lad"
2242,42," went up to london, found a master there,"
2243,42," who, out of many, chose the trusty boy"
2244,42, to go and overlook his merchandise
2245,42," beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich,"
2246,42," and left estates and monies to the poor,"
2247,42," and, at his birth-place, built a chapel floored"
2248,42," with marble, which he sent from foreign lands,"
2249,42," these thoughts, and many others of like sort,"
2250,42," passed quickly through the mind of isabel,"
2251,42," and her face brightened, the old man was glad,"
2252,42," and thus resumed,--well, isabel! this scheme"
2253,42," these two days has been meat and drink to me,"
2254,42," far more than we have lost is left us yet,"
2255,42, --we have enough--i wish indeed that i
2256,42," were younger;--but this hope is a good hope,"
2257,42," make ready luke's best garments, of the best"
2258,42," buy for him more, and let us send him forth"
2259,42," to-morrow, or the next day, or to-night,"
2260,42," --if he  could go, the boy should go to-night,"
2261,42,
2262,42,"    here michael ceased, and to the fields went forth"
2263,42," with a light heart, the housewife for five days"
2264,42," was restless morn and night, and all day long"
2265,42," wrought on with her best fingers to prepare,"
2266,42," things needful for the journey of her son,"
2267,42, but isabel was glad when sunday came
2268,42," to stop her in her work, for, when she lay"
2269,42," by michael's side, she through the last two nights"
2270,42," heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep,"
2271,42, and when they rose at morning she could see
2272,42," that all his hopes were gone, that day at noon"
2273,42," she said to luke, while they two by themselves"
2274,42," were sitting at the door, thou must not go,"
2275,42," we have no other child but thee to lose,"
2276,42," none to remember--do not go away,"
2277,42," for if thou leave thy father he will die,"
2278,42, the youth made answer with a jocund voice;
2279,42," and isabel, when she had told her fears,"
2280,42," recovered heart, that evening her best fare"
2281,42," did she bring forth, and all together sat"
2282,42," like happy people round a christmas fire,"
2283,42,
2284,42,    with daylight isabel resumed her work;
2285,42, and all the ensuing week the house appeared
2286,42," as cheerful as a grove in spring, at length"
2287,42," the expected letter from their kinsman came,"
2288,42, with kind assurances that he would do
2289,42, his utmost for the welfare of the boy;
2290,42," to which requests were added, that forthwith"
2291,42," he might be sent to him, ten times or more"
2292,42," the letter was read over, isabel"
2293,42, went forth to show it to the neighbours round;
2294,42, nor was there at that time on english land
2295,42," a prouder heart than luke's, when isabel"
2296,42," had to her house returned, the old man said,"
2297,42," he shall depart to-morrow, to this word"
2298,42," the housewife answered, talking much of things"
2299,42," which, if at such short notice he should go,"
2300,42," would surely be forgotten, but at length"
2301,42," she gave consent, and michael was at ease,"
2302,42,
2303,42,"    near the tumultuous brook of green-head ghyll,"
2304,42," in that deep valley, michael had designed"
2305,42," to build a sheep-fold; and, before he heard"
2306,42," the tidings of his melancholy loss,"
2307,42, for this same purpose he had gathered up
2308,42," a heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge"
2309,42," lay thrown together, ready for the work,"
2310,42," with luke that evening thitherward he walked,"
2311,42," and soon as they had reached the place he stopped,"
2312,42," and thus the old man spake to him,--my son,"
2313,42," to-morrow thou wilt leave me, with full heart"
2314,42," i look upon thee, for thou art the same"
2315,42," that wert a promise to me ere thy birth,"
2316,42," and all thy life hast been my daily joy,"
2317,42, i will relate to thee some little part
2318,42, of our two histories; 'twill do thee good
2319,42," when thou art from me, even if i should touch"
2320,42," on things thou canst not know of,--after thou"
2321,42, first cam'st into the world--as oft befalls
2322,42, to new-born infants--thou didst sleep away
2323,42," two days, and blessings from thy father's tongue"
2324,42," then fell upon thee, day by day passed on,"
2325,42," and still i loved thee with increasing love,"
2326,42, never to living ear came sweeter sounds
2327,42, than when i heard thee by our own fireside
2328,42," first uttering, without words, a natural tune;"
2329,42," while thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy"
2330,42," sing at thy mother's breast, month followed month,"
2331,42," and in the open fields my life was passed,"
2332,42, and on the mountains; else i think that thou
2333,42," hadst been brought up upon thy father's knees,"
2334,42," but we were playmates, luke, among these hills,"
2335,42," as well thou knowest, in us the old and young"
2336,42," have played together, nor with me didst thou"
2337,42," lack any pleasure which a boy can know,"
2338,42, luke had a manly heart; but at these words
2339,42," he sobbed aloud, the old man grasped his hand,"
2340,42," and said, nay, do not take it so--i see"
2341,42," that these are things of which i need not speak,"
2342,42, --even to the utmost i have been to thee
2343,42," a kind and a good father, and herein"
2344,42, i but repay a gift which i myself
2345,42," received at others' hands; for, though now old"
2346,42," beyond the common life of man, i still"
2347,42," remember them who loved me in my youth,"
2348,42," both of them sleep together, here they lived,"
2349,42," as all their forefathers had done; and, when"
2350,42," at length their time was come, they were not loth"
2351,42," to give their bodies to the family mould,"
2352,42," i wished that thou should'st live the life they lived,"
2353,42," but, 'tis a long time to look back, my son,"
2354,42," and see so little gain from threescore years,"
2355,42, these fields were burthened when they came to me;
2356,42," till i was forty years of age, not more"
2357,42," than half of my inheritance was mine,"
2358,42," i toiled and toiled; god blessed me in my work,"
2359,42," and till these three weeks past the land was free,"
2360,42, --it looks as if it never could endure
2361,42," another master, heaven forgive me, luke,"
2362,42," if i judge ill for thee, but it seems good"
2363,42," that thou should'st go,       at this the old man paused;"
2364,42," then, pointing to the stones near which they stood,"
2365,42," thus, after a short silence, he resumed,"
2366,42," this was a work for us; and now, my son,"
2367,42," it is a work for me, but, lay one stone--"
2368,42," here, lay it for me, luke, with thine own hands,"
2369,42," nay, boy, be of good hope;--we both may live"
2370,42," to see a better day, at eighty-four"
2371,42, i still am strong and hale;--do thou thy part;
2372,42," i will do mine,--i will begin again"
2373,42," with many tasks that were resigned to thee,"
2374,42," up to the heights, and in among the storms,"
2375,42," will i without thee go again, and do"
2376,42," all works which i was wont to do alone,"
2377,42," before i knew thy face,--heaven bless thee, boy!"
2378,42, thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast
2379,42, with many hopes; it should be so--yes--yes--
2380,42, i knew that thou could'st never have a wish
2381,42," to leave me, luke, thou hast been bound to me"
2382,42," only by links of love, when thou art gone,"
2383,42," what will be left to us!--but, i forget"
2384,42," my purposes, lay now the corner-stone,"
2385,42," as i requested; and hereafter, luke,"
2386,42," when thou art gone away, should evil men"
2387,42," be thy companions, think of me, my son,"
2388,42," and of this moment; hither turn thy thoughts,"
2389,42," and god will strengthen thee, amid all fear"
2390,42," and all temptation, luke, i pray that thou"
2391,42," may'st bear in mind the life thy fathers lived,"
2392,42," who, being innocent, did for that cause"
2393,42," bestir them in good deeds, now, fare thee well--"
2394,42," when thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see"
2395,42," a work which is not here, a covenant"
2396,42," 'twill be between us; but, whatever fate"
2397,42," befall thee, i shall love thee to the last,"
2398,42," and bear thy memory with me to the grave,"
2399,42,
2400,42,"    the shepherd ended here; and luke stooped down,"
2401,42," and, as his father had requested, laid"
2402,42," the first stone of the sheep-fold, at the sight"
2403,42, the old man's grief broke from him; to his heart
2404,42," he pressed his son, he kissed him and wept;"
2405,42," and to the house together they returned,"
2406,42," --hushed was that house in peace, or seeming peace,"
2407,42," ere the night fell,--with morrow's dawn the boy"
2408,42," began his journey, and, when he had reached"
2409,42," the public way, he put on a bold face;"
2410,42," and all the neighbours, as he passed their doors,"
2411,42," came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers,"
2412,42," that followed him till he was out of sight,"
2413,42," a good report did from their kinsman come,"
2414,42, of luke and his well-doing; and the boy
2415,42," wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,"
2416,42," which, as the housewife phrased it, were throughout"
2417,42," the prettiest letters that were ever seen,"
2418,42," both parents read them with rejoicing hearts,"
2419,42," so, many months passed on, and once again"
2420,42, the shepherd went about his daily work
2421,42, with confident and cheerful thoughts; and now
2422,42, sometimes when he could find a leisure hour
2423,42," he to that valley took his way, and there"
2424,42," wrought at the sheep-fold, meantime luke began"
2425,42," to slacken in his duty; and, at length,"
2426,42, he in the dissolute city gave himself
2427,42," to evil courses, ignominy and shame"
2428,42," fell on him, so that he was driven at last"
2429,42," to seek a hiding-place beyond the seas,"
2430,42,
2431,42,    there is a comfort in the strength of love;
2432,42," 'twill make a thing endurable, which else"
2433,42," would overset the brain, or break the heart,"
2434,42, i have conversed with more than one who well
2435,42," remember the old man, and what he was"
2436,42," years after he had heard this heavy news,"
2437,42, his bodily frame had been from youth to age
2438,42," of an unusual strength, among the rocks"
2439,42," he went, and still looked up to sun and cloud,"
2440,42," and listened to the wind; and, as before,"
2441,42," performed all kinds of labour for his sheep,"
2442,42," and for the land, his small inheritance,"
2443,42, and to that hollow dell from time to time
2444,42," did he repair, to build the fold of which"
2445,42," his flock had need, 'tis not forgotten yet"
2446,42, the pity which was then in every heart
2447,42, for the old man--and 'tis believed by all
2448,42," that many and many a day he thither went,"
2449,42," and never lifted up a single stone,"
2450,42,
2451,42,"    there, by the sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen"
2452,42," sitting alone, or with his faithful dog,"
2453,42," then old, beside him, lying at his feet,"
2454,42," the length of full seven years, from time to time,"
2455,42," he at the building of this sheep-fold wrought,"
2456,42," and left the work unfinished when he died,"
2457,42," three years, or little more, did isabel"
2458,42," survive her husband, at her death the estate"
2459,42," was sold, and went into a stranger's hand,"
2460,42, the cottage which was named the evening star
2461,42, is gone--the ploughshare has been through the ground
2462,42, on which it stood; great changes have been wrought
2463,42," in all the neighbourhood,--yet the oak is left"
2464,42, that grew beside their door; and the remains
2465,42, of the unfinished sheep-fold may be seen
2466,42," beside the boisterous brook of green-head ghyll,"
2467,43,",  most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes"
2468,43,"   to pace the ground, if path be there or none,"
2469,43,   while a fair region round the traveller lies
2470,43,   which he forbears again to look upon;
2471,43,"   pleased rather with some soft ideal scene,"
2472,43,"   the work of fancy, or some happy tone"
2473,43,"   of meditation, slipping in between"
2474,43,"   the beauty coming and the beauty gone,"
2475,43,"   if thought and love desert us, from that day"
2476,43,"  let us break off all commerce with the muse,"
2477,43,"  with thought and love companions of our way,"
2478,43,"  whate'er the senses take or may refuse,"
2479,43,  the mind's internal heaven shall shed her dews
2480,43,"  of inspiration on the humblest lay,"
2481,44,",    from low to high doth dissolution climb,"
2482,44,"   and sink from high to low, along a scale"
2483,44,"   of awful notes, whose concord shall not fail;"
2484,44,"   a musical but melancholy chime,"
2485,44,"   which they can hear who meddle not with crime,"
2486,44,"   nor avarice, nor over-anxious care,"
2487,44,   truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear
2488,44,"   the longest date do melt like frosty rime,"
2489,44,   that in the morning whitened hill and plain
2490,44,  and is no more; drop like the tower sublime
2491,44,"  of yesterday, which royally did wear"
2492,44,"  his crown of weeds, but could not even sustain"
2493,44,"  some casual shout that broke the silent air,"
2494,44,"  or the unimaginable touch of time,"
2495,45,",   another year!--another deadly blow!"
2496,45,   another mighty empire overthrown!
2497,45,"   and we are left, or shall be left, alone;"
2498,45,"   the last that dare to struggle with the foe,"
2499,45,   'tis well! from this day forward we shall know
2500,45,   that in ourselves our safety must be sought;
2501,45,   that by our own right hands it must be wrought;
2502,45,"   that we must stand unpropped, or be laid low,"
2503,45,   o dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!
2504,45,"  we shall exult, if they who rule the land"
2505,45,"  be men who hold its many blessings dear,"
2506,45,"  wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,"
2507,45,"  who are to judge of danger which they fear,"
2508,45,"  and honour which they do not understand,"
2509,46,nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room;
2510,46,and hermits are contented with their cells;
2511,46,and students with their pensive citadels;
2512,46,"maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,"
2513,46,"sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,"
2514,46,"high as the highest peak of furness-fells,"
2515,46,"will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells,"
2516,46,"in truth the prison, unto which we doom"
2517,46,"ourselves, no prison is, and hence for me,"
2518,46,"in sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound"
2519,46,within the sonnet's scanty plot of ground;
2520,46,pleased if some souls for such there needs must be
2521,46,"who have felt the weight of too much liberty,"
2522,46,"should find brief solace there, as i have found,"
2523,47,",         --it seems a day"
2524,47,   i speak of one from many singled out
2525,47,   one of those heavenly days that cannot die;
2526,47,"   when, in the eagerness of boyish hope,"
2527,47,"   i left our cottage-threshold, sallying forth"
2528,47,"   with a huge wallet o'er my shoulders slung,"
2529,47,   a nutting-crook in hand; and turned my steps
2530,47,"   tow'rd some far-distant wood, a figure quaint,"
2531,47,   tricked out in proud disguise of cast-off weeds
2532,47,"  which for that service had been husbanded,"
2533,47,  by exhortation of my frugal dame--
2534,47,"  motley accoutrement, of power to smile"
2535,47,"  at thorns, and brakes, and brambles,--and, in truth,"
2536,47,"  more ragged than need was! o'er pathless rocks,"
2537,47,"  through beds of matted fern, and tangled thickets,"
2538,47,"  forcing my way, i came to one dear nook"
2539,47,"  unvisited, where not a broken bough"
2540,47,"  drooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign"
2541,47,  of devastation; but the hazels rose
2542,47,"  tall and erect, with tempting clusters hung,"
2543,47,"  a virgin scene!--a little while i stood,"
2544,47,  breathing with such suppression of the heart
2545,47,"  as joy delights in; and, with wise restraint"
2546,47,"  voluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed"
2547,47,  the banquet;--or beneath the trees i sate
2548,47,"  among the flowers, and with the flowers i played;"
2549,47,"  a temper known to those, who, after long"
2550,47,"  and weary expectation, have been blest"
2551,47,"  with sudden happiness beyond all hope,"
2552,47,  perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves
2553,47,  the violets of five seasons re-appear
2554,47,"  and fade, unseen by any human eye;"
2555,47,  where fairy water-breaks do murmur on
2556,47,"  for ever; and i saw the sparkling foam,"
2557,47,  and--with my cheek on one of those green stones
2558,47,"  that, fleeced with moss, under the shady trees,"
2559,47,"  lay round me, scattered like a flock of sheep--"
2560,47,"  i heard the murmur, and the murmuring sound,"
2561,47,  in that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay
2562,47,"  tribute to ease; and, of its joy secure,"
2563,47,"  the heart luxuriates with indifferent things,"
2564,47,"  wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones,"
2565,47,"  and on the vacant air, then up i rose,"
2566,47,"  and dragged to earth both branch and bough, with crash"
2567,47,"  and merciless ravage, and the shady nook"
2568,47,"  of hazels, and the green and mossy bower,"
2569,47,"  deformed and sullied, patiently gave up"
2570,47,"  their quiet being, and, unless i now"
2571,47,  confound my present feelings with the past;
2572,47,  ere from the mutilated bower i turned
2573,47,"  exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings,"
2574,47,  i felt a sense of pain when i beheld
2575,47,"  the silent trees, and saw the intruding sky,--"
2576,47,"  then, dearest maiden, move along these shades"
2577,47,  in gentleness of heart; with gentle hand
2578,47,"  touch--for there is a spirit in the woods,"
2579,48,o nightingale! thou surely art
2580,48,"a creature of a fiery heart,--"
2581,48,these notes of thine--they pierce and pierce;
2582,48,tumultuous harmony and fierce!
2583,48,thou sing'st as if the god of wine
2584,48,had helped thee to a valentine;
2585,48,a song in mockery and despite
2586,48,"of shades, and dews, and silent night;"
2587,48,"and steady bliss, and all the loves"
2588,48,"now sleeping in these peaceful groves,"
2589,48,i heard a stock-dove sing or say
2590,48,"his homely tale, this very day;"
2591,48,"his voice was buried among trees,"
2592,48,"yet to be come at by the breeze,"
2593,48,he did not cease; but cooed--and cooed;
2594,48,"and somewhat pensively he wooed,"
2595,48,"he sang of love, with quiet blending,"
2596,48,"slow to begin, and never ending;"
2597,48,"of serious faith, and inward glee;"
2598,48,that was the song -- the song for me!
2599,49,",  these times strike monied worldlings with dismay,"
2600,49,"  even rich men, brave by nature, taint the air"
2601,49,"  with words of apprehension and despair,"
2602,49,"  while tens of thousands, thinking on the affray,"
2603,49,  men unto whom sufficient for the day
2604,49,"  and minds not stinted or untilled are given,"
2605,49,"  sound, healthy, children of the god of heaven,"
2606,49,"  are cheerful as the rising sun in may,"
2607,49,  what do we gather hence but firmer faith
2608,49, that every gift of noble origin
2609,49, is breathed upon by hope's perpetual breath;
2610,49, that virtue and the faculties within
2611,49," are vital,--and that riches are akin"
2612,49," to fear, to change, to cowardice, and death?"
2613,50,while from the purpling east departs
2614,50,"    the star that led the dawn,"
2615,50,"blithe flora from her couch upstarts,"
2616,50,"    for may is on the lawn,"
2617,50,"a quickening hope, a freshening glee,"
2618,50,"    foreran the expected power,"
2619,50,"whose first-drawn breath, from bush and tree,"
2620,50,"    shakes off that pearly shower,"
2621,50,
2622,50,all nature welcomes her whose sway
2623,50,    tempers the year's extremes;
2624,50,"who scattereth lustres o'er noon-day,"

2626,50,"while mellow warble, sprightly trill,"
2627,50,    the tremulous heart excite;
2628,50,and hums the balmy air to still
2629,50,"    the balance of delight,"

2631,50,"time was, blest power! when youth and maids"
2632,50,"    at peep of dawn would rise,"
2633,50,"and wander forth, in forest glades"
2634,50,"    thy birth to solemnize,"
2635,50,though mute the song---to grace the rite
2636,50,"    untouched the hawthorn bough,"
2637,50,thy spirit triumphs o'er the slight;

2643,50,"    awake to silent joy,"
2644,50,queen art thou still for each gay plant
2645,50,    where the slim wild deer roves;
2646,50,and served in depths where fishes haunt
2647,50,"    their own mysterious groves,"
2648,50,
2649,50,"cloud-piercing peak, and trackless heath,"
2650,50,    instinctive homage pay;
2651,50,nor wants the dim-lit cave a wreath
2652,50,"    to honor thee, sweet may!"
2653,50,where cities fanned by thy brisk airs
2654,50,"    behold a smokeless sky,"
2655,50,their puniest flower-pot-nursling dares
2656,50,"    to open a bright eye,"
2657,50,
2658,50,"and if, on this thy natal morn,"
2659,50,"    the pole, from which thy name"
2660,50,"hath not departed, stands forlorn"
2661,50,    of song and dance and game;

2663,50,"    aspires to thee addrest,"
2664,50,"wherever peace is on the brow,"
2665,50,"    or love within the breast,"
2666,50,
2667,50,yes! where love nestles thou canst teach
2668,50,    the soul to love the more;

2672,50,"    the bashful freed from fear,"
2673,50,"while rising, like the ocean-tide,"
2674,50,"    in flow the joyous year,"
2675,50,
2676,50,"hush, feeble lyre! weak words refuse"
2677,50,    the service to prolong!
2678,50,to yon exulting thrush the muse
2679,50,    entrusts the imperfect song;

3144,53,
3145,53,             o joy! that in our embers
3146,53,"             is something that doth live,"
3147,53,             that nature yet remembers
3148,53,             what was so fugitive!
3149,53,         the thought of our past years in me doth breed
3150,53,"         perpetual benediction, not indeed"
3151,53,         for that which is most worthy to be blest--
3152,53,"         delight and liberty, the simple creed"
3153,53,"         of childhood, whether busy or at rest,"
3154,53,"         with new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast,--"
3155,53,             not for these i raise
3156,53,             the song of thanks and praise;
3157,53,           but for those obstinate questionings
3158,53,"           of sense and outward things,"
3159,53,"           fallings from us, vanishings;"
3160,53,           blank misgivings of a creature
3161,53,"         moving about in worlds not realised,"
3162,53,         high instincts before which our mortal nature
3163,53,"         did tremble like a guilty thing surprised,"
3164,53,"             but for those first affections,"
3165,53,"             those shadowy recollections,"
3166,53,"           which, be they what they may,"
3167,53,"         are yet the fountain light of all our day,"
3168,53,         are yet a master light of all our seeing;
3169,53,"           uphold us, cherish, and have power to make"
3170,53,         our noisy years seem moments in the being
3171,53,"         of the eternal silence, truths that wake,"
3172,53,             to perish never;
3173,53,"         which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,"
3174,53,"             nor man nor boy,"
3175,53,"         nor all that is at enmity with joy,"
3176,53,         can utterly abolish or destroy!
3177,53,             hence in a season of calm weather
3178,53,"             though inland far we be,"
3179,53,         our souls have sight of that immortal sea
3180,53,"             which brought us hither,"
3181,53,"             can in a moment travel thither,"
3182,53,"         and see the children sport upon the shore,"
3183,53,"         and hear the mighty waters rolling evermore,"

3188,53,             and let the young lambs bound
3189,53,             as to the tabor's sound!

3193,53,             feel the gladness of the may!
3194,53,         what though the radiance which was once so bright
3195,53,"         be now for ever taken from my sight,"
3196,53,             though nothing can bring back the hour
3197,53,"         of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;"
3198,53,"             we will grieve not, rather find"
3199,53,             strength in what remains behind;
3200,53,             in the primal sympathy
3201,53,             which having been must ever be;
3202,53,             in the soothing thoughts that spring
3203,53,             out of human suffering;
3204,53,"             in the faith that looks through death,"
3205,53,"         in years that bring the philosophic mind,"

3210,53,         forebode not any severing of our loves!
3211,53,         yet in my heart of hearts i feel your might;
3212,53,         i only have relinquished one delight
3213,53,"         to live beneath your more habitual sway,"
3214,53,"         i love the brooks which down their channels fret,"
3215,53,         even more than when i tripped lightly as they;
3216,53,         the innocent brightness of a new-born day
3217,53,                     is lovely yet;
3218,53,         the clouds that gather round the setting sun
3219,53,         do take a sober colouring from an eye
3220,53,         that hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;
3221,53,"         another race hath been, and other palms are won,"
3222,53,"         thanks to the human heart by which we live,"
3223,53,"         thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,"
3224,53,         to me the meanest flower that blows can give
3225,53,"         thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears,"
3226,54,"before i see another day,"
3227,54,oh let my body die away!
3228,54,in sleep i heard the northern gleams;
3229,54,"the stars, they were among my dreams;"
3230,54,"in rustling conflict through the skies,"
3231,54,"i heard, i saw the flashes drive,"
3232,54,"and yet they are upon my eyes,"
3233,54,and yet i am alive;
3234,54,"before i see another day,"
3235,54,oh let my body die away!
3236,54,
3237,54,"my fire is dead, it knew no pain;"
3238,54,"yet is it dead, and i remain,"
3239,54,all stiff with ice the ashes lie;
3240,54,"and they are dead, and i will die,"
3241,54,"when i was well, i wished to live,"
3242,54,"for clothes, for warmth, for food, and fire;"
3243,54,"but they to me no joy can give,"
3244,54,"no pleasure now, and no desire,"
3245,54,then here contented will i lie
3246,54,"alone, i cannot fear to die,"
3247,54,
3248,54,alas! ye might have dragged me on
3249,54,"another day, a single one!"
3250,54,too soon i yielded to despair;
3251,54,why did ye listen to my prayer
3252,54,when ye were gone my limb were stronger;
3253,54,"and oh, how grievously i rue,"
3254,54,"that, afterward, a little longer,"
3255,54,"my friends, i did not follow you!"
3256,54,"for strong and without pain i lay,"
3257,54,"dear friends, when ye were gone away,"
3258,54,
3259,54,"my child! they gave thee to another,"
3260,54,"a woman who was not thy mother,"
3261,54,"when from my arms my babe they took,"
3262,54,on me how strangely did he look !
3263,54,"through his whole body something ran,"
3264,54,a most strange working did i see;
3265,54,"---as if he strove to be a man,"
3266,54,"that he might pull the sledge for me,"
3267,54,"and then he stretched his arm, how wild!"
3268,54,"oh mercy! like a helpless child,"
3269,54,
3270,54,my little joy! my little pride!
3271,54,"in two day more i must have died,"
3272,54,then do not weep and grieve for me;
3273,54,"i feel i must have died with thee,"
3274,54,"o wind, that o'er my head art flying"
3275,54,"the way my friends their course did bend,"
3276,54,"i should not feel the pain of dying,"
3277,54,could i with thee a message end;
3278,54,"too soon, my friend, ye went away;"
3279,54,"for i had many thing to say,"
3280,54,
3281,54,i'll follow you across the snow;
3282,54,ye travel heavily and slow;
3283,54,in spite of all my weary pain
3284,54,"i'll look upon your tent again,"
3285,54,"---my fire is dead, and snowy white"
3286,54,"the water which beside it stood,"
3287,54,"the wolf has come to me to-night,"
3288,54,"and he has stolen away my food,"
3289,54,forever left alone am i;
3290,54,then wherefore should i fear to die ?
3291,54,
3292,54,"young as i am, my course is run,"
3293,54,i shall not see another sun;
3294,54,i cannot lift my limb to know
3295,54,"if they have any life or no,"
3296,54,"my poor forsaken child, if i"
3297,54,"for once could have thee close to me,"
3298,54,"with happy heart i then would die,"
3299,54,and my last thought would happy be;
3300,54,"but thou, dear babe, art far away,"
3301,54,"nor shall i see another day,"
3302,55,",   a trouble, not of clouds, or weeping rain,"
3303,55,   nor of the setting sun's pathetic light
3304,55,"   engendered, hangs o'er eildon's triple height,"
3305,55,"   spirits of power, assembled there, complain"
3306,55,   for kindred power departing from their sight;
3307,55,"   while tweed, best pleased in chanting a blithe strain,"
3308,55,"   saddens his voice again, and yet again,"
3309,55,"   lift up your hearts, ye mourners! for the might"
3310,55,   of the whole world's good wishes with him goes;
3311,55,  blessings and prayers in nobler retinue
3312,55,"  than sceptred king or laurelled conqueror knows,"
3313,55,"  follow this wondrous potentate, be true,"
3314,55,"  ye winds of ocean, and the midland sea,"
3315,55,  wafting your charge to soft parthenope!
3316,56,",   once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee;"
3317,56,"   and was the safeguard of the west, the worth"
3318,56,"   of venice did not fall below her birth,"
3319,56,"   venice, the eldest child of liberty,"
3320,56,"   she was a maiden city, bright and free;"
3321,56,"   no guile seduced, no force could violate;"
3322,56,"   and, when she took unto herself a mate,"
3323,56,"   she must espouse the everlasting sea,"
3324,56,"   and what if she had seen those glories fade,"
3325,56,"  those titles vanish, and that strength decay;"
3326,56,  yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
3327,56,"  when her long life hath reached its final day,"
3328,56,"  men are we, and must grieve when even the shade"
3329,56,"  of that which once was great is passed away,"
3330,57,", there was a roaring in the wind all night;"
3331,57,   the rain came heavily and fell in floods;
3332,57,   but now the sun is rising calm and bright;
3333,57,   the birds are singing in the distant woods;
3334,57,   over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods;
3335,57,   the jay makes answer as the magpie chatters;
3336,57,"   and all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters,"
3337,57,   all things that love the sun are out of doors;
3338,57,   the sky rejoices in the morning's birth;
3339,57,  the grass is bright with rain-drops;--on the moors
3340,57,  the hare is running races in her mirth;
3341,57,  and with her feet she from the plashy earth
3342,57,"  raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun,"
3343,57,"  runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run,"
3344,57,
3345,57,  i was a traveller then upon the moor;
3346,57,  i saw the hare that raced about with joy;
3347,57,  i heard the woods and distant waters roar;
3348,57,"  or heard them not, as happy as a boy,"
3349,57,"  the pleasant season did my heart employ,"
3350,57,  my old remembrances went from me wholly;
3351,57,"  and all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy,"
3352,57,
3353,57,"  but, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might"
3354,57,"  of joys in minds that can no further go,"
3355,57,  as high as we have mounted in delight
3356,57,  in our dejection do we sink as low;
3357,57,  to me that morning did it happen so;
3358,57,  and fears and fancies thick upon me came;
3359,57,"  dim sadness--and blind thoughts, i knew not, nor could name,"
3360,57,
3361,57,  i heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky;
3362,57,"  and i bethought me of the playful hare,"
3363,57,  even such a happy child of earth am i;
3364,57,  even as these blissful creatures do i fare;
3365,57,"  far from the world i walk, and from all care;"
3366,57,  but there may come another day to me--
3367,57,"  solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty,"
3368,57,
3369,57,"  my whole life i have lived in pleasant thought,"
3370,57,  as if life's business were a summer mood;
3371,57,  as if all needful things would come unsought
3372,57,"  to genial faith, still rich in genial good;"
3373,57,  but how can he expect that others should
3374,57,"  build for him, sow for him, and at his call"
3375,57,"  love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?"
3376,57,
3377,57,"  i thought of chatterton, the marvellous boy,"
3378,57,  the sleepless soul that perished in his pride;
3379,57,  of him who walked in glory and in joy
3380,57,"  following his plough, along the mountain-side,"
3381,57,"  by our own spirits are we deified,"
3382,57,  we poets in our youth begin in gladness;
3383,57,"  but thereof come in the end despondency and madness,"
3384,57,
3385,57,"  now, whether it were by peculiar grace,"
3386,57,"  a leading from above, a something given,"
3387,57,"  yet it befell that, in this lonely place,"
3388,57,"  when i with these untoward thoughts had striven,"
3389,57,  beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven
3390,57,"  i saw a man before me unawares,"
3391,57,"  the oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs,"
3392,57,
3393,57,  as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie
3394,57,  couched on the bald top of an eminence;
3395,57,"  wonder to all who do the same espy,"
3396,57,"   by what means it could thither come, and whence;"
3397,57,"  so that it seems a thing endued with sense,"
3398,57,"  like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf"
3399,57,"  of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;"
3400,57,
3401,57,"  such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead,"
3402,57,"  nor all asleep--in his extreme old age,"
3403,57,"  his body was bent double, feet and head"
3404,57,  coming together in life's pilgrimage;
3405,57,"  as if some dire constraint of pain, or rage"
3406,57,"  of sickness felt by him in times long past,"
3407,57,"  a more than human weight upon his frame had cast,"
3408,57,
3409,57,"  himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face,"
3410,57,"  upon a long grey staff of shaven wood,"
3411,57,"  and, still as i drew near with gentle pace,"
3412,57,  upon the margin of that moorish flood
3413,57,"  motionless as a cloud the old man stood,"
3414,57,"  that heareth not the loud winds when they call,"
3415,57,"  and moveth all together, if it move at all,"
3416,57,
3417,57,"  at length, himself unsettling, he the pond"
3418,57,"  stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look"
3419,57,"  upon the muddy water, which he conned,"
3420,57,"  as if he had been reading in a book,"
3421,57,  and now a stranger's privilege i took;
3422,57,"  and, drawing to his side, to him did say,"
3423,57,"  this morning gives us promise of a glorious day,"
3424,57,
3425,57,"  a gentle answer did the old man make,"
3426,57,"  in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew,"
3427,57,"  and him with further words i thus bespake,"
3428,57,  what occupation do you there pursue?
3429,57,"  this is a lonesome place for one like you,"
3430,57,"  ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise"
3431,57,"  broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes,"
3432,57,
3433,57,"  his words came feebly, from a feeble chest,"
3434,57,"  but each in solemn order followed each,"
3435,57,  with something of a lofty utterance drest--
3436,57,"  choice word and measured phrase, above the reach"
3437,57,  of ordinary men; a stately speech;
3438,57,"  such as grave livers do in scotland use,"
3439,57,"  religious men, who give to god and man their dues,"
3440,57,
3441,57,"  he told, that to these waters he had come"
3442,57," to gather leeches, being old and poor,"
3443,57, employment hazardous and wearisome!
3444,57," and he had many hardships to endure,"
3445,57," from pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;"
3446,57," housing, with god's good help, by choice or chance;"
3447,57," and in this way he gained an honest maintenance,"
3448,57,
3449,57, the old man still stood talking by my side;
3450,57, but now his voice to me was like a stream
3451,57, scarce heard; nor word from word could i divide;
3452,57, and the whole body of the man did seem
3453,57, like one whom i had met with in a dream;
3454,57," or like a man from some far region sent,"
3455,57," to give me human strength, by apt admonishment,"
3456,57,
3457,57," my former thoughts returned, the fear that kills;"
3458,57, and hope that is unwilling to be fed;
3459,57," cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;"
3460,57," and mighty poets in their misery dead,"
3461,57," --perplexed, and longing to be comforted,"
3462,57," my question eagerly did i renew,"
3463,57," how is it that you live, and what is it you do?"
3464,57,
3465,57, he with a smile did then his words repeat;
3466,57," and said that, gathering leeches, far and wide"
3467,57, he travelled; stirring thus about his feet
3468,57," the waters of the pools where they abide,"
3469,57, once i could meet with them on every side;
3470,57, but they have dwindled long by slow decay;
3471,57," yet still i persevere, and find them where i may,"
3472,57,
3473,57," while he was talking thus, the lonely place,"
3474,57," the old man's shape, and speech--all troubled me,"
3475,57, in my mind's eye i seemed to see him pace
3476,57," about the weary moors continually,"
3477,57," wandering about alone and silently,"
3478,57," while i these thoughts within myself pursued,"
3479,57," he, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed,"
3480,57,
3481,57," and soon with this he other matter blended,"
3482,57," cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,"
3483,57," but stately in the main; and, when he ended,"
3484,57, i could have laughed myself to scorn to find
3485,57," in that decrepit man so firm a mind,"
3486,57," god, said i, be my help and stay secure;"
3487,57, i'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!
3488,58,",   scorn not the sonnet; critic, you have frowned,"
3489,58,   mindless of its just honours; with this key
3490,58,   shakespeare unlocked his heart; the melody
3491,58,   of this small lute gave ease to petrarch's wound;
3492,58,   a thousand times this pipe did tasso sound;
3493,58,   with it camöens soothed an exile's grief;
3494,58,   the sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf
3495,58,   amid the cypress with which dante crowned
3496,58,"   his visionary brow, a glow-worm lamp,"
3497,58,"  it cheered mild spenser, called from faery-land"
3498,58,"  to struggle through dark ways; and, when a damp"
3499,58,"  fell round the path of milton, in his hand"
3500,58,  the thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
3501,58,"  soul-animating strains--alas, too few!"
3502,59,", departing summer hath assumed"
3503,59,"  an aspect tenderly illumed,"
3504,59,  the gentlest look of spring;
3505,59,  that calls from yonder leafy shade
3506,59,"  unfaded, yet prepared to fade,"
3507,59,"  a timely carolling,"
3508,59,"  no faint and hesitating trill,"
3509,59,  such tribute as to winter chill
3510,59,  the lonely redbreast pays!
3511,59," clear, loud, and lively is the din,"
3512,59, from social warblers gathering in
3513,59," their harvest of sweet lays,"
3514,59,
3515,59, nor doth the example fail to cheer
3516,59," me, conscious that my leaf is sere,"
3517,59," and yellow on the bough,-"
3518,59," fall, rosy garlands, from my head!"
3519,59," ye myrtle wreaths, your fragrance shed"
3520,59, around a younger brow!
3521,59,
3522,59, yet will i temperately rejoice;
3523,59," wide is the range, and free the choice"
3524,59, of undiscordant themes;
3525,59," which, haply, kindred souls may prize"
3526,59," not less than vernal ecstasies,"
3527,59," and passion's feverish dreams,"
3528,59,
3529,59," for deathless powers to verse belong,"
3530,59, and they like demi-gods are strong
3531,59, on whom the muses smile;
3532,59," but some their function have disclaimed,"
3533,59, best pleased with what is aptliest framed
3534,59," to enervate and defile,"
3535,59,
3536,59, not such the initiatory strains
3537,59, committed to the silent plains
3538,59," in britain's earliest dawn,"
3539,59," trembled the groves, the stars grew pale,"
3540,59, while all-too-daringly the veil
3541,59, of nature was withdrawn!
3542,59,
3543,59, nor such the spirit-stirring note
3544,59," when the live chords alcæus smote,"
3545,59, inflamed by sense of wrong;
3546,59, woe! woe to tyrants! from the lyre
3547,59," broke threateningly, in sparkles dire"
3548,59," of fierce vindictive song,"
3549,59,
3550,59, and not unhallowed was the page
3551,59," by wingèd love inscribed, to assuage"
3552,59, the pangs of vain pursuit;
3553,59, love listening while the lesbian maid
3554,59, with finest touch of passion swayed
3555,59," her own æolian lute,"
3556,59,
3557,59," o ye, who patiently explore"
3558,59," the wreck of herculanean lore,"
3559,59, what rapture! could ye seize
3560,59," some theban fragment, or unroll"
3561,59," one precious, tender-hearted scroll"
3562,59," of pure simonides,"
3563,59,
3564,59," that were, indeed, a genuine birth"
3565,59, of poesy; a bursting forth
3566,59," of genius from the dust,"
3567,59," what horace gloried to behold,"
3568,59," what maro loved, shall we enfold?"
3569,59, can haughty time be just!
3570,60,",  she was a phantom of delight"
3571,60,   when first she gleamed upon my sight;
3572,60,"   a lovely apparition, sent"
3573,60,   to be a moment's ornament;
3574,60,   her eyes as stars of twilight fair;
3575,60,"   like twilight's, too, her dusky hair;"
3576,60,   but all things else about her drawn
3577,60,   from may-time and the cheerful dawn;
3578,60,"   a dancing shape, an image gay,"
3579,60,"  to haunt, to startle, and way-lay,"
3580,60,"  i saw her upon nearer view,"
3581,60,"  a spirit, yet a woman too!"
3582,60,"  her household motions light and free,"
3583,60,  and steps of virgin-liberty;
3584,60,  a countenance in which did meet
3585,60,"  sweet records, promises as sweet;"
3586,60,  a creature not too bright or good
3587,60,  for human nature's daily food;
3588,60,"  for transient sorrows, simple wiles,"
3589,60,"  praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles,"
3590,60,  and now i see with eye serene
3591,60,  the very pulse of the machine;
3592,60,"  a being breathing thoughtful breath,"
3593,60,  a traveller between life and death;
3594,60,"  the reason firm, the temperate will,"
3595,60,"  endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;"
3596,60,"  a perfect woman, nobly planned,"
3597,60,"  to warn, to comfort, and command;"
3598,60,"  and yet a spirit still, and bright"
3599,60,"  with something of angelic light,"
3600,61,",  with an incident in which he was concerned"
3601,61,"    in the sweet shire of cardigan,"
3602,61,"   not far from pleasant ivor-hall,"
3603,61,"   an old man dwells, a little man,--"
3604,61,"   'tis said he once was tall,"
3605,61,   for five-and-thirty years he lived
3606,61,   a running huntsman merry;
3607,61,   and still the centre of his cheek
3608,61,"   is red as a ripe cherry,"
3609,61,"   no man like him the horn could sound,"
3610,61,  and hill and valley rang with glee
3611,61,"  when echo bandied, round and round"
3612,61,"  the halloo of simon lee,"
3613,61,"  in those proud days, he little cared"
3614,61,  for husbandry or tillage;
3615,61,  to blither tasks did simon rouse
3616,61,"  the sleepers of the village,"
3617,61,
3618,61,"  he all the country could outrun,"
3619,61,  could leave both man and horse behind;
3620,61,"  and often, ere the chase was done,"
3621,61,"  he reeled, and was stone-blind,"
3622,61,  and still there's something in the world
3623,61,  at which his heart rejoices;
3624,61,"  for when the chiming hounds are out,"
3625,61,  he dearly loves their voices!
3626,61,
3627,61,"  but, oh the heavy change!--bereft"
3628,61,"  of health, strength, friends, and kindred, see!"
3629,61,  old simon to the world is left
3630,61,"  in liveried poverty,"
3631,61,  his master's dead--and no one now
3632,61,  dwells in the hall of ivor;
3633,61,"  men, dogs, and horses, all are dead;"
3634,61,"  he is the sole survivor,"
3635,61,
3636,61,  and he is lean and he is sick;
3637,61,"  his body, dwindled and awry,"
3638,61,  rests upon ankles swoln and thick;
3639,61,"  his legs are thin and dry,"
3640,61,"  one prop he has, and only one,"
3641,61,"  his wife, an aged woman,"
3642,61,"  lives with him, near the waterfall,"
3643,61,"  upon the village common,"
3644,61,
3645,61,"  beside their moss-grown hut of clay,"
3646,61,"  not twenty paces from the door,"
3647,61,"  a scrap of land they have, but they"
3648,61,"  are poorest of the poor,"
3649,61,  this scrap of land he from the heath
3650,61,  enclosed when he was stronger;
3651,61,  but what to them avails the land
3652,61,  which he can till no longer?
3653,61,
3654,61,"  oft, working by her husband's side,"
3655,61,  ruth does what simon cannot do;
3656,61,"  for she, with scanty cause for pride,"
3657,61,"  is stouter of the two,"
3658,61,"  and, though you with your utmost skill"
3659,61,"  from labour could not wean them,"
3660,61,"  'tis little, very little--all"
3661,61,"  that they can do between them,"
3662,61,
3663,61,  few months of life has he in store
3664,61,"  as he to you will tell,"
3665,61,"  for still, the more he works, the more"
3666,61,"   do his weak ankles swell,"
3667,61,"  my gentle reader, i perceive,"
3668,61,"  how patiently you've waited,"
3669,61,  and now i fear that you expect
3670,61,"  some tale will be related,"
3671,61,
3672,61,  o reader! had you in your mind
3673,61,"  such stores as silent thought can bring,"
3674,61,  o gentle reader! you would find
3675,61,"  a tale in every thing,"
3676,61,"  what more i have to say is short,"
3677,61,"  and you must kindly take it,"
3678,61,"  it is no tale; but, should you think,"
3679,61,"  perhaps a tale you'll make it,"
3680,61,
3681,61,  one summer-day i chanced to see
3682,61,  this old man doing all he could
3683,61,"  to unearth the root of an old tree,"
3684,61,"  a stump of rotten wood,"
3685,61,  the mattock tottered in his hand;
3686,61,"  so vain was his endeavour,"
3687,61,  that at the root of the old tree
3688,61,"  he might have worked for ever,"
3689,61,
3690,61,"  you're overtasked, good simon lee,"
3691,61,"  give me your tool, to him i said;"
3692,61,  and at the word right gladly he
3693,61,"  received my proffered aid,"
3694,61,"  i struck, and with a single blow"
3695,61,"  the tangled root i severed,"
3696,61,  at which the poor old man so long
3697,61,"  and vainly had endeavoured,"
3698,61,
3699,61,"  the tears into his eyes were brought,"
3700,61,  and thanks and praises seemed to run
3701,61,"  so fast out of his heart, i thought"
3702,61,"  they never would have done,"
3703,61,"  --i've heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds"
3704,61,  with coldness still returning;
3705,61,  alas! the gratitude of men
3706,61,"  hath oftener left me mourning,"
3707,62,",       high in the breathless hall the minstrel sate,"
3708,62,"   and emont's murmur mingled with the song,--"
3709,62,"   the words of ancient time i thus translate,"
3710,62,"   a festal strain that hath been silent long,--"
3711,62,"       from town to town, from tower to tower,"
3712,62,"       the red rose is a gladsome flower,"
3713,62,"       her thirty years of winter past,"
3714,62,       the red rose is revived at last;
3715,62,"       she lifts her head for endless spring,"
3716,62,"      for everlasting blossoming,"
3717,62,"      both roses flourish, red and white,"
3718,62,      in love and sisterly delight
3719,62,"      the two that were at strife are blended,"
3720,62,"      and all old troubles now are ended,--"
3721,62,      joy! joy to both! but most to her
3722,62,      who is the flower of lancaster!
3723,62,      behold her how she smiles to-day
3724,62,"      on this great throng, this bright array!"
3725,62,      fair greeting doth she send to all
3726,62,      from every corner of the hall;
3727,62,      but chiefly from above the board
3728,62,"      where sits in state our rightful lord,"
3729,62,      a clifford to his own restored!
3730,62,
3731,62,"         they came with banner, spear, and shield;"
3732,62,"      and it was proved in bosworth-field,"
3733,62,      not long the avenger was withstood--
3734,62,"      earth helped him with the cry of blood,"
3735,62,"      st, george was for us, and the might"
3736,62,"      of blessed angels crowned the right,"
3737,62,"      loud voice the land has uttered forth,"
3738,62,"      we loudest in the faithful north,"
3739,62,"      our fields rejoice, our mountains ring,"
3740,62,      our streams proclaim a welcoming;
3741,62,      our strong-abodes and castles see
3742,62,"      the glory of their loyalty,"
3743,62,
3744,62,         how glad is skipton at this hour--
3745,62,"      though lonely, a deserted tower;"
3746,62,"      knight, squire, and yeoman, page and groom,"
3747,62,"      we have them at the feast of brough'm,"
3748,62,      how glad pendragon--though the sleep
3749,62,      of years be on her!--she shall reap
3750,62,"      a taste of this great pleasure, viewing"
3751,62,"      as in a dream her own renewing,"
3752,62,"      rejoiced is brough, right glad, i deem,"
3753,62,      beside her little humble stream;
3754,62,      and she that keepeth watch and ward
3755,62,      her statelier eden's course to guard;
3756,62,"      they both are happy at this hour,"
3757,62,"      though each is but a lonely tower,--"
3758,62,      but here is perfect joy and pride
3759,62,"      for one fair house by emont's side,"
3760,62,"      this day, distinguished without peer,"
3761,62,      to see her master and to cheer--
3762,62,"      him, and his lady-mother dear!"
3763,62,
3764,62,         oh! it was a time forlorn
3765,62,      when the fatherless was born--
3766,62,"      give her wings that she may fly,"
3767,62,      or she sees her infant die!
3768,62,      swords that are with slaughter wild
3769,62,"       hunt the mother and the child,"
3770,62,      who will take them from the light?
3771,62,      --yonder is a man in sight--
3772,62,      yonder is a house--but where?
3773,62,"      no, they must not enter there,"
3774,62,"      to the caves, and to the brooks,"
3775,62,      to the clouds of heaven she looks;
3776,62,"      she is speechless, but her eyes"
3777,62,"      pray in ghostly agonies,"
3778,62,"      blissful mary, mother mild,"
3779,62,"      maid and mother undefiled,"
3780,62,      save a mother and her child!
3781,62,
3782,62,         now who is he that bounds with joy
3783,62,"      on carrock's side, a shepherd-boy?"
3784,62,      no thoughts hath he but thoughts that pass
3785,62,"      light as the wind along the grass,"
3786,62,      can this be he who hither came
3787,62,"      in secret, like a smothered flame?"
3788,62,      o'er whom such thankful tears were shed
3789,62,"      for shelter, and a poor man's bread!"
3790,62,      god loves the child; and god hath willed
3791,62,"      that those dear words should be fulfilled,"
3792,62,"      the lady's words, when forced away"
3793,62,"      the last she to her babe did say,"
3794,62,"      my own, my own, thy fellow-guest"
3795,62,"      i may not be; but rest thee, rest,"
3796,62,      for lowly shepherd's life is best!
3797,62,
3798,62,         alas! when evil men are strong
3799,62,"      no life is good, no pleasure long,"
3800,62,"      the boy must part from mosedale's groves,"
3801,62,"      and leave blencathara's rugged coves,"
3802,62,      and quit the flowers that summer brings
3803,62,      to glenderamakin's lofty springs;
3804,62,"      must vanish, and his careless cheer"
3805,62,"      be turned to heaviness and fear,"
3806,62,      --give sir lancelot threlkeld praise!
3807,62,"      hear it, good man, old in days!"
3808,62,      thou tree of covert and of rest
3809,62,      for this young bird that is distrest;
3810,62,"      among thy branches safe he lay,"
3811,62,"    and he was free to sport and play,"
3812,62,"    when falcons were abroad for prey,"
3813,62,
3814,62,"       a recreant harp, that sings of fear"
3815,62,    and heaviness in clifford's ear!
3816,62,"    i said, when evil men are strong,"
3817,62,"    no life is good, no pleasure long,"
3818,62,    a weak and cowardly untruth!
3819,62,"    our clifford was a happy youth,"
3820,62,"    and thankful through a weary time,"
3821,62,"    that brought him up to manhood's prime,"
3822,62,"    --again he wanders forth at will,"
3823,62,"    and tends a flock from hill to hill,"
3824,62,    his garb is humble; ne'er was seen
3825,62,    such garb with such a noble mien;
3826,62,    among the shepherd-grooms no mate
3827,62,"    hath he, a child of strength and state!"
3828,62,"    yet lacks not friends for simple glee,"
3829,62,"    nor yet for higher sympathy,"
3830,62,
3831,62,    to his side the fallow-deer
3832,62,    came and rested without fear;
3833,62,"    the eagle, lord of land and sea,"
3834,62,    stooped down to pay him fealty;
3835,62,    and both the undying fish that swim
3836,62,    through bowscale-tarn did wait on him;
3837,62,    the pair were servants of his eye
3838,62,    in their immortality;
3839,62,"    and glancing, gleaming, dark or bright,"
3840,62,"    moved to and fro, for his delight,"
3841,62,    he knew the rocks which angels haunt
3842,62,    upon the mountains visitant;
3843,62,"    he hath kenned them taking wing,"
3844,62,    and into caves where faeries sing
3845,62,    he hath entered; and been told
3846,62,"    by voices how men lived of old,"
3847,62,    among the heavens his eye can see
3848,62,    the face of thing that is to be;
3849,62,"    and, if that men report him right,"
3850,62,"    his tongue could whisper words of might,"
3851,62,"    --now another day is come,"
3852,62,"    fitter hope, and nobler doom;"
3853,62,"    he hath thrown aside his crook,"
3854,62,    and hath buried deep his book;
3855,62,    armour rusting in his halls
3856,62,"    on the blood of clifford calls,--"
3857,62,"    'quell the scot,' exclaims the lance--"
3858,62,"    bear me to the heart of france,"
3859,62,    is the longing of the shield--
3860,62,"    tell thy name, thou trembling field;"
3861,62,"    field of death, where'er thou be,"
3862,62,    groan thou with our victory!
3863,62,"    happy day, and mighty hour,"
3864,62,"    when our shepherd, in his power,"
3865,62,"    mailed and horsed, with lance and sword,"
3866,62,    to his ancestors restored
3867,62,"    like a re-appearing star,"
3868,62,    like a glory from afar
3869,62,    first shall head the flock of war!
3870,62,
3871,62, alas! the impassioned minstrel did not know
3872,62," how, by heaven's grace, this clifford's heart was framed,"
3873,62," how he, long forced in humble walks to go,"
3874,62," was softened into feeling, soothed, and tamed,"
3875,62,
3876,62, love had he found in huts where poor men lie;
3877,62," his daily teachers had been woods and rills,"
3878,62," the silence that is in the starry sky,"
3879,62," the sleep that is among the lonely hills,"
3880,62,
3881,62," in him the savage virtue of the race,"
3882,62," revenge and all ferocious thoughts were dead,"
3883,62, nor did he change; but kept in lofty place
3884,62," the wisdom which adversity had bred,"
3885,62,
3886,62," glad were the vales, and every cottage-hearth;"
3887,62, the shepherd-lord was honoured more and more;
3888,62," and, ages after he was laid in earth,"
3889,62," the good lord clifford was the name he bore,"
3890,63,once i could hail howe'er serene the sky
3891,63,"the moon re-entering her monthly round,"
3892,63,no faculty yet given me to espy
3893,63,"the dusky shape within her arms imbound,"
3894,63,that thin memento of effulgence lost
3895,63,"which some have named her predecessor's ghost, ,"
3896,63,
3897,63,"young, like the crescent that above me shone,"
3898,63,nought i perceived within it dull or dim;
3899,63,all that appeared was suitable to one
3900,63,whose fancy had a thousand fields to skim;
3901,63,"to expectations spreading with wild growth,"
3902,63,"and hope that kept with me her plighted troth,"
3903,63,
3904,63,i saw ambition quickening at the view
3905,63,a silver boat launched on a boundless flood;
3906,63,"a pearly crest, like dian's when it threw"
3907,63,its brightest splendor round a leafy wood;
3908,63,"but not a hint from under-ground, no sign"
3909,63,"fit for the glimmering brow of proserpine,"
3910,63,
3911,63,or was it dian's self that seemed to move
3912,63,before me ?---nothing blemished the fair sight;
3913,63,"on her i looked whom jocund fairies love,"
3914,63,"cynthia, who puts the little stars to flight,"
3915,63,"and by that thinning magnifies the great,"
3916,63,"for exaltation of her sovereign state,"
3917,63,
3918,63,and when i learned to mark the spectral shape
3919,63,"as each new moon obeyed the call of time,"
3920,63,"if gloom fell on me, swift was my escape;"
3921,63,"such happy privilege hath life's gay prime,"
3922,63,"to see or not to see, as best may please"
3923,63,"a buoyant spirit, and a heart at ease,"
3924,63,
3925,63,"now, dazzling stranger! when thou meet'st my glance,"
3926,63,thy dark associate ever i discern;
3927,63,emblem of thought too eager to advance
3928,63,"while i salute my joys, thoughts sad or stern;"
3929,63,"shades of past bliss, or phantoms that, to gain"
3930,63,"their fill of promised lustre, wait in vain,"
3931,63,
3932,63,so changes mortal life with fleeting years;
3933,63,"a mournful change, should reason fail to bring"
3934,63,"the timely insight that can temper fears,"
3935,63,and from vicissitude remove its sting;
3936,63,while faith aspires to seats in that domain
3937,63,"where joys are perfect---neither wax nor wane,"
3938,64,"what, you are stepping westward?--yea,"
3939,64,
3940,64,"---'t would be a wildish destiny,"
3941,64,"if we, who thus together roam"
3942,64,"in a strange land, and far from home,"
3943,64,"were in this place the guests of chance,"
3944,64,"yet who would stop, or fear to advance,"
3945,64,"though home or shelter he had none,"
3946,64,with such a sky to lead him on?
3947,64,
3948,64,the dewy ground was dark and cold;
3949,64,"behind, all gloomy to behold;"
3950,64,and stepping westward seemed to be
3951,64,"a kind of heavenly destiny,"
3952,64,i liked the greeting; 't was a sound
3953,64,of something without place or bound;
3954,64,and seemed to give me spiritual right
3955,64,"to travel through that region bright,"
3956,64,
3957,64,"the voice was soft, and she who spake"
3958,64,"was walking by her native lake,"
3959,64,the salutation had to me
3960,64,"the very sound of courtesy,"
3961,64,its power was felt; and while my eye
3962,64,"was fixed upon the glowing sky,"
3963,64,the echo of the voice enwrought
3964,64,a human sweetness with the thought
3965,64,of travelling through the world that lay
3966,64,"before me in my endless way,"
3967,65,surprised by joy-impatient as the wind
3968,65,i turned to share the transport-oh! with whom
3969,65,"but thee, deep buried in the silent tomb,"
3970,65,that spot which no vicissitude can find?
3971,65,"love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind-"
3972,65,"but how could i forget thee? through what power,"
3973,65,"even for the least division of an hour,"
3974,65,have i been so beguiled as to be blind
3975,65,to my most grievous loss!-that thought's return
3976,65,"was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,"
3977,65,"save one, one only, when i stood forlorn,"
3978,65,knowing my heart's best treasure was no more;
3979,65,"that neither present time, nor years unborn"
3980,65,"could to my sight that heavenly face restore,"
3981,66,i wandered lonely as a cloud
3982,66," that floats on high o'er vales and hills,"
3983,66,"when all at once i saw a crowd,"
3984,66," a host, of golden daffodils;"
3985,66,"beside the lake, beneath the trees,"
3986,66,"fluttering and dancing in the breeze,"
3987,66,
3988,66,continuous as the stars that shine
3989,66," and twinkle on the milky way,"
3990,66,they stretched in never-ending line
3991,66," along the margin of a bay,"
3992,66,"the thousand saw i at a glance,"
3993,66,"tossing their heads in sprightly dance,"
3994,66,
3995,66,the waves beside them danced; but they
3996,66," outdid the sparkling waves in glee,"
3997,66,"a poet could not but be gay,"
3998,66," in sich a jocund company,"
3999,66,i gazed--and gazed--but little thought
4000,66,"what wealth the show to me had brought,"
4001,66,
4002,66,"for oft, when on my couch i lie"
4003,66," in vacant or in pensive mood,"
4004,66,the flash upon that inward wye
4005,66, which is the bliss of solitude;
4006,66,"and then my heart with pleasure fills,"
4007,66,"and dances with the daffodils,"
4008,67,the peace which other seek they find;
4009,67,the heaviest storms not longest last;
4010,67,heaven grants even to the guiltiest mind
4011,67,an amnesty for what is past;
4012,67,when will my sentence be reversed?
4013,67,i only pray to know the worst;
4014,67,"and wish as if my heart would burst,"
4015,67,
4016,67,o weary struggle! silent year
4017,67,tell seemingly no doubtful tale;
4018,67,"and yet they leave it short, and fear"
4019,67,"and hopes are strong and will prevail,"
4020,67,my calmest faith escapes not pain;
4021,67,"and, feeling that the hope in vain,"
4022,67,"i think that he will come again,"
4023,68,a conversation
4024,68,
4025,68,"we talked with open heart, and tongue"
4026,68,"affectionate and true,"
4027,68,"a pair of friends, though i was young,"
4028,68,"and matthew seventy-two,"
4029,68,
4030,68,"we lay beneath a spreading oak,"
4031,68,beside a mossy seat;
4032,68,and from the turf a fountain broke
4033,68,"and gurgled at our feet,"
4034,68,
4035,68,"`now, matthew!' said i, `let us match"
4036,68,this water's pleasant tune
4037,68,"with some old border-song, or catch"
4038,68,that suits a summer's noon;
4039,68,
4040,68,`or of the church-clock and the chimes
4041,68,sing here beneath the shade
4042,68,that half-mad thing of witty rhymes
4043,68,which you last april made!'
4044,68,
4045,68,"in silence matthew lay, and eyed"
4046,68,the spring beneath the tree;
4047,68,"and thus the dear old man replied,"
4048,68,"the grey-haired man of glee,"
4049,68,
4050,68,"`no check, no stay, this streamlet fears,"
4051,68,how merrily it goes!
4052,68,'twill murmur on a thousand years
4053,68,"and flow as now it flows,"
4054,68,
4055,68,"`and here, on this delightful day,"
4056,68,i cannot choose but think
4057,68,"how oft, a vigorous man, i lay"
4058,68,"beside this fountain's brink,"
4059,68,
4060,68,"`my eyes are dim with childish tears,"
4061,68,"my heart is idly stirred,"
4062,68,for the same sound is in my ears
4063,68,"which in those days i heard,"
4064,68,
4065,68,"`thus fares it still in our decay,"
4066,68,and yet the wiser mind
4067,68,"mourns less for what age takes away,"
4068,68,"than what it leaves behind,"
4069,68,
4070,68,"`the blackbird amid leafy trees,"
4071,68,"the lark above the hill,"
4072,68,"let loose their carols when they please,"
4073,68,"are quiet when they will,"
4074,68,
4075,68,`with nature never do they wage
4076,68,a foolish strife; they see
4077,68,"a happy youth, and their old age"
4078,68,"is beautiful and free,"
4079,68,
4080,68,`but we are pressed by heavy laws;
4081,68,"and often, glad no more,"
4082,68,"we wear a face of joy, because"
4083,68,"we have been glad of yore,"
4084,68,
4085,68,`if there be one who need bemoan
4086,68,"his kindred laid in earth,"
4087,68,"the household hearts that were his own, -"
4088,68,"it is the man of mirth,"
4089,68,
4090,68,"`my days, my friend, are almost gone,"
4091,68,"my life has been approved,"
4092,68,and many love me; but by none
4093,68,"am i enough beloved,'"
4094,68,
4095,68,"`now both himself and me he wrongs,"
4096,68,the man who thus complains!
4097,68,i live and sing my idle songs
4098,68,"upon these happy plains,"
4099,68,
4100,68,"`and, matthew, for thy children dead"
4101,68,i'll be a son to thee!'
4102,68,at this he grasped my hand and said
4103,68,"`alas! that cannot be,'"
4104,68,
4105,68,we rose up from the fountain-side;
4106,68,and down the smooth descent
4107,68,of the green sheep-track did we glide;
4108,68,and through the wood we went;
4109,68,
4110,68,and ere we came to leonard's rock
4111,68,he sang those witty rhymes
4112,68,"about the crazy old church-clock,"
4113,68,"and the bewildered chimes,"
4114,69,",   oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy!"
4115,69,   for mighty were the auxiliars which then stood
4116,69,"   upon our side, we who were strong in love!"
4117,69,"   bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,"
4118,69,"   but to be young was very heaven!--oh! times,"
4119,69,"   in which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways"
4120,69,"   of custom, law, and statute, took at once"
4121,69,   the attraction of a country in romance!
4122,69,"   when reason seemed the most to assert her rights,"
4123,69,  when most intent on making of herself
4124,69,  a prime enchantress--to assist the work
4125,69,  which then was going forward in her name!
4126,69,"  not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth,"
4127,69,"  the beauty wore of promise, that which sets"
4128,69,  as at some moment might not be unfelt
4129,69,  among the bowers of paradise itself 
4130,69,"  the budding rose above the rose full blown,"
4131,69,  what temper at the prospect did not wake
4132,69,  to happiness unthought of? the inert
4133,69,"  were roused, and lively natures rapt away!"
4134,69,"  they who had fed their childhood upon dreams,"
4135,69,"  the playfellows of fancy, who had made"
4136,69,"  all powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength"
4137,69,"  their ministers,--who in lordly wise had stirred"
4138,69,"  among the grandest objects of the sense,"
4139,69,  and dealt with whatsoever they found there
4140,69,  as if they had within some lurking right
4141,69,"  to wield it;--they, too, who, of gentle mood,"
4142,69,"  had watched all gentle motions, and to these"
4143,69,"  had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more wild,"
4144,69,  and in the region of their peaceful selves;--
4145,69,"  now was it that both found, the meek and lofty"
4146,69,"  did both find, helpers to their heart's desire,"
4147,69,"  and stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish;"
4148,69,"  wcre called upon to exercise their skill,"
4149,69,"  not in utopia, subterranean fields,"
4150,69,"  or some secreted island, heaven knows where!"
4151,69,"  but in the very world, which is the world"
4152,69,"  of all of us,--the place where in the end"
4153,69,"  we find our happiness, or not at all!"
4154,70,beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed
4155,70,"their snow-white blossoms on my head,"
4156,70,with brightest sunshine round me spread
4157,70,"      of spring's unclouded weather,"
4158,70,in this sequestered nook how sweet
4159,70,to sit upon my orchard-seat!
4160,70,"and birds and flowers once more to greet,"
4161,70,"      my last year's friends together,"
4162,70,
4163,70,"one have i marked, the happiest guest"
4164,70,"in all this covert of the blest,"
4165,70,"hail to thee, far above the rest"
4166,70,      in joy of voice and pinion!
4167,70,"thou, linnet! in thy green array,"
4168,70,"presiding spirit here today,"
4169,70,dost lead the revels of the may;
4170,70,"      and this is thy dominion,"
4171,70,
4172,70,"while bird, and butterflies, and flowers,"
4173,70,"make all one band of paramours,"
4174,70,"thou, ranging up and down the bowers,"
4175,70,"      art sole in thy employment,"
4176,70,"a life, a presence like the air,"
4177,70,"scattering thy gladness without care,"
4178,70,too blest with any one to pair;
4179,70,"      thyself thy own enjoyment,"
4180,70,
4181,70,"amid yon tuft of hazel trees,"
4182,70,"that twinkle to the gusty breeze,"
4183,70,"behold him perched in ecstasies,"
4184,70,      yet seeming still to hover;
4185,70,there! where the flutter of his wings
4186,70,upon his back and body flings
4187,70,"shadows and sunny glimmerings,"
4188,70,"      that cover him all over,"
4189,70,
4190,70,"my dazzled sight he oft deceives,"
4191,70,a brother of the dancing leaves;
4192,70,"then flits, and from the cottage eaves"
4193,70,      pours forth his song in gushes;
4194,70,as if by that exulting strain
4195,70,he mocked and treated with disdain
4196,70,"the voiceless form he chose to feign,"
4197,70,"      while fluttering in the bushes,"
4198,71,the valley rings with mirth and joy;
4199,71,among the hills the echoes play
4200,71,"a never never ending song,"
4201,71,"to welcome in the may,"
4202,71,the magpie chatters with delight;
4203,71,the mountain raven's youngling brood
4204,71,have left the mother and the nest;
4205,71,and they go rambling east and west
4206,71,in search of their own food;
4207,71,or through the glittering vapors dart
4208,71,"in very wantonness of heart,"
4209,71,
4210,71,"beneath a rock, upon the grass,"
4211,71,two boys are sitting in the sun;
4212,71,"their work, if any work they have,"
4213,71,"is out of mind---or done,"
4214,71,on pipes of sycamore they play
4215,71,the fragments of a christmas hymn;
4216,71,or with that plant which in our dale
4217,71,"we call stag-horn, or fox's tail,"
4218,71,"their rusty hats they trim,"
4219,71,"and thus, as happy as the day,"
4220,71,"those shepherds wear the time away,"
4221,71,
4222,71,along the river's stony marge
4223,71,the sand-lark chants a joyous song;
4224,71,"the thrush is busy in the wood,"
4225,71,"and carols loud and strong,"
4226,71,"a thousand lambs are on the rocks,"
4227,71,all newly born! both earth and sky
4228,71,"keep jubilee, and more than all,"
4229,71,those boys with their green coronal;
4230,71,"they never hear the cry,"
4231,71,that plaintive cry! which up the hill
4232,71,"comes from the depth of dungeon-ghyll,"
4233,71,
4234,71,"said walter, leaping from the ground,"
4235,71,down to the stump of yon old yew
4236,71,"we'll for our whistles run a race,"
4237,71,away the shepherds flew;
4238,71,they leapt---they ran---and when they came
4239,71,"right opposite to dungeon-ghyll,"
4240,71,"seeing that he should lose the prize,"
4241,71,stop!  to his comrade walter cries---
4242,71,"james stopped with no good will,"
4243,71,"said walter then, exulting; here"
4244,71,"you'll find a task for half a year,"
4245,71,
4246,71,"cross, if you dare, where i shall cross---"
4247,71,"come on, and tread where i shall tread,"
4248,71,"the other took him at his word,"
4249,71,"and followed as he led,"
4250,71,it was a spot which you may see
4251,71,if ever you to langdale go;
4252,71,into a chasm a mighty block
4253,71,"hath fallen, and made a bridge of rock,"
4254,71,the gulf is deep below;
4255,71,"and, in a basin black and small,"
4256,71,"receives a lofty waterfall,"
4257,71,
4258,71,with staff in hand across the cleft
4259,71,the challenger pursued his march;
4260,71,"and now, all eyes and feet, hath gained"
4261,71,"the middle of the arch,"
4262,71,when list! he hears a piteous moan---
4263,71,again !---his heart within him dies---
4264,71,"his pulse is stopped, his breath is lost,"
4265,71,"he totters, pallid as a ghost,"
4266,71,"and, looking down, espies"
4267,71,"a lamb, that in the pool is pent"
4268,71,"within that black and frightful rent,"
4269,71,
4270,71,"the lamb had slipped into the stream,"
4271,71,and safe without a bruise or wound
4272,71,the cataract had borne him down
4273,71,"into the gulf profound,"
4274,71,"his dam had seen him when he fell,"
4275,71,she saw him down the torrent borne;
4276,71,"and, while with all a mother's love"
4277,71,she from the lofty rocks above
4278,71,"sent forth a cry forlorn,"
4279,71,"the lamb, still swimming round and round,"
4280,71,"made answer to that plaintive sound,"
4281,71,
4282,71,"when he had learnt what thing it was,"
4283,71,that sent this rueful cry; i ween
4284,71,"the boy recovered heart, and told"
4285,71,"the sight which he had seen,"
4286,71,both gladly now deferred their task;
4287,71,nor was there wanting other aid---
4288,71,"a poet, one who loves the brooks"
4289,71,"far better than the sages' books,"
4290,71,by chance had thither strayed;
4291,71,and there the helpless lamb he found
4292,71,"by those huge rocks encompassed round,"
4293,71,
4294,71,"he drew it from the troubled pool,"
4295,71,"and brought it forth into the light,"
4296,71,"the shepherds met him with his charge,"
4297,71,an unexpected sight!
4298,71,"into their arms the lamb they took,"
4299,71,whose life and limbs the flood had spared;
4300,71,"then up the steep ascent they hied,"
4301,71,and placed him at his mother's side;
4302,71,and gently did the bard
4303,71,"those idle shepherd-boys upbraid,"
4304,71,"and bade them better mind their trade,"
4305,72,"that way look, my infant, lo!"
4306,72,what a pretty baby-show!
4307,72,"see the kitten on the wall,"
4308,72,"sporting with the leaves that fall,"
4309,72,withered leaves---one---two---and three---
4310,72,from the lofty elder-tree!
4311,72,through the calm and frosty air
4312,72,"of this morning bright and fair,"
4313,72,eddying round and round they sink
4314,72,"softly, slowly, one might think,"
4315,72,"from the motions that are made,"
4316,72,every little leaf conveyed
4317,72,"sylph or faery hither tending,---"
4318,72,"to this lower world descending,"
4319,72,"each invisible and mute,"
4320,72,"in his wavering parachute,"
4321,72,"---but the kitten, how she starts,"
4322,72,"crouches, stretches, paws, and darts!"
4323,72,"first at one, and then its fellow"
4324,72,just as light and just as yellow;
4325,72,there are many now---now one---
4326,72,now they stop and there are none
4327,72,what intenseness of desire
4328,72,in her upward eye of fire!
4329,72,with a tiger-leap half way
4330,72,"now she meets the coming prey,"
4331,72,"lets it go as fast, and then"
4332,72,"has it in her power again,"
4333,72,"now she works with three or four,"
4334,72,like an indian conjurer;
4335,72,"quick as he in feats of art,"
4336,72,"far beyond in joy of heart,"
4337,72,were her antics played in the eye
4338,72,"of a thousand standers-by,"
4339,72,"clapping hands with shout and stare,"
4340,72,what would little tabby care
4341,72,for the plaudits of the crowd?
4342,72,"over happy to be proud,"
4343,72,over wealthy in the treasure
4344,72,of her own exceeding pleasure!
4345,72,     'tis a pretty baby-treat;
4346,72,"nor, i deem, for me unmeet;"
4347,72,"here, for neither babe nor me,"
4348,72,"other play-mate can i see,"
4349,72,"of the countless living things,"
4350,72,that with stir of feet and wings
4351,72,"in the sun or under shade,"
4352,72,upon bough or grassy blade
4353,72,"and with busy revellings,"
4354,72,"chirp and song, and murmurings,"
4355,72,"made this orchard's narrow space,"
4356,72,and this vale so blithe a place;
4357,72,multitudes are swept away
4358,72,"never more to breathe the day,"
4359,72,some are sleeping; some in bands
4360,72,travelled into distant lands;
4361,72,"others slunk to moor and wood,"
4362,72,far from human neighborhood;
4363,72,"and, among the kinds that keep"
4364,72,"with us closer fellowship,"
4365,72,"with us openly abide,"
4366,72,"all have laid their mirth aside,"
4367,72,"     where is he that giddy sprite,"
4368,72,"blue-cap, with his colors bright,"
4369,72,"who was blest as bird could be,"
4370,72,feeding in the apple-tree;
4371,72,"made such wanton spoil and rout,"
4372,72,turning blossoms inside out;
4373,72,hung---head pointing towards the ground---
4374,72,"fluttered, perched, into a round"
4375,72,"bound himself, and then unbound;"
4376,72,"lithest, gaudiest harlequin!"
4377,72,prettiest tumbler ever seen!
4378,72,light of heart and light of limb;
4379,72,what is now become of him?
4380,72,"lambs, that through the mountains went"
4381,72,"frisking, bleating merriment,"
4382,72,"when the year was in its prime,"
4383,72,"they are sobered by this time,"
4384,72,"if you look to vale or hill,"
4385,72,"if you listen, all is still,"
4386,72,"save a little neighboring rill,"
4387,72,that from out the rocky ground
4388,72,"strikes a solitary sound,"
4389,72,"vainly glitter hill and plain,"
4390,72,and the air is calm in vain;
4391,72,vainly morning spreads the lure
4392,72,of a sky serene and pure;
4393,72,creature none can she decoy
4394,72,"into open sign of joy,"
4395,72,is it that they have a fear
4396,72,of the dreary season near?
4397,72,or that other pleasures be
4398,72,sweeter even than gaiety ?
4399,72,"     yet, whate'er enjoyments dwell"
4400,72,in the impenetrable cell
4401,72,of the silent heart which nature
4402,72,furnishes to every creature;
4403,72,whatsoe'er we feel and know
4404,72,"too sedate for outward show,"
4405,72,"such a light of gladness breaks,"
4406,72,"pretty kitten! from thy freaks,---"
4407,72,spreads with such a living grace
4408,72,o'er my little dora's face;
4409,72,"yes, the sight so stirs and charms"
4410,72,"thee, baby, laughing in my arms,"
4411,72,that almost i could repine
4412,72,"that your transports are not mine,"
4413,72,that i do not wholly fare
4414,72,"even as ye do, thoughtless pair!"
4415,72,and i will have my careless season
4416,72,"spite of melancholy reason,"
4417,72,will walk through life in such a way
4418,72,"that, when time brings on decay,"
4419,72,now and then i may possess
4420,72,"hours of perfect gladsomeness,"
4421,72,---pleased by any random toy;
4422,72,"by a kitten's busy joy,"
4423,72,or an infant's laughing eye
4424,72,sharing in the ecstasy;
4425,72,"i would fare like that or this,"
4426,72,find my wisdom in my bliss;
4427,72,"keep the sprightly soul awake,"
4428,72,"and have faculties to take,"
4429,72,"even from things by sorrow wrought,"
4430,72,"matter for a jocund thought,"
4431,72,"spite of care, and spite of grief,"
4432,72,"to gambol with life's falling leaf,"
4433,73,"let us quit the leafy arbor,"
4434,73,and the torrent murmuring by;
4435,73,"for the sun is in his harbor,"
4436,73,"weary of the open sky,"
4437,73,
4438,73,evening now unbinds the fetters
4439,73,fashioned by the glowing light;
4440,73,all that breathe are thankful debtors
4441,73,"to the harbinger of night,"
4442,73,
4443,73,yet by some grave thoughts attended
4444,73,eve renews her calm career;
4445,73,"for the day that now is ended,"
4446,73,"is the longest of the year,"
4447,73,
4448,73,"dora! sport, as now thou sportest,"
4449,73,"on this platform, light and free;"
4450,73,"take thy bliss, while longest, shortest,"
4451,73,are indifferent to thee!
4452,73,
4453,73,who would check the happy feeling
4454,73,that inspires the linnet's song?
4455,73,"who would stop the swallow, wheeling"
4456,73,on her pinions swift and strong?
4457,73,
4458,73,"yet at this impressive season,"
4459,73,words which tenderness can speak
4460,73,"from the truths of homely reason,"
4461,73,might exalt the loveliest cheek;
4462,73,
4463,73,"and, while shades to shades succeeding"
4464,73,"steal the landscape from the sight,"
4465,73,"i would urge this moral pleading,"
4466,73,last forerunner of good night!
4467,73,
4468,73,summer ebbs; -- each day that follows
4469,73,"is a reflux from on high,"
4470,73,tending to the darksome hollows
4471,73,"where the frosts of winter lie,"
4472,73,
4473,73,"he who governs the creation,"
4474,73,"in his providence, assigned"
4475,73,such a gradual declination
4476,73,"to the life of human kind,"
4477,73,
4478,73,"yet we mark it not; -- fruits redden,"
4479,73,"fresh flowers blow, as flowers have blown,"
4480,73,and the heart is loth to deaden
4481,73,"hopes that she so long hath known,"
4482,73,
4483,73,"be thou wiser, youthful maiden!"
4484,73,"and when thy decline shall come,"
4485,73,"let not dowers, or boughs fruit-laden,"
4486,73,"hide the knowledge of thy doom,"
4487,73,
4488,73,"now, even now, ere wrapped in slumber,"
4489,73,fix thine eyes upon the sea
4490,73,"that absorbs time, space, and number;"
4491,73,look thou to eternity!
4492,73,
4493,73,follow thou the flowing river
4494,73,on whose breast are thither borne
4495,73,"all deceived, and each deceiver,"
4496,73,through the gates of night and morn;
4497,73,
4498,73,through the year's successive portals;
4499,73,through the bounds which many a star
4500,73,"marks, not mindless of frail mortals,"
4501,73,"when his light returns from far,"
4502,73,
4503,73,thus when thou with time hast travelled
4504,73,"toward the mighty gulf of things,"
4505,73,and the mazy stream unravelled
4506,73,with thy best imaginings;
4507,73,
4508,73,"think, if thou on beauty leanest,"
4509,73,"think how pitiful that stay,"
4510,73,did not virtue give the meanest
4511,73,"charms superior to decay,"
4512,73,
4513,73,"duty, like a strict preceptor,"
4514,73,"sometimes frowns, or seems to frown;"
4515,73,"choose her thistle for thy sceptre,"
4516,73,"while youth's roses are thy crown,"
4517,73,
4518,73,"grasp it, -- if thou shrink and tremble,"
4519,73,"fairest damsel of the green,"
4520,73,thou wilt lack the only symbol
4521,73,that proclaims a genuine queen;
4522,73,
4523,73,and ensures those palms of honor
4524,73,"which selected spirits wear,"
4525,73,"bending low before the donor,"
4526,73,lord of heaven's unchanging year!
4527,74,"a month, sweet little-ones, is past"
4528,74,"since your dear mother went away,---"
4529,74,and she tomorrow will return;
4530,74,"tomorrow is the happy day,"
4531,74,
4532,74,o blessed tidings! thought of joy!
4533,74,the eldest heard with steady glee;
4534,74,"silent he stood; then laughed amain,---"
4535,74,"and shouted,  mother, come to me!"
4536,74,
4537,74,"louder and louder did he shout,"
4538,74,with witless hope to bring her near;
4539,74,"nay, patience! patience, little boy!"
4540,74,"your tender mother cannot hear,"
4541,74,
4542,74,"i told of hills, and far-off town,"
4543,74,"and long, long vale to travel through;---"
4544,74,"he listens, puzzled, sore perplexed,"
4545,74,but he submits; what can he do ?
4546,74,
4547,74,no strife disturbs his sister's breast;
4548,74,she wars not with the mystery
4549,74,"of time and distance, night and day;"
4550,74,"the bonds of our humanity,"
4551,74,
4552,74,"her joy is like an instinct, joy"
4553,74,"of kitten, bird, or summer fly;"
4554,74,"she dances, runs without an aim,"
4555,74,"she chatters in her ecstasy,"
4556,74,
4557,74,"her brother now takes up the note,"
4558,74,and echoes back his sister's glee;
4559,74,"they hug the infant in my arms,"
4560,74,"as if to force his sympathy,"
4561,74,
4562,74,"then, settling into fond discourse,"
4563,74,we rested in the garden bower;
4564,74,while sweetly shone the evening sun
4565,74,"in his departing hour,"
4566,74,
4567,74,"we told o'er all that we had done,---"
4568,74,our rambles by the swift brook's side
4569,74,"far as the willow-skirted pool,"
4570,74,"where two fair swans together glide,"
4571,74,
4572,74,"we talked of change, of winter gone,"
4573,74,"of green leaves on the hawthorn spray,"
4574,74,of birds that build their nests and sing
4575,74,and all since mother went away!
4576,74,
4577,74,"to her these tales they will repeat,"
4578,74,"to her our new-born tribes will show,"
4579,74,"the gosling's green, the ass's colt,"
4580,74,"the lambs that in the meadow go,"
4581,74,
4582,74,"---but, see, the evening star comes forth!"
4583,74,to bed the children must depart;
4584,74,"a moment's heaviness they feel,"
4585,74,a sadness at the heart;
4586,74,
4587,74,'tis gone---and in a merry fit
4588,74,they run up stairs in gamesome race;
4589,74,"i, too, infected by their mood,"
4590,74,"i could have joined the wanton chase,"
4591,74,
4592,74,"five minutes past---and, o the change!"
4593,74,asleep upon their beds they lie;
4594,74,"their buy limbs in perfect rest,"
4595,74,"and closed the sparkling eye,"
4596,75,", i saw an aged beggar in my walk;"
4597,75,"  and he was seated, by the highway side,"
4598,75,  on a low structure of rude masonry
4599,75,"  built at the foot of a huge hill, that they"
4600,75,  who lead their horses down the steep rough road
4601,75,"  may thence remount at ease, the aged man"
4602,75,  had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone
4603,75,"  that overlays the pile; and, from a bag"
4604,75,"  all white with flour, the dole of village dames,"
4605,75," he drew his scraps and fragments, one by one;"
4606,75, and scanned them with a fixed and serious look
4607,75," of idle computation, in the sun,"
4608,75," upon the second step of that small pile,"
4609,75," surrounded by those wild, unpeopled hills,"
4610,75," he sat, and ate his food in solitude,"
4611,75," and ever, scattered from his palsied hand,"
4612,75," that, still attempting to prevent the waste,"
4613,75," was baffled still, the crumbs in little showers"
4614,75, fell on the ground; and the small mountain birds
4615,75," not venturing yet to peck their destined meal,"
4616,75,"approached within the length of half his staff,"
4617,75, him from my childhood have i known; and then
4618,75," he was so old, he seems not older now;"
4619,75," he travels on, a solitary man,"
4620,75," so helpless in appearance, that from him"
4621,75, the sauntering horseman throws not with a slack
4622,75," and careless hand his alms upon the ground,"
4623,75," but stops,--that he may safely lodge the coin"
4624,75," within the old man's hat; nor quits him so,"
4625,75," but still, when he has given his horse the rein,"
4626,75, watches the aged beggar with a look
4627,75," sidelong, and half-reverted, she who tends"
4628,75," the toll-gate, when in summer at her door"
4629,75," she turns her wheel, if on the road she sees"
4630,75," the aged beggar coming, quits her work,"
4631,75," and lifts the latch for him that he may pass,"
4632,75," the post-boy, when his rattling wheels o'ertake"
4633,75," the aged beggar in the woody lane,"
4634,75," shouts to him from behind; and if, thus warned,"
4635,75," the old man does not change his course, the boy"
4636,75," turns with less noisy wheels to the roadside,"
4637,75," and passes gently by, without a curse"
4638,75," upon his lips, or anger at his heart,"
4639,75," he travels on, a solitary man;"
4640,75," his age has no companion, on the ground"
4641,75," his eyes are turned, and, as he moves along,"
4642,75," they move along the ground; and, evermore,"
4643,75, instead of common and habitual sight
4644,75," of fields, with rural works, of hill and dale,"
4645,75," and the blue sky, one little span of earth"
4646,75," is all his prospect, thus, from day to day,"
4647,75," bow-bent, his eyes forever on the ground,"
4648,75," he plies his weary journey; seeing still,"
4649,75," and seldom knowing that he sees, some straw,"
4650,75," some scattered leaf, or marks which, in one track,"
4651,75, the nails of cart or chariot-wheel have left
4652,75," impressed on the white road,--in the same line,"
4653,75," at distance still the same, poor traveller!"
4654,75, his staff trails with him; scarcely do his feet
4655,75, disturb the summer dust; he is so still
4656,75," in look and motion, that the cottage curs,"
4657,75," ere he has passed the door, will turn away,"
4658,75," weary of barking at him, boys and girls,"
4659,75," the vacant and the busy, maids and youths,"
4660,75," and urchins newly breeched--all pass him by,"
4661,75," him even the slow-paced waggon leaves behind,"
4662,75," but deem not this man useless,--statesmen! ye"
4663,75," who are so restless in your wisdom, ye"
4664,75, who have a broom still ready in your hands
4665,75," to rid the world of nuisances; ye proud,"
4666,75," heart-swoln, while in your pride ye contemplate"
4667,75," your talents, power, or wisdom, deem him not"
4668,75, a burden of the earth! 'tis nature's law
4669,75," that none, the meanest of created things,"
4670,75," of forms created the most vile and brute,"
4671,75," the dullest or most noxious, should exist"
4672,75," divorced from good--a spirit and pulse of good,"
4673,75," a life and soul, to every mode of being"
4674,75," inseparably linked, then be assured"
4675,75, that least of all can aught--that ever owned
4676,75, the heaven-regarding eye and front sublime
4677,75," which man is born to--sink, howe'er depressed,"
4678,75, so low as to be scorned without a sin;
4679,75, without offence to god cast out of view;
4680,75, like the dry remnant of a garden-flower
4681,75," whose seeds are shed, or as an implement"
4682,75," worn out and worthless, while from door to door,"
4683,75," this old man creeps, the villagers in him"
4684,75, behold a record which together binds
4685,75," past deeds and offices of charity,"
4686,75," else unremembered, and so keeps alive"
4687,75," the kindly mood in hearts which lapse of years,"
4688,75," and that half-wisdom half-experience gives,"
4689,75," make slow to feel, and by sure steps resign"
4690,75," to selfishness and cold oblivious cares,"
4691,75," among the farms and solitary huts,"
4692,75," hamlets and thinly-scattered villages,"
4693,75," where'er the aged beggar takes his rounds,"
4694,75, the mild necessity of use compels
4695,75,the acts of love; and habit does the work
4696,75,of reason; yet prepares that after-joy
4697,75,"which reason cherishes, and thus the soul,"
4698,75,"by that sweet taste of pleasure unpursued,"
4699,75,doth find herself insensibly disposed
4700,75,"to virtue and true goodness,"
4701,75,                  some there are
4702,75,
4703,75,"by their good works exalted, lofty minds"
4704,75,"and meditative, authors of delight"
4705,75,"and happiness, which to the end of time"
4706,75,"will live, and spread, and kindle, even such minds"
4707,75,"in childhood, from this solitary being,"
4708,75,"or from like wanderer, haply have received"
4709,75,a thing more precious far than all that books
4710,75,or the solicitudes of love can do!
4711,75,"that first mild touch of sympathy and thought,"
4712,75,in which they found their kindred with a world
4713,75,"where want and sorrow were, the easy man"
4714,75,"who sits at his own door,--and, like the pear"
4715,75,"that overhangs his head from the green wall,"
4716,75,"feeds in the sunshine; the robust and young,"
4717,75,"the prosperous and unthinking, they who live"
4718,75,"sheltered, and flourish in a little grove"
4719,75,of their own kindred;--all behold in him
4720,75,"a silent monitor, which on their minds"
4721,75,must needs impress a transitory thought
4722,75,"of self-congratulation, to the heart"
4723,75,"of each recalling his peculiar boons,"
4724,75,"his charters and exemptions; and, perchance,"
4725,75,though he to no one give the fortitude
4726,75,and circumspection needful to preserve
4727,75,"his present blessings, and to husband up"
4728,75,"the respite of the season, he, at least,"
4729,75,"and 't is no vulgar service, makes them felt,"
4730,75,
4731,75,"yet further,--many, i believe, there are"
4732,75,"who live a life of virtuous decency,"
4733,75,men who can hear the decalogue and feel
4734,75,no self-reproach; who of the moral law
4735,75,established in the land where they abide
4736,75, are strict observers; and not negligent
4737,75,"in acts of love to those with whom they dwell,"
4738,75,"their kindred, and the children of their blood,"
4739,75,
4740,75,"praise be to such, and to their slumbers peace!"
4741,75,"but of the poor man ask, the abject poor;"
4742,75,"go, and demand of him, if there be here"
4743,75,"in this cold abstinence from evil deeds,"
4744,75,"and these inevitable charities,"
4745,75,wherewith to satisfy the human soul?
4746,75,no--man is dear to man; the poorest poor
4747,75,long for some moments in a weary life
4748,75,"when they can know and feel that they have been,"
4749,75,"themselves, the fathers and the dealers-out"
4750,75,of some small blessings; have been kind to such
4751,75,"as needed kindness, for this single cause,"
4752,75,"that we have all of us one human heart,"
4753,75,"--such pleasure is to one kind being known,"
4754,75,"my neighbour, when with punctual care, each week"
4755,75,"duly as friday comes, though pressed herself"
4756,75,"by her own wants, she from her store of meal"
4757,75,takes one unsparing handful for the scrip
4758,75,"of this old mendicant, and, from her door"
4759,75,"returning with exhilarated heart,"
4760,75,"sits by her fire, and builds her hope in heaven,"
4761,75,
4762,75,"then let him pass, a blessing on his head!"
4763,75,and while in that vast solitude to which
4764,75,"the tide of things has borne him, he appears"
4765,75,"to breathe and live but for himself alone,"
4766,75,"unblamed, uninjured, let him bear about"
4767,75,the good which the benignant law of heaven
4768,75,"has hung around him, and, while life is his,"
4769,75,still let him prompt the unlettered villagers
4770,75,"to tender offices and pensive thoughts,"
4771,75,"--then let him pass, a blessing on his head!"
4772,75,"and, long as he can wander, let him breathe"
4773,75,the freshness of the valleys; let his blood
4774,75,struggle with frosty air and winter snows;
4775,75,and let the chartered wind that sweeps the heath
4776,75,"beat his grey locks against his withered face,"
4777,75,reverence the hope whose vital anxiousness
4778,75,"gives the last human interest to his heart,"
4779,75,"may never house, misnamed of industry,"
4780,75,"make him a captive!--for that pent-up din,"
4781,75,"those life-consuming sounds that clog the air,"
4782,75,be his the natural silence of old age!
4783,75,let him be free of mountain solitudes;
4784,75,"and have around him, whether heard or not,"
4785,75,"the pleasant melody of woodland birds,"
4786,75,"few are his pleasures, if his eyes have now"
4787,75,been doomed so long to settle upon earth
4788,75,that not without some effort they behold
4789,75,"the countenance of the horizontal sun,"
4790,75,"rising or setting, let the light at least"
4791,75,"find a free entrance to their languid orbs,"
4792,75,"and let him, where and when he will, sit down"
4793,75,"beneath the trees, or on a grassy bank"
4794,75,"of highway side, and with the little birds"
4795,75,"share his chance-gathered meal; and, finally,"
4796,75,"as in the eye of nature he has lived,"
4797,75,so in the eye of nature let him die!
4798,76,"the power of armies is a visible thing,"
4799,76,formal and circumscribed in time and space;
4800,76,but who the limits of that power shall trace
4801,76,which a brave people into light can bring
4802,76,"or hide, at will,--for freedom combating"
4803,76,"by just revenge inflamed? no foot may chase,"
4804,76,"no eye can follow, to a fatal place"
4805,76,"that power, that spirit, whether on the wing"
4806,76,"like the strong wind, or sleeping like the wind"
4807,76,"within its awful caves,--from year to year"
4808,76,springs this indigenous produce far and near;
4809,76,"no craft this subtle element can bind,"
4810,76," rising like water from the soil, to find"
4811,76," in every nook a lip that it may cheer,"
4812,77,--was it for this
4813,77,"   that one, the fairest of all rivers, lov'd"
4814,77,"   to blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,"
4815,77,"   and from his alder shades and rocky falls,"
4816,77,"   and from his fords and shallows, sent a voice"
4817,77,"   that flow'd along my dreams? for this, didst thou,"
4818,77,   o derwent! travelling over the green plains
4819,77,"   near my 'sweet birthplace', didst thou, beauteous stream"
4820,77,   make ceaseless music through the night and day
4821,77,"  which with its steady cadence, tempering"
4822,77,"  our human waywardness, compos'd my thoughts"
4823,77,"  to more than infant softness, giving me,"
4824,77,"  among the fretful dwellings of mankind,"
4825,77,"  a knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm"
4826,77,"  that nature breathes among the hills and groves,"
4827,77,"  when, having left his mountains, to the towers"
4828,77,"  of cockermouth that beauteous river came,"
4829,77,"  behind my father's house he pass'd, close by,"
4830,77,"  along the margin of our terrace walk,"
4831,77,"  he was a playmate whom we dearly lov'd,"
4832,77,"  oh! many a time have i, a five years' child,"
4833,77,"  a naked boy, in one delightful rill,"
4834,77,"  a little mill-race sever'd from his stream,"
4835,77,"  made one long bathing of a summer's day,"
4836,77,"  bask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd again"
4837,77,"  alternate all a summer's day, or cours'd"
4838,77,"  over the sandy fields, leaping through groves"
4839,77,"  of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill,"
4840,77,"  the woods, and distant skiddaw's lofty height,"
4841,77,"  were bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood alone"
4842,77,"  beneath the sky, as if i had been born"
4843,77,"  on indian plains, and from my mother's hut"
4844,77,"  had run abroad in wantonness, to sport,"
4845,77,"  a naked savage, in the thunder shower,"
4846,77,
4847,77,"      fair seed-time had my soul, and i grew up"
4848,77,  foster'd alike by beauty and by fear;
4849,77,"  much favour'd in my birthplace, and no less"
4850,77,"  in that beloved vale to which, erelong,"
4851,77,"  i was transplanted, well i call to mind"
4852,77,"  'twas at an early age, ere i had seen"
4853,77,  nine summers when upon the mountain slope
4854,77,  the frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd
4855,77,"  the last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy"
4856,77,  to wander half the night among the cliffs
4857,77,"  and the smooth hollows, where the woodcocks ran"
4858,77,"  along the open turf, in thought and wish"
4859,77,"  that time, my shoulder all with springes hung,"
4860,77,"  i was a fell destroyer, on the heights"
4861,77,"  scudding away from snare to snare, i plied"
4862,77,"  my anxious visitation, hurrying on,"
4863,77,"  still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars"
4864,77,"  were shining o'er my head; i was alone,"
4865,77,  and seem'd to be a trouble to the peace
4866,77,"  that was among them, sometimes it befel"
4867,77,"  in these night-wanderings, that a strong desire"
4868,77,"  o'erpower'd my better reason, and the bird"
4869,77,  which was the captive of another's toils
4870,77,"  became my prey; and, when the deed was done"
4871,77,  i heard among the solitary hills
4872,77,"   low breathings coming after me, and sounds"
4873,77,"  of undistinguishable motion, steps"
4874,77,"  almost as silent as the turf they trod,"
4875,77,  nor less in springtime when on southern banks
4876,77,  the shining sun had from his knot of leaves
4877,77,"  decoy'd the primrose flower, and when the vales"
4878,77,"  and woods were warm, was i a plunderer then"
4879,77,"  in the high places, on the lonesome peaks"
4880,77,"  where'er, among the mountains and the winds,"
4881,77,"  the mother bird had built her lodge, though mean"
4882,77,"  my object, and inglorious, yet the end"
4883,77,"  was not ignoble, oh! when i have hung"
4884,77,"  above the raven's nest, by knots of grass"
4885,77,  and half-inch fissures in the slippery rock
4886,77,"  but ill sustain'd, and almost, as it seem'd,"
4887,77,"  suspended by the blast which blew amain,"
4888,77,"  shouldering the naked crag; oh! at that time,"
4889,77,"  while on the perilous ridge i hung alone,"
4890,77,  with what strange utterance did the loud dry wind
4891,77,  blow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a sky
4892,77,"  of earth, and with what motion mov'd the clouds!"
4893,77,
4894,77,      the mind of man is fram'd even like the breath
4895,77,"  and harmony of music, there is a dark"
4896,77,  invisible workmanship that reconciles
4897,77,"  discordant elements, and makes them move"
4898,77,"  in one society, ah me! that all"
4899,77,"  the terrors, all the early miseries"
4900,77,"  regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all"
4901,77,  the thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd
4902,77,"  into my mind, should ever have made up"
4903,77,  the calm existence that is mine when i
4904,77,  am worthy of myself! praise to the end!
4905,77,  thanks likewise for the means! but i believe
4906,77,"  that nature, oftentimes, when she would frame"
4907,77,"  a favor'd being, from his earliest dawn"
4908,77,"  of infancy doth open out the clouds,"
4909,77,"  as at the touch of lightning, seeking him"
4910,77,"  with gentlest visitation; not the less,"
4911,77,"  though haply aiming at the self-same end,"
4912,77,  does it delight her sometimes to employ
4913,77," severer interventions, ministry"
4914,77," more palpable, and so she dealt with me,"
4915,77,
4916,77,    one evening surely i was led by her
4917,77," i went alone into a shepherd's boat,"
4918,77, a skiff that to a willow tree was tied
4919,77," within a rocky cave, its usual home,"
4920,77," 'twas by the shores of patterdale, a vale"
4921,77," wherein i was a stranger, thither come"
4922,77," a school-boy traveller, at the holidays,"
4923,77, forth rambled from the village inn alone
4924,77," no sooner had i sight of this small skiff,"
4925,77," discover'd thus by unexpected chance,"
4926,77," than i unloos'd her tether and embark'd,"
4927,77," the moon was up, the lake was shining clear"
4928,77, among the hoary mountains; from the shore
4929,77," i push'd, and struck the oars and struck again"
4930,77," in cadence, and my little boat mov'd on"
4931,77, even like a man who walks with stately step
4932,77," though bent on speed, it was an act of stealth"
4933,77, and troubled pleasure; not without the voice
4934,77," of mountain-echoes did my boat move on,"
4935,77, leaving behind her still on either side
4936,77," small circles glittering idly in the moon,"
4937,77, until they melted all into one track
4938,77," of sparkling light, a rocky steep uprose"
4939,77, above the cavern of the willow tree
4940,77," and now, as suited one who proudly row'd"
4941,77," with his best skill, i fix'd a steady view"
4942,77," upon the top of that same craggy ridge,"
4943,77," the bound of the horizon, for behind"
4944,77," was nothing but the stars and the grey sky,"
4945,77, she was an elfin pinnace; lustily
4946,77," i dipp'd my oars into the silent lake,"
4947,77," and, as i rose upon the stroke, my boat"
4948,77," went heaving through the water, like a swan;"
4949,77," when from behind that craggy steep, till then"
4950,77," the bound of the horizon, a huge cliff,"
4951,77," as if with voluntary power instinct,"
4952,77," uprear'd its head, i struck, and struck again"
4953,77," and, growing still in stature, the huge cliff"
4954,77," rose up between me and the stars, and still,"
4955,77," with measur'd motion, like a living thing,"
4956,77," strode after me, with trembling hands i turn'd,"
4957,77, and through the silent water stole my way
4958,77," back to the cavern of the willow tree,"
4959,77," there, in her mooring-place, i left my bark,"
4960,77," and, through the meadows homeward went, with grave"
4961,77, and serious thoughts; and after i had seen
4962,77," that spectacle, for many days, my brain"
4963,77, work'd with a dim and undetermin'd sense
4964,77, of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts
4965,77," there was a darkness, call it solitude,"
4966,77," or blank desertion, no familiar shapes"
4967,77," of hourly objects, images of trees,"
4968,77," of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;"
4969,77, but huge and mighty forms that do not live
4970,77, like living men mov'd slowly through the mind
4971,77," by day and were the trouble of my dreams,"
4972,77,
4973,77,    wisdom and spirit of the universe!
4974,77, thou soul that art the eternity of thought!
4975,77, that giv'st to forms and images a breath
4976,77," and everlasting motion! not in vain,"
4977,77, by day or star-light thus from my first dawn
4978,77, of childhood didst thou intertwine for me
4979,77," the passions that build up our human soul,"
4980,77," not with the mean and vulgar works of man,"
4981,77," but with high objects, with enduring things,"
4982,77," with life and nature, purifying thus"
4983,77," the elements of feeling and of thought,"
4984,77," and sanctifying, by such discipline,"
4985,77," both pain and fear, until we recognize"
4986,77," a grandeur in the beatings of the heart,"
4987,77,
4988,77,    nor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to me
4989,77," with stinted kindness, in november days,"
4990,77," when vapours, rolling down the valleys, made"
4991,77, a lonely scene more lonesome; among woods
4992,77," at noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,"
4993,77," when, by the margin of the trembling lake,"
4994,77, beneath the gloomy hills i homeward went
4995,77," in solitude, such intercourse was mine;"
4996,77," 'twas mine among the fields both day and night,"
4997,77," and by the waters all the summer long,"
4998,77,
4999,77,"    and in the frosty season, when the sun"
5000,77," was set, and visible for many a mile"
5001,77," the cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd,"
5002,77," i heeded not the summons,--happy time"
5003,77," it was, indeed, for all of us; to me"
5004,77," it was a time of rapture, clear and loud"
5005,77," the village clock toll'd six; i wheel'd about,"
5006,77," proud and exulting, like an untired horse,"
5007,77," that cares not for its home,--all shod with steel,"
5008,77," we hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in games"
5009,77," confederate, imitative of the chace"
5010,77," and woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,"
5011,77," the pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare,"
5012,77," so through the darkness and the cold we flew,"
5013,77," and not a voice was idle; with the din,"
5014,77," meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud,"
5015,77," the leafless trees, and every icy crag"
5016,77," tinkled like iron, while the distant hills"
5017,77, into the tumult sent an alien sound
5018,77," of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,"
5019,77," eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west"
5020,77," the orange sky of evening died away,"
5021,77,
5022,77,    not seldom from the uproar i retired
5023,77," into a silent bay, or sportively"
5024,77," glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,"
5025,77, to cut across the image of a star
5026,77," that gleam'd upon the ice, and oftentimes"
5027,77," when we had given our bodies to the wind,"
5028,77," and all the shadowy banks, on either side,"
5029,77," came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still"
5030,77, the rapid line of motion; then at once
5031,77," have i, reclining back upon my heels,"
5032,77," stopp'd short, yet still the solitary cliffs"
5033,77," wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll'd"
5034,77, with visible motion her diurnal round;
5035,77, behind me did they stretch in solemn train
5036,77," feebler and feebler, and i stood and watch'd"
5037,77," till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep,"
5038,77,
5039,77,"    ye presences of nature, in the sky"
5040,77, and on the earth! ye visions of the hills!
5041,77, and souls of lonely places! can i think
5042,77, a vulgar hope was yours when ye employ'd
5043,77," such ministry, when ye through many a year"
5044,77," haunting me thus among my boyish sports,"
5045,77," on caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,"
5046,77, impress'd upon all forms the characters
5047,77," of danger or desire, and thus did make"
5048,77, the surface of the universal earth
5049,77," with triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear,"
5050,77," work like a sea?       not uselessly employ'd,"
5051,77, i might pursue this theme through every change
5052,77," of exercise and play, to which the year"
5053,77," did summon us in its delightful round,"
5054,77,
5055,77,"    we were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven"
5056,77," beheld not vales more beautiful than ours,"
5057,77, nor saw a race in happiness and joy
5058,77," more worthy of the ground where they were sown,"
5059,77, i would record with no reluctant voice
5060,77, the woods of autumn and their hazel bowers
5061,77," with milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,"
5062,77," true symbol of the foolishness of hope,"
5063,77, which with its strong enchantment led us on
5064,77," by rocks and pools, shut out from every star"
5065,77," all the green summer, to forlorn cascades"
5066,77," among the windings of the mountain brooks,"
5067,77, --unfading recollections! at this hour
5068,77, the heart is almost mine with which i felt
5069,77," from some hill-top, on sunny afternoons"
5070,77, the kite high up among the fleecy clouds
5071,77," pull at its rein, like an impatient courser,"
5072,77," or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,"
5073,77," beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly"
5074,77," dash'd headlong; and rejected by the storm,"
5075,77,
5076,77,"    ye lowly cottages in which we dwelt,"
5077,77," a ministration of your own was yours,"
5078,77," a sanctity, a safeguard, and a love!"
5079,77," can i forget you, being as ye were"
5080,77, so beautiful among the pleasant fields
5081,77, in which ye stood? or can i here forget
5082,77, the plain and seemly countenance with which
5083,77, ye dealt out your plain comforts? yet had ye
5084,77," delights and exultations of your own,"
5085,77, eager and never weary we pursued
5086,77, our home amusements by the warm peat-fire
5087,77," at evening; when with pencil and with slate,"
5088,77," in square divisions parcell'd out, and all"
5089,77," with crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,"
5090,77," we schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head"
5091,77," in strife too humble to be named in verse,"
5092,77," or round the naked table, snow-white deal,"
5093,77," cherry or maple, sate in close array,"
5094,77," and to the combat, lu or whist, led on"
5095,77, thick-ribbed army; not as in the world
5096,77, neglected and ungratefully thrown by
5097,77," even for the very service they had wrought,"
5098,77," but husbanded through many a long campaign,"
5099,77," uncouth assemblage was it, where no few"
5100,77," had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards,"
5101,77, which fate beyond the promise of their birth
5102,77," had glorified, and call'd to represent"
5103,77," the persons of departed potentates,"
5104,77, oh! with what echoes on the board they fell!
5105,77," ironic diamonds, clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,"
5106,77," a congregation piteously akin,"
5107,77," cheap matter did they give to boyish wit,"
5108,77," those sooty knaves, precipitated down"
5109,77," with scoffs and taunts, like vulcan out of heaven,"
5110,77," the paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse,"
5111,77," queens, gleaming through their splendour's last decay,"
5112,77," and monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain'd"
5113,77," by royal visages, meanwhile, abroad"
5114,77," the heavy rain was falling, or the frost"
5115,77," raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth,"
5116,77," and, interrupting oft the impassion'd game,"
5117,77," from esthwaite's neighbouring lake the splitting ice,"
5118,77," while it sank down towards the water, sent,"
5119,77," among the meadows and the hills, its long"
5120,77," and dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves"
5121,77," when they are howling round the bothnic main,"
5122,77,
5123,77,"    nor, sedulous as i have been to trace"
5124,77, how nature by extrinsic passion first
5125,77," peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand,"
5126,77," and made me love them, may i well forget"
5127,77," how other pleasures have been mine, and joys"
5128,77," of subtler origin; how i have felt,"
5129,77," not seldom, even in that tempestuous time,"
5130,77, those hallow'd and pure motions of the sense
5131,77," which seem, in their simplicity, to own"
5132,77," an intellectual charm, that calm delight"
5133,77," which, if i err not, surely must belong"
5134,77, to those first-born affinities that fit
5135,77," our new existence to existing things,"
5136,77," and, in our dawn of being, constitute"
5137,77," the bond of union betwixt life and joy,"
5138,77,
5139,77,"    yes, i remember, when the changeful earth,"
5140,77, and twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd
5141,77," the faces of the moving year, even then,"
5142,77," a child, i held unconscious intercourse"
5143,77," with the eternal beauty, drinking in"
5144,77, a pure organic pleasure from the lines
5145,77," of curling mist, or from the level plain"
5146,77," of waters colour'd by the steady clouds,"
5147,77,
5148,77,"    the sands of westmoreland, the creeks and bays"
5149,77," of cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell"
5150,77, how when the sea threw off his evening shade
5151,77, and to the shepherd's huts beneath the crags
5152,77," did send sweet notice of the rising moon,"
5153,77," how i have stood, to fancies such as these,"
5154,77," engrafted in the tenderness of thought,"
5155,77," a stranger, linking with the spectacle"
5156,77," no conscious memory of a kindred sight,"
5157,77, and bringing with me no peculiar sense
5158,77," of quietness or peace, yet i have stood,"
5159,77, even while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long leagues
5160,77," of shining water, gathering, as it seem'd,"
5161,77," through every hair-breadth of that field of light,"
5162,77," new pleasure, like a bee among the flowers,"
5163,77,
5164,77,"    thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy"
5165,77," which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits"
5166,77," are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss"
5167,77," which, like a tempest, works along the blood"
5168,77, and is forgotten; even then i felt
5169,77, gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth
5170,77, and common face of nature spake to me
5171,77," rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,"
5172,77, by chance collisions and quaint accidents
5173,77," like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd"
5174,77," of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain"
5175,77," nor profitless, if haply they impress'd"
5176,77," collateral objects and appearances,"
5177,77," albeit lifeless then, and doom'd to sleep"
5178,77, until maturer seasons call'd them forth
5179,77," to impregnate and to elevate the mind,"
5180,77, --and if the vulgar joy by its own weight
5181,77," wearied itself out of the memory,"
5182,77, the scenes which were a witness of that joy
5183,77," remained, in their substantial lineaments"
5184,77," depicted on the brain, and to the eye"
5185,77," were visible, a daily sight; and thus"
5186,77," by the impressive discipline of fear,"
5187,77," by pleasure and repeated happiness,"
5188,77," so frequently repeated, and by force"
5189,77, of obscure feelings representative
5190,77," of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes,"
5191,77," so beauteous and majestic in themselves,"
5192,77," though yet the day was distant, did at length"
5193,77," become habitually dear, and all"
5194,77, their hues and forms were by invisible links
5195,77," allied to the affections,       i began"
5196,77," my story early, feeling as i fear,"
5197,77," the weakness of a human love, for days"
5198,77," disown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring"
5199,77," planting my snowdrops among winter snows,"
5200,77," nor will it seem to thee, my friend! so prompt"
5201,77," in sympathy, that i have lengthen'd out,"
5202,77," with fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale,"
5203,77," meanwhile, my hope has been that i might fetch"
5204,77," invigorating thoughts from former years,"
5205,77," might fix the wavering balance of my wind,"
5206,77," and haply meet reproaches, too, whose power"
5207,77," may spur me on, in manhood now mature,"
5208,77," to honorable toil, yet should these hopes"
5209,77," be vain, and thus should neither i be taught"
5210,77," to understand myself, nor thou to know"
5211,77, with better knowledge how the heart was fram'd
5212,77," of him thou lovest, need i dread from thee"
5213,77," harsh judgments, if i am so loth to quit"
5214,77, those recollected hours that have the charm
5215,77," of visionary things, and lovely forms"
5216,77, and sweet sensations that throw back our life
5217,77, and almost make our infancy itself
5218,77," a visible scene, on which the sun is shining?"
5219,77,
5220,77,"    one end hereby at least hath been attain'd,"
5221,77," my mind hath been revived, and if this mood"
5222,77," desert me not, i will forthwith bring down,"
5223,77," through later years, the story of my life,"
5224,77, the road lies plain before me; 'tis a theme
5225,77, single and of determined bounds; and hence
5226,77," i chuse it rather at this time, than work"
5227,77," of ampler or more varied argument,"
5228,78,",  thus far, o friend! have we, though leaving much"
5229,78,"   unvisited, endeavour'd to retrace"
5230,78,"   my life through its first years, and measured back"
5231,78,   the way i travell'd when i first began
5232,78,   to love the woods and fields; the passion yet
5233,78,"   was in its birth, sustain'd, as might befal,"
5234,78,"   by nourishment that came unsought, for still,"
5235,78,"   from week to week, from month to month, we liv'd"
5236,78,"   a round of tumult, duly were our games"
5237,78,  prolong'd in summer till the day-light fail'd;
5238,78,"  no chair remain'd before the doors, the bench"
5239,78,  and threshold steps were empty; fast asleep
5240,78,"  the labourer, and the old man who had sate,"
5241,78,"  a later lingerer, yet the revelry"
5242,78,"  continued, and the loud uproar, at last,"
5243,78,"  when all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds"
5244,78,"  were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went,"
5245,78,"  with weary joints, and with a beating mind,"
5246,78,"  ah! is there one who ever has been young,"
5247,78,  nor needs a monitory voice to tame
5248,78,"  the pride of virtue, and of intellect?"
5249,78,"  and is there one, the wisest and the best"
5250,78,"  of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish"
5251,78,"  for things which cannot be, who would not give,"
5252,78,"  if so he might, to duty and to truth"
5253,78,  the eagerness of infantine desire?
5254,78,  a tranquillizing spirit presses now
5255,78,"  on my corporeal frame, so wide appears"
5256,78,"  the vacancy between me and those days,"
5257,78,  which yet have such self-presence in my mind
5258,78,"  that, sometimes, when i think of them, i seem"
5259,78,"  two consciousnesses, conscious of myself"
5260,78,"  and of some other being, a grey stone"
5261,78,"  of native rock, left midway in the square"
5262,78,"  of our small market village, was the home"
5263,78,"  and centre of these joys, and when, return'd"
5264,78,"  after long absence, thither i repair'd,"
5265,78,"  i found that it was split, and gone to build"
5266,78,  a smart assembly-room that perk'd and flar'd
5267,78,  with wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground
5268,78,"  which had been ours, but let the fiddle scream,"
5269,78,"  and be ye happy! yet, my friends! i know"
5270,78,  that more than one of you will think with me
5271,78,"  of those soft starry nights, and that old dame"
5272,78,  from whom the stone was nam'd who there had sate
5273,78,  and watch'd her table with its huckster's wares
5274,78,"  assiduous, thro' the length of sixty years,"
5275,78,
5276,78,      we ran a boisterous race; the year span round
5277,78,"  with giddy motion, but the time approach'd"
5278,78,  that brought with it a regular desire
5279,78,"  for calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms"
5280,78,  of nature were collaterally attach'd
5281,78,"  to every scheme of holiday delight,"
5282,78,"  and every boyish sport, less grateful else,"
5283,78,"  and languidly pursued,         when summer came"
5284,78,  it was the pastime of our afternoons
5285,78,  to beat along the plain of windermere
5286,78,"  with rival oars, and the selected bourne"
5287,78,  was now an island musical with birds
5288,78,  that sang for ever; now a sister isle
5289,78,"  beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown"
5290,78,"  with lillies of the valley, like a field;"
5291,78,  and now a third small island where remain'd
5292,78,"  an old stone table, and a moulder'd cave,"
5293,78,"  a hermit's history, in such a race,"
5294,78,"  so ended, disappointment could be none,"
5295,78,"  uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy,"
5296,78,"  we rested in the shade, all pleas'd alike,"
5297,78,"  conquer'd and conqueror, thus the pride of strength,"
5298,78,  and the vain-glory of superior skill
5299,78,  were interfus'd with objects which subdu'd
5300,78,"  and temper'd them, and gradually produc'd"
5301,78,"  a quiet independence of the heart,"
5302,78,"  and to my friend, who knows me, i may add,"
5303,78,"  unapprehensive of reproof, that hence"
5304,78,"  ensu'd a diffidence and modesty,"
5305,78,"  and i was taught to feel, perhaps too much,"
5306,78,"  the self-sufficing power of solitude,"
5307,78,
5308,78,      no delicate viands sapp'd our bodily strength;
5309,78,  more than we wish'd we knew the blessing then
5310,78,"  of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals"
5311,78,"  were frugal, sabine fare! and then, exclude"
5312,78,"  a little weekly stipend, and we lived"
5313,78,  through three divisions of the quarter'd year
5314,78,"  in pennyless poverty, but now, to school"
5315,78,"  return'd, from the half-yearly holidays,"
5316,78,"  we came with purses more profusely fill'd,"
5317,78,  allowance which abundantly suffic'd
5318,78,  to gratify the palate with repasts
5319,78,"  more costly than the dame of whom i spake,"
5320,78,"  that ancient woman, and her board supplied,"
5321,78,"  hence inroads into distant vales, and long"
5322,78,"  excursions far away among the hills,"
5323,78,"  hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,"
5324,78,"  or in the woods, or near a river side,"
5325,78,"  or by some shady fountain, while soft airs"
5326,78,"  among the leaves were stirring, and the sun"
5327,78,"  unfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy,"
5328,78,
5329,78,"    nor is my aim neglected, if i tell"
5330,78, how twice in the long length of those half-years
5331,78," we from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand"
5332,78," drew largely, anxious for one day, at least,"
5333,78, to feel the motion of the galloping steed;
5334,78," and with the good old inn-keeper, in truth,"
5335,78, on such occasion sometimes we employ'd
5336,78, sly subterfuge; for the intended bound
5337,78, of the day's journey was too distant far
5338,78," for any cautious man, a structure famed"
5339,78," beyond its neighbourhood, the antique walls"
5340,78, of that large abbey which within the vale
5341,78," of nightshade, to st, mary's honour built,"
5342,78," stands yet, a mouldering pile, with fractured arch,"
5343,78," belfry, and images, and living trees,"
5344,78, a holy scene! along the smooth green turf
5345,78," our horses grazed, to more than inland peace"
5346,78, left by the sea wind passing overhead
5347,78, though wind of roughest temper trees and towers
5348,78," may in that valley oftentimes be seen,"
5349,78, both silent and both motionless alike;
5350,78," such is the shelter that is there, and such"
5351,78," the safeguard for repose and quietness,"
5352,78,
5353,78,"    our steeds remounted, and the summons given,"
5354,78, with whip and spur we by the chauntry flew
5355,78," in uncouth race, and left the cross-legg'd knight,"
5356,78," and the stone-abbot, and that single wren"
5357,78, which one day sang so sweetly in the nave
5358,78," of the old church, that, though from recent showers"
5359,78," the earth was comfortless, and, touch'd by faint"
5360,78," internal breezes, sobbings of the place,"
5361,78," and respirations, from the roofless walls"
5362,78," the shuddering ivy dripp'd large drops, yet still,"
5363,78, so sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird
5364,78," sang to itself, that there i could have made"
5365,78," my dwelling-place, and liv'd for ever there"
5366,78," to hear such music, through the walls we flew"
5367,78," and down the valley, and a circuit made"
5368,78," in wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth"
5369,78," we scamper'd homeward, oh! ye rocks and streams,"
5370,78, and that still spirit of the evening air!
5371,78, even in this joyous time i sometimes felt
5372,78," your presence, when with slacken'd step we breath'd"
5373,78," along the sides of the steep hills, or when,"
5374,78," lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea,"
5375,78," we beat with thundering hoofs the level sand,"
5376,78,
5377,78,"    upon the eastern shore of windermere,"
5378,78," above the crescent of a pleasant bay,"
5379,78," there stood an inn, no homely-featured shed,"
5380,78," brother of the surrounding cottages,"
5381,78," but 'twas a splendid place, the door beset"
5382,78," with chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within"
5383,78," decanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine,"
5384,78," in ancient times, or ere the hall was built"
5385,78," on the large island, had this dwelling been"
5386,78," more worthy of a poet's love, a hut,"
5387,78," proud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade,"
5388,78, but though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed
5389,78," the threshold, and large golden characters"
5390,78, on the blue-frosted signboard had usurp'd
5391,78," the place of the old lion, in contempt"
5392,78," and mockery of the rustic painter's hand,"
5393,78, yet to this hour the spot to me is dear
5394,78," with all its foolish pomp, the garden lay"
5395,78, upon a slope surmounted by the plain
5396,78, of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood
5397,78, a grove; with gleams of water through the trees
5398,78, and over the tree-tops; nor did we want
5399,78," refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream,"
5400,78," and there, through half an afternoon, we play'd"
5401,78," on the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent"
5402,78," made all the mountains ring, but ere the fall"
5403,78," of night, when in our pinnace we return'd"
5404,78," over the dusky lake, and to the beach"
5405,78," of some small island steer'd our course with one,"
5406,78," the minstrel of our troop, and left him there,"
5407,78," and row'd off gently, while he blew his flute"
5408,78, alone upon the rock; oh! then the calm
5409,78, and dead still water lay upon my mind
5410,78," even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky"
5411,78," never before so beautiful, sank down"
5412,78," into my heart, and held me like a dream,"
5413,78,
5414,78,"    thus daily were my sympathies enlarged,"
5415,78, and thus the common range of visible things
5416,78," grew dear to me, already i began"
5417,78," to love the sun, a boy i lov'd the sun,"
5418,78," not as i since have lov'd him, as a pledge"
5419,78," and surety of our earthly life, a light"
5420,78, which while we view we feel we are alive;
5421,78," but, for this cause, that i had seen him lay"
5422,78," his beauty on the morning hills, had seen"
5423,78," the western mountain touch his setting orb,"
5424,78," in many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess"
5425,78," of happiness, my blood appear'd to flow"
5426,78," with its own pleasure, and i breath'd with joy,"
5427,78," and from like feelings, humble though intense,"
5428,78, to patriotic and domestic love
5429,78," analogous, the moon to me was dear;"
5430,78," for i would dream away my purposes,"
5431,78, standing to look upon her while she hung
5432,78," midway between the hills, as if she knew"
5433,78," no other region; but belong'd to thee,"
5434,78," yea, appertain'd by a peculiar right"
5435,78," to thee and thy grey huts, my darling vale!"
5436,78,
5437,78,    those incidental charms which first attach'd
5438,78," my heart to rural objects, day by day"
5439,78," grew weaker, and i hasten on to tell"
5440,78," how nature, intervenient till this time,"
5441,78," and secondary, now at length was sought"
5442,78," for her own sake, but who shall parcel out"
5443,78," his intellect, by geometric rules,"
5444,78," split, like a province, into round and square?"
5445,78, who knows the individual hour in which
5446,78," his habits were first sown, even as a seed,"
5447,78," who that shall point, as with a wand, and say,"
5448,78, 'this portion of the river of my mind
5449,78," came from yon fountain?' thou, my friend! art one"
5450,78, more deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee
5451,78," science appears but, what in truth she is,"
5452,78," not as our glory and our absolute boast,"
5453,78," but as a succedaneum, and a prop"
5454,78," to our infirmity, thou art no slave"
5455,78," of that false secondary power, by which,"
5456,78," in weakness, we create distinctions, then"
5457,78, deem that our puny boundaries are things
5458,78," which we perceive, and not which we have made,"
5459,78," to thee, unblinded by these outward shows,"
5460,78, the unity of all has been reveal'd
5461,78," and thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill'd"
5462,78, than many are to class the cabinet
5463,78," of their sensations, and, in voluble phrase,"
5464,78," run through the history and birth of each,"
5465,78," as of a single independent thing,"
5466,78," hard task to analyse a soul, in which,"
5467,78," not only general habits and desires,"
5468,78," but each most obvious and particular thought,"
5469,78," not in a mystical and idle sense,"
5470,78," but in the words of reason deeply weigh'd,"
5471,78," hath no beginning,          bless'd the infant babe,"
5472,78, for with my best conjectures i would trace
5473,78," the progress of our being blest the babe,"
5474,78," nurs'd in his mother's arms, the babe who sleeps"
5475,78," upon his mother's breast, who, when his soul"
5476,78," claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul,"
5477,78, doth gather passion from his mother's eye!
5478,78, such feelings pass into his torpid life
5479,78," like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind"
5480,78, even [in the first trial of its powers]
5481,78," is prompt and watchful, eager to combine"
5482,78," in one appearance, all the elements"
5483,78," and parts of the same object, else detach'd"
5484,78," and loth to coalesce, thus, day by day,"
5485,78," subjected to the discipline of love,"
5486,78, his organs and recipient faculties
5487,78," are quicken'd, are more vigorous, his mind spreads,"
5488,78," tenacious of the forms which it receives,"
5489,78," in one beloved presence, nay and more,"
5490,78, in that most apprehensive habitude
5491,78, and those sensations which have been deriv'd
5492,78," from this beloved presence, there exists"
5493,78, a virtue which irradiates and exalts
5494,78," all objects through all intercourse of sense,"
5495,78," no outcast he, bewilder'd and depress'd;"
5496,78, along his infant veins are interfus'd
5497,78, the gravitation and the filial bond
5498,78," of nature, that connect him with the world,"
5499,78," emphatically such a being lives,"
5500,78, an inmate of this  active universe;
5501,78, from nature largely he receives; nor so
5502,78," is satisfied, but largely gives again,"
5503,78," for feeling has to him imparted strength,"
5504,78," and powerful in all sentiments of grief,"
5505,78," of exultation, fear, and joy, his mind,"
5506,78," even as an agent of the one great mind,"
5507,78," creates, creator and receiver both,"
5508,78, working but in alliance with the works
5509,78," which it beholds,--such, verily, is the first"
5510,78, poetic spirit of our human life;
5511,78, by uniform control of after years
5512,78," in most abated or suppress'd, in some,"
5513,78," through every change of growth or of decay,"
5514,78," pre-eminent till death,       from early days,"
5515,78, beginning not long after that first time
5516,78," in which, a babe, by intercourse of touch,"
5517,78, i held mute dialogues with my mother's heart
5518,78, i have endeavour'd to display the means
5519,78," whereby this infant sensibility,"
5520,78," great birthright of our being, was in me"
5521,78," augmented and sustain'd, yet is a path"
5522,78," more difficult before me, and i fear"
5523,78, that in its broken windings we shall need
5524,78," the chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing,"
5525,78, for now a trouble came into my mind
5526,78," from unknown causes, i was left alone,"
5527,78," seeking the visible world, nor knowing why,"
5528,78," the props of my affections were remov'd,"
5529,78," and yet the building stood, as if sustain'd"
5530,78, by its own spirit! all that i beheld
5531,78," was dear to me, and from this cause it came,"
5532,78, that now to nature's finer influxes
5533,78," my mind lay open, to that more exact"
5534,78, and intimate communion which our hearts
5535,78, maintain with the minuter properties
5536,78," of objects which already are belov'd,"
5537,78," and of those only, many are the joys"
5538,78, of youth; but oh! what happiness to live
5539,78, when every hour brings palpable access
5540,78," of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,"
5541,78," and sorrow is not there, the seasons came,"
5542,78, and every season to my notice brought
5543,78, a store of transitory qualities
5544,78," which, but for this most watchful power of love"
5545,78," had been neglected, left a register"
5546,78," of permanent relations, else unknown,"
5547,78," hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude"
5548,78," more active, even, than 'best society',"
5549,78, society made sweet as solitude
5550,78," by silent inobtrusive sympathies,"
5551,78, and gentle agitations of the mind
5552,78," from manifold distinctions, difference"
5553,78," perceived in things, where to the common eye,"
5554,78," no difference is; and hence, from the same source"
5555,78," sublimer joy; for i would walk alone,"
5556,78," in storm and tempest, or in starlight nights"
5557,78," beneath the quiet heavens; and, at that time,"
5558,78, have felt whate'er there is of power in sound
5559,78," to breathe an elevated mood, by form"
5560,78," or image unprofaned; and i would stand,"
5561,78," beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are"
5562,78," the ghostly language of the ancient earth,"
5563,78," or make their dim abode in distant winds,"
5564,78," thence did i drink the visionary power,"
5565,78, i deem not profitless those fleeting moods
5566,78," of shadowy exultation, not for this,"
5567,78, that they are kindred to our purer mind
5568,78," and intellectual life; but that the soul,"
5569,78," remembering how she felt, but what she felt"
5570,78," remembering not, retains an obscure sense"
5571,78," of possible sublimity, to which,"
5572,78," with growing faculties she doth aspire,"
5573,78," with faculties still growing, feeling still"
5574,78," that whatsoever point they gain, they still"
5575,78," have something to pursue,       and not alone,"
5576,78," in grandeur and in tumult, but no less"
5577,78," in tranquil scenes, that universal power"
5578,78, and fitness in the latent qualities
5579,78," and essences of things, by which the mind"
5580,78," is mov'd by feelings of delight, to me"
5581,78," came strengthen'd with a superadded soul,"
5582,78," a virtue not its own, my morning walks"
5583,78," were early; oft, before the hours of school"
5584,78," i travell'd round our little lake, five miles"
5585,78," of pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear"
5586,78," for this, that one was by my side, a friend"
5587,78, then passionately lov'd; with heart how full
5588,78," will he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps"
5589,78, a blank to other men! for many years
5590,78," have since flow'd in between us; and our minds,"
5591,78," both silent to each other, at this time"
5592,78," we live as if those hours had never been,"
5593,78, nor seldom did i lift our cottage latch
5594,78," far earlier, and before the vernal thrush"
5595,78," was audible, among the hills i sate"
5596,78," alone, upon some jutting eminence"
5597,78," at the first hour of morning, when the vale"
5598,78," lay quiet in an utter solitude,"
5599,78," how shall i trace the history, where seek"
5600,78, the origin of what i then have felt?
5601,78, oft in these moments such a holy calm
5602,78," did overspread my soul, that i forgot"
5603,78," that i had bodily eyes, and what i saw"
5604,78," appear'd like something in myself, a dream,"
5605,78," a prospect in my mind,       'twere long to tell"
5606,78," what spring and autumn, what the winter snows,"
5607,78," and what the summer shade, what day and night,"
5608,78," the evening and the morning, what my dreams"
5609,78," and what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse"
5610,78, that spirit of religious love in which
5611,78," i walked with nature, but let this, at least"
5612,78," be not forgotten, that i still retain'd"
5613,78," my first creative sensibility,"
5614,78, that by the regular action of the world
5615,78," my soul was unsubdu'd, a plastic power"
5616,78," abode with me, a forming hand, at times"
5617,78," rebellious, acting in a devious mood,"
5618,78," a local spirit of its own, at war"
5619,78," with general tendency, but for the most"
5620,78, subservient strictly to the external things
5621,78," with which it commun'd, an auxiliar light"
5622,78, came from my mind which on the setting sun
5623,78," bestow'd new splendor, the melodious birds,"
5624,78," the gentle breezes, fountains that ran on,"
5625,78," murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey'd"
5626,78, a like dominion; and the midnight storm
5627,78," grew darker in the presence of my eye,"
5628,78," hence by obeisance, my devotion hence,"
5629,78," and hence my transport,       nor should this, perchance,"
5630,78," pass unrecorded, that i still have lov'd"
5631,78, the exercise and produce of a toil
5632,78, than analytic industry to me
5633,78," more pleasing, and whose character i deem"
5634,78, is more poetic as resembling more
5635,78," creative agency, i mean to speak"
5636,78, of that interminable building rear'd
5637,78, by observation of affinities
5638,78, in objects where no brotherhood exists
5639,78," to common minds, my seventeenth year was come"
5640,78," and, whether from this habit, rooted now"
5641,78," so deeply in my mind, or from excess"
5642,78," of the great social principle of life,"
5643,78," coercing all things into sympathy,"
5644,78, to unorganic natures i transferr'd
5645,78," my own enjoyments, or, the power of truth"
5646,78," coming in revelation, i convers'd"
5647,78," with things that really are, i, at this time"
5648,78," saw blessings spread around me like a sea,"
5649,78," thus did my days pass on, and now at length"
5650,78, from nature and her overflowing soul
5651,78, i had receiv'd so much that all my thoughts
5652,78, were steep'd in feeling; i was only then
5653,78, contented when with bliss ineffable
5654,78, i felt the sentiment of being spread
5655,78," o'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still,"
5656,78," o'er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought"
5657,78," and human knowledge, to the human eye"
5658,78," invisible, yet liveth to the heart,"
5659,78," o'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings,"
5660,78," or beats the gladsome air, o'er all that glides"
5661,78," beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself"
5662,78," and mighty depth of waters, wonder not"
5663,78, if such my transports were; for in all things
5664,78," i saw one life, and felt that it was joy,"
5665,78," one song they sang, and it was audible,"
5666,78," most audible then when the fleshly ear,"
5667,78," o'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain,"
5668,78," forgot its functions, and slept undisturb'd,"
5669,78,
5670,78,"    if this be error, and another faith"
5671,78," find easier access to the pious mind,"
5672,78, yet were i grossly destitute of all
5673,78, those human sentiments which make this earth
5674,78," so dear, if i should fail, with grateful voice"
5675,78," to speak of you, ye mountains and ye lakes,"
5676,78, and sounding cataracts! ye mists and winds
5677,78," that dwell among the hills where i was born,"
5678,78," if, in my youth, i have been pure in heart,"
5679,78," if, mingling with the world, i am content"
5680,78," with my own modest pleasures, and have liv'd,"
5681,78," with god and nature communing, remov'd"
5682,78," from little enmities and low desires,"
5683,78," the gift is yours; if in these times of fear,"
5684,78," this melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,"
5685,78," if, 'mid indifference and apathy"
5686,78," and wicked exultation, when good men,"
5687,78," on every side fall off we know not how,"
5688,78," to selfishness, disguis'd in gentle names"
5689,78," of peace, and quiet, and domestic love,"
5690,78," yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers"
5691,78, on visionary minds; if in this time
5692,78," of dereliction and dismay, i yet"
5693,78, despair not of our nature; but retain
5694,78," a more than roman confidence, a faith"
5695,78," that fails not, in all sorrow my support,"
5696,78," the blessing of my life, the gift is yours,"
5697,78," ye mountains! thine, o nature! thou hast fed"
5698,78," my lofty speculations; and in thee,"
5699,78, for this uneasy heart of ours i find
5700,78," a never-failing principle of joy,"
5701,78," and purest passion,       thou, my friend! wert rear'd"
5702,78," in the great city, 'mid far other scenes;"
5703,78," but we, by different roads at length have gain'd"
5704,78," the self-same bourne, and for this cause to thee"
5705,78," i speak, unapprehensive of contempt,"
5706,78," the insinuated scoff of coward tongues,"
5707,78, and all that silent language which so oft
5708,78, in conversation betwixt man and man
5709,78, blots from the human countenance all trace
5710,78," of beauty and of love, for thou hast sought"
5711,78," the truth in solitude, and thou art one,"
5712,78, the most intense of nature's worshippers
5713,78," in many things my brother, chiefly here"
5714,78," in this my deep devotion,       fare thee well!"
5715,78," health, and the quiet of a healthful mind"
5716,78," attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,"
5717,78," and yet more often living with thyself,"
5718,78," and for thyself, so haply shall thy days"
5719,78," be many, and a blessing to mankind,"
5720,79,"when contemplation, like the night-calm felt"
5721,79,"through earth and sky, spreads widely, and sends deep"
5722,79,"into the soul its tranquillising power,"
5723,79,"even then i sometimes grieve for thee, o man,"
5724,79,earth's paramount creature! not so much for woes
5725,79,"that thou endurest; heavy though that weight be,"
5726,79,"cloud-like it mounts, or touched with light divine"
5727,79,doth melt away; but for those palms achieved
5728,79,"through length of time, by patient exercise"
5729,79,"of study and hard thought; there, there, it is"
5730,79,"that sadness finds its fuel, hitherto,"
5731,79,"in progress through this verse, my mind hath looked"
5732,79,upon the speaking face of earth and heaven
5733,79,"as her prime teacher, intercourse with man"
5734,79,"established by the sovereign intellect,"
5735,79,"who through that bodily image hath diffused,"
5736,79,"as might appear to the eye of fleeting time,"
5737,79,"a deathless spirit, thou also, man! hast wrought,"
5738,79,"for commerce of thy nature with herself,"
5739,79,things that aspire to unconquerable life;
5740,79,and yet we feel--we cannot choose but feel--
5741,79,"that they must perish, tremblings of the heart"
5742,79,"it gives, to think that our immortal being"
5743,79,"no more shall need such garments; and yet man,"
5744,79,"as long as he shall be the child of earth,"
5745,79,"might almost weep to have what he may lose,"
5746,79,"nor be himself extinguished, but survive,"
5747,79,"abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate,"
5748,79,"a thought is with me sometimes, and i say,--"
5749,79,should the whole frame of earth by inward throes
5750,79,"be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch"
5751,79,"her pleasant habitations, and dry up"
5752,79,"old ocean, in his bed left singed and bare,"
5753,79,yet would the living presence still subsist
5754,79,"victorious, and composure would ensue,"
5755,79,and kindlings like the morning--presage sure
5756,79,"of day returning and of life revived,"
5757,79,"but all the meditations of mankind,"
5758,79,"yea, all the adamantine holds of truth"
5759,79,"by reason built, or passion, which itself"
5760,79,is highest reason in a soul sublime;
5761,79,"the consecrated works of bard and sage,"
5762,79,"sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men,"
5763,79,twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes;
5764,79,where would they be? oh! why hath not the mind
5765,79,some element to stamp her image on
5766,79,in nature somewhat nearer to her own?
5767,79,"why, gifted with such powers to send abroad"
5768,79,"her spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail?"
5769,79,
5770,79,"one day, when from my lips a like complaint"
5771,79,"had fallen in presence of a studious friend,"
5772,79,"he with a smile made answer, that in truth"
5773,79,'twas going far to seek disquietude;
5774,79,but on the front of his reproof confessed
5775,79,that he himself had oftentimes given way
5776,79,"to kindred hauntings, whereupon i told,"
5777,79,"that once in the stillness of a summer's noon,"
5778,79,while i was seated in a rocky cave
5779,79,"by the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced,"
5780,79,the famous history of the errant knight
5781,79,"recorded by cervantes, these same thoughts"
5782,79,"beset me, and to height unusual rose,"
5783,79,"while listlessly i sate, and, having closed"
5784,79,"the book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea,"
5785,79,"on poetry and geometric truth,"
5786,79,"and their high privilege of lasting life,"
5787,79,"from all internal injury exempt,"
5788,79,"i mused; upon these chiefly, and at length,"
5789,79,"my senses yielding to the sultry air,"
5790,79,"sleep seized me, and i passed into a dream,"
5791,79,i saw before me stretched a boundless plain
5792,79,"of sandy wilderness, all black and void,"
5793,79,"and as i looked around, distress and fear"
5794,79,"came creeping over me, when at my side,"
5795,79,"close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared"
5796,79,"upon a dromedary, mounted high,"
5797,79,"he seemed an arab of the bedouin tribes,"
5798,79,"a lance he bore, and underneath one arm"
5799,79,"a stone, and in the opposite hand a shell"
5800,79,"of a surpassing brightness, at the sight"
5801,79,"much i rejoiced, not doubting but a guide"
5802,79,"was present, one who with unerring skill"
5803,79,would through the desert lead me; and while yet
5804,79,"i looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight"
5805,79,which the new-comer carried through the waste
5806,79,"could mean, the arab told me that the stone"
5807,79,to give it in the language of the dream
5808,79,"was euclid's elements, and this, said he,"
5809,79,is something of more worth; and at the word
5810,79,"stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape,"
5811,79,"in colour so resplendent, with command"
5812,79,"that i should hold it to my ear, i did so,"
5813,79,"and heard that instant in an unknown tongue,"
5814,79,"which yet i understood, articulate sounds,"
5815,79,a loud prophetic blast of harmony;
5816,79,"an ode, in passion uttered, which foretold"
5817,79,destruction to the children of the earth
5818,79,"by deluge, now at hand, no sooner ceased"
5819,79,"the song, than the arab with calm look declared"
5820,79,that all would come to pass of which the voice 0
5821,79,"had given forewarning, and that he himself"
5822,79,"was going then to bury those two books,"
5823,79,"the one that held acquaintance with the stars,"
5824,79,and wedded soul to soul in purest bond
5825,79,"of reason, undisturbed by space or time;"
5826,79,"the other that was a god, yea many gods,"
5827,79,"had voices more than all the winds, with power"
5828,79,"to exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe,"
5829,79,"through every clime, the heart of human kind,"
5830,79,"while this was uttering, strange as it may seem,"
5831,79,"i wondered not, although i plainly saw"
5832,79,"the one to be a stone, the other a shell;"
5833,79,"nor doubted once but that they both were books,"
5834,79,"having a perfect faith in all that passed,"
5835,79,"far stronger, now, grew the desire i felt"
5836,79,to cleave unto this man; but when i prayed
5837,79,"to share his enterprise, he hurried on"
5838,79,"reckless of me, i followed, not unseen,"
5839,79,"for oftentimes he cast a backward look,"
5840,79,"grasping his twofold treasure,--lance in rest,"
5841,79,"he rode, i keeping pace with him; and now"
5842,79,"he, to my fancy, had become the knight"
5843,79,"whose tale cervantes tells; yet not the knight,"
5844,79,but was an arab of the desert too;
5845,79,"of these was neither, and was both at once,"
5846,79,"his countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed;"
5847,79,"and, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyes"
5848,79,"saw, over half the wilderness diffused,"
5849,79,"a bed of glittering light, i asked the cause,"
5850,79,"it is, said he, the waters of the deep"
5851,79,gathering upon us; quickening then the pace
5852,79,"of the unwieldy creature he bestrode,"
5853,79,"he left me, i called after him aloud;"
5854,79,"he heeded not; but, with his twofold charge"
5855,79,"still in his grasp, before me, full in view,"
5856,79,"went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste,"
5857,79,with the fleet waters of a drowning world
5858,79,"in chase of him; whereat i waked in terror,"
5859,79,"and saw the sea before me, and the book,"
5860,79,"in which i had been reading, at my side,"
5861,79,
5862,79,"full often, taking from the world of sleep"
5863,79,"this arab phantom, which i thus beheld,"
5864,79,"this semi-quixote, i to him have given"
5865,79,"a substance, fancied him a living man,"
5866,79,"a gentle dweller in the desert, crazed"
5867,79,"by love and feeling, and internal thought"
5868,79,protracted among endless solitudes;
5869,79,have shaped him wandering upon this quest!
5870,79,nor have i pitied him; but rather felt
5871,79,reverence was due to a being thus employed;
5872,79,"and thought that, in the blind and awful lair"
5873,79,"of such a madness, reason did lie couched,"
5874,79,enow there are on earth to take in charge
5875,79,"their wives, their children, and their virgin loves,"
5876,79,or whatsoever else the heart holds dear;
5877,79,"enow to stir for these; yea, will i say,"
5878,79,contemplating in soberness the approach
5879,79,"of an event so dire, by signs in earth"
5880,79,"or heaven made manifest, that i could share"
5881,79,"that maniac's fond anxiety, and go"
5882,79,"upon like errand, oftentimes at least"
5883,79,"me hath such strong entrancement overcome,"
5884,79,"when i have held a volume in my hand,"
5885,79,"poor earthly casket of immortal verse,"
5886,79,"shakespeare, or milton, labourers divine!"
5887,79,
5888,79,"great and benign, indeed, must be the power"
5889,79,"of living nature, which could thus so long"
5890,79,detain me from the best of other guides
5891,79,"and dearest helpers, left unthanked, unpraised,"
5892,79,even in the time of lisping infancy;
5893,79,"and later down, in prattling childhood even,"
5894,79,"while i was travelling back among those days,"
5895,79,how could i ever play an ingrate's part?
5896,79,"once more should i have made those bowers resound,"
5897,79,by intermingling strains of thankfulness
5898,79,with their own thoughtless melodies; at least
5899,79,it might have well beseemed me to repeat
5900,79,"some simply fashioned tale, to tell again,"
5901,79,"in slender accents of sweet verse, some tale"
5902,79,"that did bewitch me then, and soothes me now,"
5903,79,"o friend! o poet! brother of my soul,"
5904,79,think not that i could pass along untouched
5905,79,"by these remembrances, yet wherefore speak?"
5906,79,why call upon a few weak words to say
5907,79,what is already written in the hearts
5908,79,of all that breathe?--what in the path of all
5909,79,"drops daily from the tongue of every child,"
5910,79,wherever man is found? the trickling tear
5911,79,upon the cheek of listening infancy
5912,79,"proclaims it, and the insuperable look"
5913,79,"that drinks as if it never could be full,"
5914,79,
5915,79,that portion of my story i shall leave
5916,79,"there registered, whatever else of power"
5917,79,"or pleasure sown, or fostered thus, may be"
5918,79,"peculiar to myself, let that remain"
5919,79,"where still it works, though hidden from all search"
5920,79,"among the depths of time, yet is it just"
5921,79,"that here, in memory of all books which lay"
5922,79,"their sure foundations in the heart of man,"
5923,79,"whether by native prose, or numerous verse, 0"
5924,79,that in the name of all inspired souls--
5925,79,"from homer the great thunderer, from the voice"
5926,79,"that roars along the bed of jewish song,"
5927,79,"and that more varied and elaborate,"
5928,79,those trumpet-tones of harmony that shake
5929,79,"our shores in england,--from those loftiest notes"
5930,79,"down to the low and wren-like warblings, made"
5931,79,"for cottagers and spinners at the wheel,"
5932,79,"and sun-burnt travellers resting their tired limbs,"
5933,79,"stretched under wayside hedge-rows, ballad tunes,"
5934,79,"food for the hungry ears of little ones,"
5935,79,and of old men who have survived their joys--
5936,79,"'tis just that in behalf of these, the works,"
5937,79,"and of the men that framed them, whether known"
5938,79,"or sleeping nameless in their scattered graves,"
5939,79,"that i should here assert their rights, attest"
5940,79,"their honours, and should, once for all, pronounce"
5941,79,their benediction; speak of them as powers
5942,79,"for ever to be hallowed; only less,"
5943,79,"for what we are and what we may become,"
5944,79,"than nature's self, which is the breath of god,"
5945,79,"or his pure word by miracle revealed,"
5946,79,
5947,79,rarely and with reluctance would i stoop
5948,79,"to transitory themes; yet i rejoice,"
5949,79,"and, by these thoughts admonished, will pour out"
5950,79,"thanks with uplifted heart, that i was reared"
5951,79,safe from an evil which these days have laid
5952,79,"upon the children of the land, a pest"
5953,79,"that might have dried me up, body and soul,"
5954,79,"this verse is dedicate to nature's self,"
5955,79,"and things that teach as nature teaches, then,"
5956,79,"oh! where had been the man, the poet where,"
5957,79,"where had we been, we two, beloved friend!"
5958,79,"if in the season of unperilous choice,"
5959,79,"in lieu of wandering, as we did, through vales"
5960,79,"rich with indigenous produce, open ground"
5961,79,"of fancy, happy pastures ranged at will,"
5962,79,"we had been followed, hourly watched, and noosed,"
5963,79,each in his several melancholy walk
5964,79,"stringed like a poor man's heifer at its feed,"
5965,79,led through the lanes in forlorn servitude;
5966,79,or rather like a stalled ox debarred
5967,79,"from touch of growing grass, that may not taste"
5968,79,a flower till it have yielded up its sweets
5969,79,"a prelibation to the mower's scythe,"
5970,79,
5971,79,"behold the parent hen amid her brood,"
5972,79,"though fledged and feathered, and well pleased to part"
5973,79,"and straggle from her presence, still a brood,"
5974,79,and she herself from the maternal bond
5975,79,still undischarged; yet doth she little more
5976,79,"than move with them in tenderness and love,"
5977,79,a centre to the circle which they make;
5978,79,"and now and then, alike from need of theirs"
5979,79,"and call of her own natural appetites,"
5980,79,"she scratches, ransacks up the earth for food,"
5981,79,"which they partake at pleasure, early died"
5982,79,"my honoured mother, she who was the heart"
5983,79,"and hinge of all our learnings and our loves,"
5984,79,"she left us destitute, and, as we might,"
5985,79,"trooping together, little suits it me"
5986,79,to break upon the sabbath of her rest
5987,79,with any thought that looks at others' blame;
5988,79,"nor would i praise her but in perfect love,"
5989,79,"hence am i checked, but let me boldly say,"
5990,79,"in gratitude, and for the sake of truth,"
5991,79,"unheard by her, that she, not falsely taught,"
5992,79,"fetching her goodness rather from times past,"
5993,79,"than shaping novelties for times to come,"
5994,79,"had no presumption, no such jealousy,"
5995,79,nor did by habit of her thoughts mistrust
5996,79,"our nature, but had virtual faith that he"
5997,79,"who fills the mother's breast with innocent milk,"
5998,79,"doth also for our nobler part provide,"
5999,79,"under his great correction and control,"
6000,79,"as innocent instincts, and as innocent food;"
6001,79,"or draws, for minds that are left free to trust"
6002,79,"in the simplicities of opening life,"
6003,79,"sweet honey out of spurned or dreaded weeds,"
6004,79,"this was her creed, and therefore she was pure"
6005,79,"from anxious fear of error or mishap,"
6006,79,"and evil, overweeningly so called;"
6007,79,"was not puffed up by false unnatural hopes,"
6008,79,"nor selfish with unnecessary cares,"
6009,79,nor with impatience from the season asked
6010,79,more than its timely produce; rather loved
6011,79,"the hours for what they are, than from regard"
6012,79,"glanced on their promises in restless pride,"
6013,79,such was she--not from faculties more strong
6014,79,"than others have, but from the times, perhaps,"
6015,79,"and spot in which she lived, and through a grace"
6016,79,"of modest meekness, simple-mindedness,"
6017,79,"a heart that found benignity and hope,"
6018,79,"being itself benign,"
6019,79,my drift i fear
6020,79,"is scarcely obvious; but, that common sense"
6021,79,"may try this modern system by its fruits,"
6022,79,leave let me take to place before her sight
6023,79,"a specimen pourtrayed with faithful hand,"
6024,79,"full early trained to worship seemliness,"
6025,79,this model of a child is never known
6026,79,to mix in quarrels; that were far beneath 0
6027,79,its dignity; with gifts he bubbles o'er
6028,79,as generous as a fountain; selfishness
6029,79,"may not come near him, nor the little throng"
6030,79,of flitting pleasures tempt him from his path;
6031,79,"the wandering beggars propagate his name,"
6032,79,"dumb creatures find him tender as a nun,"
6033,79,"and natural or supernatural fear,"
6034,79,"unless it leap upon him in a dream,"
6035,79,"touches him not, to enhance the wonder, see"
6036,79,"how arch his notices, how nice his sense"
6037,79,of the ridiculous; not blind is he
6038,79,"to the broad follies of the licensed world,"
6039,79,"yet innocent himself withal, though shrewd,"
6040,79,and can read lectures upon innocence;
6041,79,"a miracle of scientific lore,"
6042,79,"ships he can guide across the pathless sea,"
6043,79,and tell you all their cunning; he can read
6044,79,"the inside of the earth, and spell the stars;"
6045,79,he knows the policies of foreign lands;
6046,79,"can string you names of districts, cities, towns,"
6047,79,"the whole world over, tight as beads of dew"
6048,79,"upon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs;"
6049,79,all things are put to question; he must live
6050,79,knowing that he grows wiser every day
6051,79,"or else not live at all, and seeing too"
6052,79,each little drop of wisdom as it falls
6053,79,"into the dimpling cistern of his heart,"
6054,79,"for this unnatural growth the trainer blame,"
6055,79,"pity the tree,--poor human vanity,"
6056,79,"wert thou extinguished, little would be left"
6057,79,which he could truly love; but how escape?
6058,79,"for, ever as a thought of purer birth"
6059,79,"rises to lead him toward a better clime,"
6060,79,some intermeddler still is on the watch
6061,79,"to drive him back, and pound him, like a stray,"
6062,79,"within the pinfold of his own conceit,"
6063,79,meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to find
6064,79,"the playthings, which her love designed for him,"
6065,79,"unthought of, in their woodland beds the flowers"
6066,79,"weep, and the river sides are all forlorn,"
6067,79,oh! give us once again the wishing-cap
6068,79,"of fortunatus, and the invisible coat"
6069,79,"of jack the giant-killer, robin hood,"
6070,79,"and sabra in the forest with st, george!"
6071,79,"the child, whose love is here, at least, doth reap"
6072,79,"one precious gain, that he forgets himself,"
6073,79,
6074,79,"these mighty workmen of our later age,"
6075,79,"who, with a broad highway, have overbridged"
6076,79,"the froward chaos of futurity,"
6077,79,tamed to their bidding; they who have the skill
6078,79,"to manage books, and things, and make them act"
6079,79,on infant minds as surely as the sun
6080,79,"deals with a flower; the keepers of our time,"
6081,79,"the guides and wardens of our faculties,"
6082,79,sages who in their prescience would control
6083,79,"all accidents, and to the very road"
6084,79,"which they have fashioned would confine us down,"
6085,79,"like engines; when will their presumption learn,"
6086,79,that in the unreasoning progress of the world
6087,79,"a wiser spirit is at work for us,"
6088,79,"a better eye than theirs, most prodigal"
6089,79,"of blessings, and most studious of our good,"
6090,79,even in what seem our most unfruitful hours?
6091,79,
6092,79,"there was a boy, ye knew him well, ye cliffs"
6093,79,and islands of winander!--many a time
6094,79,"at evening, when the earliest stars began"
6095,79,"to move along the edges of the hills,"
6096,79,"rising or setting, would he stand alone"
6097,79,"beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake,"
6098,79,
6099,79,"and there, with fingers interwoven, both hands"
6100,79,"pressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouth"
6101,79,"uplifted, he, as through an instrument,"
6102,79,"blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,"
6103,79,that they might answer him; and they would shout
6104,79,"across the watery vale, and shout again,"
6105,79,"responsive to his call, with quivering peals,"
6106,79,"and long halloos and screams, and echoes loud,"
6107,79,"redoubled and redoubled, concourse wild"
6108,79,"of jocund din; and, when a lengthened pause"
6109,79,"of silence came and baffled his best skill,"
6110,79,"then sometimes, in that silence while he hung"
6111,79,"listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise"
6112,79,has carried far into his heart the voice
6113,79,of mountain torrents; or the visible scene
6114,79,"would enter unawares into his mind,"
6115,79,"with all its solemn imagery, its rocks,"
6116,79,"its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received"
6117,79,"into the bosom of the steady lake,"
6118,79,
6119,79,"this boy was taken from his mates, and died"
6120,79,"in childhood, ere he was full twelve years old,"
6121,79,"fair is the spot, most beautiful the vale"
6122,79,where he was born; the grassy churchyard hangs
6123,79,"upon a slope above the village school,"
6124,79,and through that churchyard when my way has led
6125,79,"on summer evenings, i believe that there"
6126,79,a long half hour together i have stood
6127,79,"mute, looking at the grave in which he lies!"
6128,79,even now appears before the mind's clear eye
6129,79,that self-same village church; i see her sit
6130,79,the throned lady whom erewhile we hailed 0
6131,79,"on her green hill, forgetful of this boy"
6132,79,"who slumbers at her feet,--forgetful, too,"
6133,79,"of all her silent neighbourhood of graves,"
6134,79,and listening only to the gladsome sounds
6135,79,"that, from the rural school ascending, play"
6136,79,"beneath her and about her, may she long"
6137,79,behold a race of young ones like to those
6138,79,"with whom i herded!--easily, indeed,"
6139,79,we might have fed upon a fatter soil
6140,79,of arts and letters--but be that forgiven--
6141,79,"a race of real children; not too wise,"
6142,79,"too learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh,"
6143,79,and bandied up and down by love and hate;
6144,79,not unresentful where self-justified;
6145,79,"fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy;"
6146,79,mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds;
6147,79,"though doing wrong and suffering, and full oft"
6148,79,bending beneath our life's mysterious weight
6149,79,"of pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not"
6150,79,"in happiness to the happiest upon earth,"
6151,79,"simplicity in habit, truth in speech,"
6152,79,be these the daily strengtheners of their minds;
6153,79,may books and nature be their early joy!
6154,79,"and knowledge, rightly honoured with that name--"
6155,79,knowledge not purchased by the loss of power!
6156,79,
6157,79,well do i call to mind the very week
6158,79,when i was first intrusted to the care
6159,79,"of that sweet valley; when its paths, its shores,"
6160,79,and brooks were like a dream of novelty
6161,79,"to my half-infant thoughts; that very week,"
6162,79,"while i was roving up and down alone,"
6163,79,"seeking i knew not what, i chanced to cross"
6164,79,"one of those open fields, which, shaped like ears,"
6165,79,"make green peninsulas on esthwaite's lake,"
6166,79,"twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom"
6167,79,appeared distinctly on the opposite shore
6168,79,"a heap of garments, as if left by one"
6169,79,"who might have there been bathing, long i watched,"
6170,79,but no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake
6171,79,"grew dark with all the shadows on its breast,"
6172,79,"and, now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped"
6173,79,"the breathless stillness, the succeeding day,"
6174,79,those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale
6175,79,drew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked
6176,79,"in passive expectation from the shore,"
6177,79,"while from a boat others hung o'er the deep,"
6178,79,"sounding with grappling irons and long poles,"
6179,79,"at last, the dead man, 'mid that beauteous scene"
6180,79,"of trees and hills and water, bolt upright"
6181,79,"rose, with his ghastly face, a spectre shape"
6182,79,"of terror; yet no soul-debasing fear,"
6183,79,"young as i was, a child not nine years old,"
6184,79,"possessed me, for my inner eye had seen"
6185,79,"such sights before, among the shining streams"
6186,79,"of faery land, the forest of romance,"
6187,79,their spirit hallowed the sad spectacle
6188,79,with decoration of ideal grace;
6189,79,"a dignity, a smoothness, like the works"
6190,79,"of grecian art, and purest poesy,"
6191,79,
6192,79,"a precious treasure had i long possessed,"
6193,79,"a little yellow, canvas-covered book,"
6194,79,a slender abstract of the arabian tales;
6195,79,"and, from companions in a new abode,"
6196,79,"when first i learnt, that this dear prize of mine"
6197,79,was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry--
6198,79,"that there were four large volumes, laden all"
6199,79,"with kindred matter, 'twas to me, in truth,"
6200,79,"a promise scarcely earthly, instantly,"
6201,79,"with one not richer than myself, i made"
6202,79,a covenant that each should lay aside
6203,79,"the moneys he possessed, and hoard up more,"
6204,79,till our joint savings had amassed enough
6205,79,"to make this book our own, through several months,"
6206,79,"in spite of all temptation, we preserved"
6207,79,"religiously that vow; but firmness failed,"
6208,79,"nor were we ever masters of our wish,"
6209,79,
6210,79,and when thereafter to my father's house
6211,79,"the holidays returned me, there to find"
6212,79,"that golden store of books which i had left,"
6213,79,what joy was mine! how often in the course
6214,79,"of those glad respites, though a soft west wind"
6215,79,"ruffled the waters to the angler's wish,"
6216,79,"for a whole day together, have i lain"
6217,79,"down by thy side, o derwent! murmuring stream,"
6218,79,"on the hot stones, and in the glaring sun,"
6219,79,"and there have read, devouring as i read,"
6220,79,"defrauding the day's glory, desperate!"
6221,79,"till with a sudden bound of smart reproach,"
6222,79,"such as an idler deals with in his shame,"
6223,79,"i to the sport betook myself again,"
6224,79,
6225,79,"a gracious spirit o'er this earth presides,"
6226,79,and o'er the heart of man; invisibly
6227,79,"it comes, to works of unreproved delight,"
6228,79,"and tendency benign, directing those"
6229,79,"who care not, know not, think not, what they do,"
6230,79,the tales that charm away the wakeful night
6231,79,"in araby, romances; legends penned"
6232,79,for solace by dim light of monkish lamps;
6233,79,"fictions, for ladies of their love, devised"
6234,79,"by youthful squires; adventures endless, spun 0"
6235,79,"by the dismantled warrior in old age,"
6236,79,out of the bowels of those very schemes
6237,79,in which his youth did first extravagate;
6238,79,"these spread like day, and something in the shape"
6239,79,"of these will live till man shall be no more,"
6240,79,"dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours,"
6241,79,"and 'they must' have their food, our childhood sits,"
6242,79,"our simple childhood, sits upon a throne"
6243,79,"that hath more power than all the elements,"
6244,79,"i guess not what this tells of being past,"
6245,79,nor what it augurs of the life to come;
6246,79,"but so it is; and, in that dubious hour--"
6247,79,that twilight--when we first begin to see
6248,79,"this dawning earth, to recognise, expect,"
6249,79,"and, in the long probation that ensues,"
6250,79,"the time of trial, ere we learn to live"
6251,79,in reconcilement with our stinted powers;
6252,79,"to endure this state of meagre vassalage,"
6253,79,"unwilling to forego, confess, submit,"
6254,79,"uneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows"
6255,79,"to custom, mettlesome, and not yet tamed"
6256,79,"and humbled down--oh! then we feel, we feel,"
6257,79,"we know where we have friends, ye dreamers, then,"
6258,79,"forgers of daring tales! we bless you then,"
6259,79,"impostors, drivellers, dotards, as the ape"
6260,79,"philosophy will call you, 'then' we feel"
6261,79,"with what, and how great might ye are in league,"
6262,79,"who make our wish, our power, our thought a deed,"
6263,79,"an empire, a possession,--ye whom time"
6264,79,and seasons serve; all faculties to whom
6265,79,"earth crouches, the elements are potter's clay,"
6266,79,"space like a heaven filled up with northern lights,"
6267,79,"here, nowhere, there, and everywhere at once,"
6268,79,
6269,79,relinquishing this lofty eminence
6270,79,"for ground, though humbler, not the less a tract"
6271,79,"of the same isthmus, which our spirits cross"
6272,79,in progress from their native continent
6273,79,"to earth and human life, the song might dwell"
6274,79,"on that delightful time of growing youth,"
6275,79,when craving for the marvellous gives way
6276,79,to strengthening love for things that we have seen;
6277,79,"when sober truth and steady sympathies,"
6278,79,"offered to notice by less daring pens,"
6279,79,"take firmer hold of us, and words themselves"
6280,79,"move us with conscious pleasure,"
6281,79,i am sad
6282,79,at thought of rapture now for ever flown;
6283,79,almost to tears i sometimes could be sad
6284,79,"to think of, to read over, many a page,"
6285,79,"poems withal of name, which at that time"
6286,79,"did never fail to entrance me, and are now"
6287,79,"dead in my eyes, dead as a theatre"
6288,79,"fresh emptied of spectators, twice five years"
6289,79,"or less i might have seen, when first my mind"
6290,79,with conscious pleasure opened to the charm
6291,79,"of words in tuneful order, found them sweet"
6292,79,"for their own 'sakes', a passion, and a power;"
6293,79,"and phrases pleased me chosen for delight,"
6294,79,"for pomp, or love, oft, in the public roads"
6295,79,"yet unfrequented, while the morning light"
6296,79,"was yellowing the hill tops, i went abroad"
6297,79,"with a dear friend, and for the better part"
6298,79,of two delightful hours we strolled along
6299,79,"by the still borders of the misty lake,"
6300,79,"repeating favourite verses with one voice,"
6301,79,"or conning more, as happy as the birds"
6302,79,"that round us chaunted, well might we be glad,"
6303,79,"lifted above the ground by airy fancies,"
6304,79,more bright than madness or the dreams of wine;
6305,79,"and, though full oft the objects of our love"
6306,79,"were false, and in their splendour overwrought,"
6307,79,yet was there surely then no vulgar power
6308,79,"working within us,--nothing less, in truth,"
6309,79,"than that most noble attribute of man,"
6310,79,"though yet untutored and inordinate,"
6311,79,"that wish for something loftier, more adorned,"
6312,79,"than is the common aspect, daily garb,"
6313,79,"of human life, what wonder, then, if sounds"
6314,79,of exultation echoed through the groves!
6315,79,"for, images, and sentiments, and words,"
6316,79,and everything encountered or pursued
6317,79,"in that delicious world of poesy,"
6318,79,"kept holiday, a never-ending show,"
6319,79,"with music, incense, festival, and flowers!"
6320,79,
6321,79,"here must we pause, this only let me add,"
6322,79,"from heart-experience, and in humblest sense"
6323,79,"of modesty, that he, who in his youth"
6324,79,a daily wanderer among woods and fields
6325,79,"with living nature hath been intimate,"
6326,79,not only in that raw unpractised time
6327,79,"is stirred to ecstasy, as others are,"
6328,79,"by glittering verse; but further, doth receive,"
6329,79,"in measure only dealt out to himself,"
6330,79,knowledge and increase of enduring joy
6331,79,from the great nature that exists in works
6332,79,"of mighty poets, visionary power"
6333,79,"attends the motions of the viewless winds,"
6334,79,"embodied in the mystery of words,"
6335,79,"there, darkness makes abode, and all the host"
6336,79,"of shadowy things work endless changes,--there,"
6337,79,"as in a mansion like their proper home, 0"
6338,79,even forms and substances are circumfused
6339,79,"by that transparent veil with light divine,"
6340,79,"and, through the turnings intricate of verse,"
6341,79,"present themselves as objects recognised,"
6342,79,"in flashes, and with glory not their own,"
6343,80,a rock there is whose homely front
6344,80,    the passing traveller slights;
6345,80,"yet there the glow-worms hang their lamps,"
6346,80,"    like stars, at various heights;"
6347,80,and one coy primrose to that rock
6348,80,"    the vernal breeze invites,"
6349,80,"what hideous warfare hath been waged,"
6350,80,"    what kingdoms overthrown,"
6351,80,since first i spied that primrose-tuft
6352,80,   and marked it for my own;
6353,80,a lasting link in nature's chain
6354,80,   from highest heaven let down!
6355,80,
6356,80,"the flowers, still faithful to the stems,"
6357,80,   their fellowship renew;
6358,80,"the stems are faithful to the root,"
6359,80,   that worketh out of view;
6360,80,and to the rock the root adheres
6361,80,"   in every fibre true,"
6362,80,
6363,80,"close clings to earth the living rock,"
6364,80,"   though threatening still to fall,"
6365,80,the earth is constant to her sphere;
6366,80,"   and god upholds them all,"
6367,80,"so blooms this lonely plant, nor dreads"
6368,80,"   her annual funeral,"
6369,80,
6370,80,here closed the meditative strain;
6371,80,"   but air breathed soft that day,"
6372,80,"the hoary mountain-heights were cheered,"
6373,80,   the sunny vale looked gay;
6374,80,and to the primrose of the rock
6375,80,"   i gave this after-lay,"
6376,80,
6377,80,"i sang-let myriads of bright flowers,"
6378,80,"   like thee, in field and grove"
6379,80,"revive unenvied;-mightier far,"
6380,80,   than tremblings that reprove
6381,80,"our vernal tendencies to hope,"
6382,80,   is god's redeeming love;
6383,80,
6384,80,"that love which changed-for wan disease,"
6385,80,   for sorrow that had bent
6386,80,"o'er hopeless dust, for withered age-"
6387,80,"   their moral element,"
6388,80,and turned the thistles of a curse
6389,80,"   to types beneficent,"
6390,80,
6391,80,"sin-blighted though we are, we too,"
6392,80,"   the reasoning sons of men,"
6393,80,from one oblivious winter called
6394,80,"   shall rise, and breathe again;"
6395,80,and in eternal summer lose
6396,80,"   our threescore years and ten,"
6397,80,
6398,80,to humbleness of heart descends
6399,80,"   this prescience from on high,"
6400,80,"the faith that elevates the just,"
6401,80,   before and when they die;
6402,80,and makes each soul a separate heaven
6403,80,"   a court for deity,"
6404,81,my heart leaps up when i behold
6405,81,"              a rainbow in the sky,"
6406,81,so was it when my life began;
6407,81,"so be it when i shall grow old,"
6408,81,               or let me die!
6409,81,the child is father of the man;
6410,81,and i wish my days to be
6411,81,"bound each to each by natural piety,"
6412,82,"behold her, single in the field,"
6413,82,yon solitary highland lass!
6414,82,reaping and singing by herself;
6415,82,"stop here, or gently pass!"
6416,82,"alone she cuts and binds the grain,"
6417,82,and sings a melancholy strain;
6418,82,o listen! for the vale profound
6419,82,"is overflowing with the sound,"
6420,82,
6421,82,no nightingale did ever chaunt
6422,82,more welcome notes to weary bands
6423,82,"of travellers in some shady haunt,"
6424,82,"among arabian sands,"
6425,82,a voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
6426,82,in spring-time from the cuckoo-bird
6427,82,breaking the silence of the seas
6428,82,"among the farthest hebrides,"
6429,82,
6430,82,will no one tell me what she sings?
6431,82,perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
6432,82,"for old, unhappy, far-off things,"
6433,82,"and battles long ago,"
6434,82,"or is it some more humble lay,"
6435,82,familiar matter of today?
6436,82,"some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,"
6437,82,"that has been, and may be again!"
6438,82,
6439,82,"whate'er the theme, the maiden sang"
6440,82,as if her song could have no ending;
6441,82,"i saw her singing at her work,"
6442,82,and o'er the sickle bending;
6443,82,"i listened, motionless and still;"
6444,82,and as i mounted up the hill
6445,82,"the music in my heart i bore,"
6446,82,"long after it was heard no more,"
6447,83,"at the corner of wood street, when daylight appears,"
6448,83,"hangs a thrush that sings loud, it has sung for three years,"
6449,83,"poor susan has passed by the spot, and has heard"
6450,83,"in the silence of morning the song of the bird,"
6451,83,'tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? she sees
6452,83,"a mountain ascending, a vision of trees;"
6453,83,"bright volumes of vapour through lothbury glide,"
6454,83,"and a river flows on through the vale of cheapside,"
6455,83,"green pastures she views in the midst of the dale,"
6456,83,down which she so often has tripped with her pail;
6457,83,"and a single small cottage, a nest like a dove's,"
6458,83,"the one only dwelling on earth that she loves,"
6459,83,
6460,83,"  she looks, and her heart is in heaven, but they fade,"
6461,83,"  the mist and the river, the hill and the shade,"
6462,83,"  the stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise,"
6463,83,  and the colours have all passed away from her eyes!
6464,84,i
6465,84,
6466,84,"enough of rose-bud lips, and eyes"
6467,84,"    like harebells bathed in dew,"
6468,84,"of cheek that with carnation vies,"
6469,84,    and veins of violet hue;
6470,84,earth wants not beauty that may scorn
6471,84,    a likening to frail flowers;
6472,84,"yea, to the stars, if they were born"
6473,84,"    for seasons and for hours,"
6474,84,
6475,84,"through moscow's gates, with gold unbarred,"
6476,84,"    stepped one at dead of night,"
6477,84,whom such high beauty could not guard
6478,84,    from meditated blight;
6479,84,"by stealth she passed, and fled as fast"
6480,84,"    as doth the hunted fawn,"
6481,84,"nor stopped, till in the dappling east"
6482,84,"    appeared unwelcome dawn,"
6483,84,
6484,84,"seven days she lurked in brake and field,"
6485,84,"    seven nights her course renewed,"
6486,84,"sustained by what her scrip might yield,"
6487,84,    or berries of the wood;
6488,84,"at length, in darkness travelling on,"
6489,84,"    when lowly doors were shut,"
6490,84,"the haven of her hope she won,"
6491,84,"    her foster-mother's hut,"
6492,84,
6493,84,to put your love to dangerous proof
6494,84,"    i come, said she, from far;"
6495,84,"for i have left my father's roof,"
6496,84,"    in terror of the czar,"
6497,84,"no answer did the matron give,"
6498,84,"    no second look she cast,"
6499,84,"but hung upon the fugitive,"
6500,84,"    embracing and embraced,"
6501,84,
6502,84,she led the lady to a seat
6503,84,"    beside the glimmering fire,"
6504,84,"bathed duteously her wayworn feet,"
6505,84,"    prevented each desire,---"
6506,84,"the cricket chirped, the house-dog dozed,"
6507,84,"    and on that simple bed,"
6508,84,"where she in childhood had reposed,"
6509,84,"    now rests her weary head,"
6510,84,
6511,84,"when she, whose couch had been the sod,"
6512,84,"    whose curtain, pine or thorn,"
6513,84,"had breathed a sigh of thanks to god,"
6514,84,    who comforts the forlorn;
6515,84,while over her the matron bent
6516,84,"    sleep sealed her eyes, and stole"
6517,84,"feeling from limbs with travel spent,"
6518,84,"    and trouble from the soul,"
6519,84,
6520,84,"refreshed, the wanderer rose at morn,"
6521,84,    and soon again was dight
6522,84,in those unworthy vestments worn
6523,84,    through long and perilous flight;
6524,84,"and o beloved nurse, she said,"
6525,84,    my thanks with silent tears
6526,84,"have unto heaven and you been paid,"
6527,84,    now listen to my fears !
6528,84,
6529,84,have you forgot---and here she smiled---
6530,84,    the babbling flatteries
6531,84,you lavished on me when a child
6532,84,    disporting round your knees?
6533,84,"i was your lambkin, and your bird,"
6534,84,"    your star, your gem, your flower;"
6535,84,"light words, that were more lightly heard"
6536,84,    in many a cloudless hour!
6537,84,
6538,84,the blossom you so fondly praised
6539,84,    is come to bitter fruit;
6540,84,a mighty one upon me gazed;
6541,84,"    i spurned his lawless suit,"
6542,84,"and must be hidden from his wrath,"
6543,84,"    you, foster-father dear,"
6544,84,will guide me in my forward path;
6545,84,    i may not tarry here!
6546,84,
6547,84,i cannot bring to utter woe
6548,84,"    your proved fidelity,---"
6549,84,"dear child, sweet mistress, say not so!"
6550,84,"    for you we both would die,"
6551,84,"nay, nay, i come with semblance feigned"
6552,84,    and cheek embrowned by art;
6553,84,"yet, being inwardly unstained,"
6554,84,"    with courage will depart,"
6555,84,
6556,84,"but whither would you, could you, flee?"
6557,84,    a poor man's counsel take;
6558,84,the holy virgin gives to me
6559,84,    a thought for your dear sake;
6560,84,"rest, shielded by our lady's grace,"
6561,84,    and soon shall you be led
6562,84,"forth to a safe abiding-place,"
6563,84,"    where never foot doth tread,"
6564,84,
6565,84,ii
6566,84,the dwelling of this faithful pair
6567,84,"    in a straggling village stood,"
6568,84,for one who breathed unquiet air
6569,84,    a dangerous neighbourhood;
6570,84,but wide around lay forest ground
6571,84,    with thickets rough and blind;
6572,84,and pine-trees made a heavy shade
6573,84,"    impervious to the wind,"
6574,84,
6575,84,"and there, sequestered from the eight,"
6576,84,"    was spread a treacherous swamp,"
6577,84,on which the noonday sun shed light
6578,84,    as from a lonely lamp;
6579,84,"and midway in the unsafe morass,"
6580,84,    a single island rose
6581,84,"of firm dry ground, with healthful grass"
6582,84,"    adorned, and shady boughs,"
6583,84,
6584,84,"the woodman knew, for such the craft"
6585,84,"    this russian vassal plied,"
6586,84,"that never fowler's gun, nor shaft"
6587,84,"    of archer, there was tried;"
6588,84,a sanctuary seemed the spot
6589,84,    from all intrusion free;
6590,84,and there he planned an artful cot
6591,84,"    for perfect secrecy,"
6592,84,
6593,84,with earnest pains unchecked by dread
6594,84,"    of power's far-stretching hand,"
6595,84,the bold good man his labor sped
6596,84,    at nature's pure command;
6597,84,"heart-soothed, and busy as a wren,"
6598,84,"    while, in a hollow nook,"
6599,84,she moulds her sight-eluding den
6600,84,"    above a murmuring brook,"
6601,84,
6602,84,"his task accomplished to his mind,"
6603,84,    the twain ere break of day
6604,84,"creep forth, and through the forest wind"
6605,84,    their solitary way;
6606,84,"few words they speak, nor dare to slack"
6607,84,"    their pace from mile to mile,"
6608,84,"till they have crossed the quaking marsh,"
6609,84,"    and reached the lonely isle,"
6610,84,
6611,84,the sun above the pine-trees showed
6612,84,    a bright and cheerful face;
6613,84,"and ina looked for her abode,"
6614,84,    the promised hiding-place;
6615,84,"she sought in vain, the woodman smiled;"
6616,84,"    no threshold could be seen,"
6617,84,"nor roof, nor window;ñall seemed wild"
6618,84,"    as it had ever been,"
6619,84,
6620,84,"advancing, you might guess an hour,"
6621,84,    the front with such nice care
6622,84,"is masked, 'if house it be or bower,'"
6623,84,    but in they entered are;
6624,84,as shaggy as were wall and roof
6625,84,"    with branches intertwined,"
6626,84,"so smooth was all within, air-proof,"
6627,84,"    and delicately lined,"
6628,84,
6629,84,"and hearth was there, and maple dish,"
6630,84,"    and cups in seemly rows,"
6631,84,and couch---all ready to a wish
6632,84,    for nurture or repose;
6633,84,and heaven doth to her virtue grant
6634,84,    that here she may abide
6635,84,"in solitude, with every want"
6636,84,"    by cautious love supplied,"
6637,84,
6638,84,"no queen, before a shouting crowd,"
6639,84,"    led on in bridal state,"
6640,84,"e'er struggled with a heart so proud,"
6641,84,"    entering her palace gate,"
6642,84,"rejoiced to bid the world farewell,"
6643,84,    no saintly anchoress
6644,84,e'er took possession of her cell
6645,84,"    with deeper thankfulness,"
6646,84,
6647,84,"father of all, upon thy care"
6648,84,    and mercy am i thrown;
6649,84,be thou my safeguard!---such her prayer
6650,84,"    when she was left alone,"
6651,84,kneeling amid the wilderness
6652,84,"    when joy had passed away,"
6653,84,"and smiles, fond efforts of distress"
6654,84,    to hide what they betray!
6655,84,
6656,84,"the prayer is heard, the saints have seen,"
6657,84,"    diffused through form and face,"
6658,84,resolves devotedly serene;
6659,84,    that monumental grace
6660,84,"of faith, which doth all passions tame"
6661,84,    that reason should control;
6662,84,and shows in the untrembling frame
6663,84,"    a statue of the soul,"
6664,84,
6665,84,iii
6666,84,'tis sung in ancient minstrelsy
6667,84,    that phoebus wont to wear
6668,84,the leaves of any pleasant tree
6669,84,    around his golden hair;
6670,84,"till daphne, desperate with pursuit"
6671,84,"    of his imperious love,"
6672,84,"at her own prayer transformed, took root,"
6673,84,"    a laurel in the grove,"
6674,84,
6675,84,then did the penitent adorn
6676,84,    his brow with laurel green;
6677,84,and 'mid his bright locks never shorn
6678,84,    no meaner leaf was seen;
6679,84,"and poets sage, through every age,"
6680,84,    about their temples wound
6681,84,"the bay; and conquerors thanked the gods,"
6682,84,"    with laurel chaplets crowned,"
6683,84,
6684,84,into the mists of fabling time
6685,84,    so far runs back the praise
6686,84,"of beauty, that disdains to climb"
6687,84,    along forbidden ways;
6688,84,that scorns temptation; power defies
6689,84,    where mutual love is not;
6690,84,and to the tomb for rescue flies
6691,84,"    when life would be a blot,"
6692,84,
6693,84,"to this fair votaress, a fate"
6694,84,    more mild doth heaven ordain
6695,84,upon her island desolate;
6696,84,"    and word, not breathed in vain,"
6697,84,"might tell what intercourse she found,"
6698,84,    her silence to endear;
6699,84,"what birds she tamed, what flowers the ground"
6700,84,"    sent forth her peace to cheer,"
6701,84,
6702,84,"to one mute presence, above all,"
6703,84,"    her soothed affections clung,"
6704,84,a picture on the cabin wall
6705,84,    by russian usage hung---
6706,84,"the mother-maid, whose countenance bright"
6707,84,    with love abridged the day;
6708,84,"and, communed with by taper light,"
6709,84,"    chased spectral fears away,"
6710,84,
6711,84,"and oft as either guardian came,"
6712,84,    the joy in that retreat
6713,84,"might any common friendship shame,"
6714,84,    so high their heart would beat;
6715,84,"and to the lone recluse, whate'er"
6716,84,"    they brought, each visiting"
6717,84,was like the crowding of the year
6718,84,"    with a new burst of spring,"
6719,84,
6720,84,"but, when she of her parents thought,"
6721,84,    the pang was hard to bear;
6722,84,"and, if with all things not enwrought,"
6723,84,"    that trouble still is near,"
6724,84,before her flight she had not dared
6725,84,"    their constancy to prove,"
6726,84,too much the heroic daughter feared
6727,84,"    the weakness of their love,"
6728,84,
6729,84,"dark is the past to them, and dark"
6730,84,"    the future still must be,"
6731,84,till pitying saints conduct her bark
6732,84,    into a safer sea---
6733,84,"or gentle nature close her eyes,"
6734,84,    and set her spirit free
6735,84,"from the altar of this sacrifice,"
6736,84,"    in vestal purity,"
6737,84,
6738,84,"yet, when above the forest-glooms"
6739,84,"    the white swans southward passed,"
6740,84,high as the pitch of their swift plume
6741,84,    her fancy rode the blast;
6742,84,and bore her toward the fields of france
6743,84,"    her father's native land,"
6744,84,"to mingle in the rustic dance,"
6745,84,     the happiest of the band!
6746,84,
6747,84,of those beloved fields she oft
6748,84,    had heard her father tell
6749,84,in phrase that now with echoes soft
6750,84,    haunted her lonely cell;
6751,84,"she saw the hereditary bowers,"
6752,84,    she heard the ancestral stream;
6753,84,the kremlin and its haughty towers
6754,84,    forgotten like a dream !
6755,84,
6756,84,iv
6757,84,the ever-changing moon had traced
6758,84,"    twelve times her monthly round,"
6759,84,when through the unfrequented waste
6760,84,    was heard a startling sound;
6761,84,a shout thrice sent from one who chased
6762,84,"    at speed a wounded deer,"
6763,84,"bounding through branches interlaced,"
6764,84,"    and where the wood was clear,"
6765,84,
6766,84,"the fainting creature took the marsh,"
6767,84,"    and toward the island fled,"
6768,84,while plovers screamed with tumult harsh
6769,84,    above his antlered head;
6770,84,"this, ina saw; and, pale with fear,"
6771,84,    shrunk to her citadel;
6772,84,"the desperate deer rushed on, and near"
6773,84,"    the tangled covert fell,"
6774,84,
6775,84,"across the marsh, the game in view,"
6776,84,"    the hunter followed fast,"
6777,84,"nor paused, till o'er the stag he blew"
6778,84,    a death-proclaiming blast;
6779,84,"then, resting on her upright mind,"
6780,84,    came forth the maid---in me
6781,84,"behold, she said,  a stricken hind"
6782,84,    pursued by destiny!
6783,84,
6784,84,"from your deportment, sir! i deem"
6785,84,"    that you have worn a sword,"
6786,84,and will not hold in light esteem
6787,84,    a suffering woman's word;
6788,84,"there is my covert, there perchance"
6789,84,"    i might have lain concealed,"
6790,84,"my fortunes hid, my countenance"
6791,84,"    not even to you revealed,"
6792,84,
6793,84,"tears might be shed, and i might pray,"
6794,84,"    crouching and terrified,"
6795,84,"that what has been unveiled to day,"
6796,84,    you would in mystery hide;
6797,84,but i will not defile with dust
6798,84,    the knee that bend to adore
6799,84,"the god in heaven;---attend, be just;"
6800,84,"    this ask i, and no more!"
6801,84,
6802,84,"i speak not of the winter's cold,"
6803,84,"    for summer's heat exchanged,"
6804,84,"while i have lodged in this rough hold,"
6805,84,    from social life estranged;
6806,84,"nor yet of trouble and alarms,"
6807,84,    high heaven is my defence;
6808,84,and every season has soft arms
6809,84,"    for injured innocence,"
6810,84,
6811,84,from moscow to the wilderness
6812,84,"    it was my choice to come,"
6813,84,"lest virtue should be harborless,"
6814,84,    and honor want a home;
6815,84,"and happy were i, if the czar"
6816,84,"    retain his lawless will,"
6817,84,"to end life here like this poor deer,"
6818,84,"    or a lamb on a green hill,"
6819,84,
6820,84,"are you the maid, the stranger cried,"
6821,84,"    from gallic parents sprung,"
6822,84,"whose vanishing was rumored wide,"
6823,84,    sad theme for every tongue;
6824,84,who foiled an emperor's eager quest?
6825,84,"    you, lady, forced to wear"
6826,84,"these rude habiliments, and rest"
6827,84,    your head in this dark lair!
6828,84,
6829,84,"but wonder, pity, soon were quelled;"
6830,84,    and in her face and mien
6831,84,the soul's pure brightness she beheld
6832,84,"    without a veil between,"
6833,84,"he loved, he hoped,---a holy flame"
6834,84,    kindled 'mid rapturous tears;
6835,84,the passion of a moment came
6836,84,"    as on the wings of years,"
6837,84,
6838,84,"such bounty is no gift of chance,"
6839,84,"    exclaimed he; righteous heaven,"
6840,84,"preparing your deliverance,"
6841,84,"    to me the charge hath given,"
6842,84,"the czar full oft in words, and deeds"
6843,84,    is stormy and self-willed;
6844,84,"but, when the lady catherine pleads,"
6845,84,"    his violence is stilled,"
6846,84,
6847,84,"leave open to my wish the course,"
6848,84,    and i to her will go;
6849,84,"from that humane and heavenly source,"
6850,84,"    good, only good, can flow,''"
6851,84,"faint sanction given, the cavalier"
6852,84,"    was eager to depart,"
6853,84,"though question followed question, dear"
6854,84,"    to the maiden's filial heart,"
6855,84,
6856,84,"light was his step,---his hopes, more light,"
6857,84,    kept pace with his desires;
6858,84,and the fifth morning gave him sight
6859,84,"    of moscow's glittering spires,"
6860,84,"he sued,---heart-smitten by the wrong,"
6861,84,    to the lorn fugitive
6862,84,the emperor sent a pledge as strong
6863,84,"    as sovereign power could give,"
6864,84,
6865,84,o more than mighty change! if e'er
6866,84,"    amazement rose to pain,"
6867,84,and joy's excess produced a fear
6868,84,    of something void and vain;
6869,84,"'twas when the parents, who had mourned"
6870,84,"    so long the lost as dead,"
6871,84,"beheld their only child returned,"
6872,84,"    the household floor to tread,"
6873,84,
6874,84,soon gratitude gave way to love
6875,84,"    within the maiden's breast,"
6876,84,delivered and deliverer move
6877,84,    in bridal garments drest;
6878,84,meek catherine had her own reward;
6879,84,    the czar bestowed a dower;
6880,84,and universal moscow shared
6881,84,"    the triumph of that hour,"
6882,84,
6883,84,flowers strewed the ground; the nuptial feast
6884,84,    was held with costly state;
6885,84,"and there, 'mid many a noble guest,"
6886,84,    the foster-parent sate;
6887,84,"encouraged by the imperial eye,"
6888,84,    they shrank not into shade;
6889,84,"great as their bliss, the honor high"
6890,84,    to them and nature paid!
6891,85,",   one morning raw it was and wet---"
6892,85,   a foggy day in winter time
6893,85,"   a woman on the road i met,"
6894,85,"   not old, though something past her prime,"
6895,85,"   majestic in her person, tall and straight;"
6896,85,"and like a roman matron's was her mien and gait,"
6897,85,
6898,85,   the ancient spirit is not dead;
6899,85,"   old times, thought i, are breathing there;"
6900,85,   proud was i that my country bred
6901,85,"   such strength, a dignity so fair,"
6902,85,"   she begged an alms, like one in poor estate;"
6903,85,"i looked at her again, nor did my pride abate,"
6904,85,
6905,85,"   when from these lofty thoughts i woke,"
6906,85,"   what is it, said i, that you bear,"
6907,85,"   beneath the covert of your cloak,"
6908,85,   protected from this cold damp air? 
6909,85,"   she answered, soon as she the question heard,"
6910,85,"a simple burthen, sir, a little singing-bird,"
6911,85,
6912,85,"   and, thus continuing, she said,"
6913,85,"   i had a son, who many a day"
6914,85,"   sailed on the seas, but he is dead;"
6915,85,"   in denmark he was cast away,"
6916,85,   and i have travelled weary miles to see
6917,85,"if aught which he had owned might still remain for me,"
6918,85,
6919,85,"   the bird and cage they both were his,"
6920,85,   'twas my son's bird; and neat and trim
6921,85,"   he kept it, many voyages"
6922,85,   the singing-bird had gone with him;
6923,85,"   when last he sailed, he left the bird behind;"
6924,85,"from boding's, as might be, that hung upon his mind,"
6925,85,
6926,85,   he to a fellow-lodger's care
6927,85,"   had left it, to be watched and fed,"
6928,85,   and pipe its song in safety;---there
6929,85,   i found it when my son was dead;
6930,85,"   and now, god help me for my little wit!"
6931,85,"i bear it with me, sir;---he took so much delight in it,"
6932,86,"or, the solitude of binnorie"

6934,86,"seven daughter had lord archibald,"
6935,86,"all children of one mother,"

6958,86,"beside a grotto of their own,"
6959,86,"with boughs above them closing,"

6962,86,"but now, upstarting with affright"
6963,86,"at noise of man and steed,"
6964,86,"away they fly to left, to rightñ"
6965,86,"of your fair household, father-knight,"
6966,86,methinks you take small heed!
6967,86,"    sing, mournfully, oh! mournfully,"
6968,86,    the solitude of binnorie!
6969,86,
6970,86,"away the even fair campbells fly,"
6971,86,"and, over hill and hollow,"
6972,86,"with menace proud, and insult loud,"
6973,86,"the youthful rovers follow,"
6974,86,"cried they, your father loves to roam,"
6975,86,enough for him to find
6976,86,the empty house when he comes home;
6977,86,"for us your yellow ringlets comb,"
6978,86,for us be fair and kind!

6981,86,
6982,86,"some close behind, some side to side,"
6983,86,like clouds in stormy weather;
6984,86,"they run, and cry, nay, let us die,"
6985,86,"and let us die together,"
6986,86,a lake was near; the shore was steep;
6987,86,there never foot had been;
6988,86,"they ran, and with a desperate leap"
6989,86,"together plunged into the deep,"
6990,86,"nor ever more were seen,"
6991,86,"    sing, mournfully, oh! mournfully,"

6993,86,
6994,86,"the stream that flows out of the lake,"
6995,86,"as through the glen it rambles,"
6996,86,"repeats a moan o'er moss and stone,"
6997,86,"for those seven lovely campbells,"
6998,86,"seven little islands, green and bare,"
6999,86,"have risen from out the deep,"
7000,86,"the fishers say, those sisters fair,"
7001,86,"by faeries all are buried there,"

7005,87,"the shepherd, looking eastward, softly said,"
7006,87,"bright is thy veil, o moon, as thou art bright!"
7007,87,"forthwith, that little cloud, in ether spread"
7008,87,"and penetrated all with tender light,"
7009,87,"she cast away, and showed her fulgent head"

7012,87,"her beauty thoughtlessly disparaged,"
7013,87,"meanwhile that veil, removed or thrown aside,"
7014,87,"went floating from her, darkening as it went;"
7015,87,"and a huge mass, to bury or to hide,"
7016,87,approached this glory of the firmament;
7017,87,"who meekly yields, and is obscured--content"
7018,87,"with one calm triumph of a modest pride,"
7019,88,",         --brook and road"
7020,88,"   were fellow-travellers in this gloomy pass,"
7021,88,   and with them did we journey several hours
7022,88,"   at a slow step, the immeasurable height"
7023,88,"   of woods decaying, never to be decayed,"
7024,88,"   the stationary blasts of waterfalls,"
7025,88,"   and in the narrow rent, at every turn,"
7026,88,"   winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn,"
7027,88,"   the torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,"
7028,88,"  the rocks that muttered close upon our ears,"
7029,88,  black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside
7030,88,"  as if a voice were in them, the sick sight"
7031,88,"  and giddy prospect of the raving stream,"
7032,88,"  the unfettered clouds and region of the heavens,"
7033,88,"  tumult and peace, the darkness and the light--"
7034,88,"  were all like workings of one mind, the features"
7035,88,"  of the same face, blossoms upon one tree,"
7036,88,"  characters of the great apocalypse,"
7037,88,"  the types and symbols of eternity,"
7038,88,"  of first and last, and midst, and without end,"
7039,89,",   behold her, single in the field,"
7040,89,    yon solitary highland lass!
7041,89,    reaping and singing by herself;
7042,89,"    stop here, or gently pass!"
7043,89,"    alone she cuts and binds the grain,"
7044,89,    and sings a melancholy strain;
7045,89,    o listen! for the vale profound
7046,89,"    is overflowing with the sound,"
7047,89,
7048,89,    no nightingale did ever chaunt
7049,89,    more welcome notes to weary bands
7050,89,"    of travellers in some shady haunt,"
7051,89,"    among arabian sands,"
7052,89,    a voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
7053,89,"    in spring-time from the cuckoo-bird,"
7054,89,    breaking the silence of the seas
7055,89,"    among the farthest hebrides,"
7056,89,
7057,89,    will no one tell me what she sings?--
7058,89,    perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
7059,89,"    for old, unhappy, far-off things,"
7060,89,"    and battles long ago,"
7061,89,"    or is it some more humble lay,"
7062,89,    familiar matter of to-day?
7063,89,"    some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,"
7064,89,"    that has been, and may be again?"
7065,89,
7066,89,"    whate'er the theme, the maiden sang"
7067,89,    as if her song could have no ending;
7068,89,"    i saw her singing at her work,"
7069,89,    and o'er the sickle bending;--
7070,89,"    i listened, motionless and still;"
7071,89,"    and, as i mounted up the hill,"
7072,89,"    the music in my heart i bore,"
7073,89,"    long after it was heard no more,"
7074,90,"behold, within the leafy shade,"
7075,90,those bright blue eggs together laid!
7076,90,on me the chance-discovered sight
7077,90,"gleamed like a vision of delight,"
7078,90,i started---seeming to espy
7079,90,"the home and sheltered bed,"
7080,90,"the sparrow's dwelling, which, hard by"
7081,90,"my father' house, in wet or dry"
7082,90,my sister emmeline and i
7083,90,"       together visited,"
7084,90,
7085,90,she looked at it and seemed to fear it;
7086,90,"dreading, tho' wishing, to be near it,"
7087,90,"such heart was in her, being then"
7088,90,"a little prattler among men,"
7089,90,the blessing of my later year
7090,90,"was with me when a boy,"
7091,90,"she gave me eyes, she gave me ears;"
7092,90,"and humble care, and delicate fears;"
7093,90,"a heart, the fountain of sweet tears;"
7094,90,"       and love, and thought, and joy,"
7095,91,"the sun has long been set,"
7096,91,"the stars are out by twos and threes,"
7097,91,the little birds are piping yet
7098,91,among the bushes and the trees;
7099,91,"there's a cuckoo, and one or two thrushes,"
7100,91,"and a far-off wind that rushes,"
7101,91,"and a sound of water that gushes,"
7102,91,and the cuckoo's sovereign cry
7103,91,"fills all the hollow of the sky,"
7104,91,who would go `parading'
7105,91,"in london, `and masquerading',"
7106,91,on such a night of june
7107,91,"with that beautiful soft half-moon,"
7108,91,and all these innocent blisses?
7109,91,on such a night as this is!
7110,92,",    up! up! my friend, and quit your books;"
7111,92,"   or surely you'll grow double,"
7112,92,"   up! up! my friend, and clear your looks;"
7113,92,   why all this toil and trouble?
7114,92,"   the sun above the mountain's head,"
7115,92,   a freshening lustre mellow
7116,92,"   through all the long green fields has spread,"
7117,92,"   his first sweet evening yellow,"
7118,92,"   books! 'tis a dull and endless strife,"
7119,92,"  come, hear the woodland linnet,"
7120,92,"  how sweet his music! on my life,"
7121,92,"  there's more of wisdom in it,"
7122,92,
7123,92,  and hark! how blithe the throstle sings!
7124,92,"  he, too, is no mean preacher,"
7125,92,"  come forth into the light of things,"
7126,92,"  let nature be your teacher,"
7127,92,
7128,92,"  she has a world of ready wealth,"
7129,92,  our minds and hearts to bless--
7130,92,"  spontaneous wisdom breathed by health,"
7131,92,"  truth breathed by cheerfulness,"
7132,92,
7133,92,  one impulse from a vernal wood
7134,92,"  may teach you more of man,"
7135,92,"  of moral evil and of good,"
7136,92,"  than all the sages can,"
7137,92,
7138,92,  sweet is the lore which nature brings;
7139,92,  our meddling intellect
7140,92,"  mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things,--"
7141,92,"  we murder to dissect,"
7142,92,
7143,92,  enough of science and of art;
7144,92,  close up those barren leaves;
7145,92,"  come forth, and bring with you a heart"
7146,92,"  that watches and receives,"
7147,93,"we walked along, while bright and red"
7148,93,uprose the morning sun;
7149,93,"and matthew stopped, he looked, and said"
7150,93,`the will of god be done!'
7151,93,
7152,93,"a village schoolmaster was he,"
7153,93,with hair of glittering grey;
7154,93,as blithe a man as you could see
7155,93,"on a spring holiday,"
7156,93,
7157,93,"and on that morning, through the grass"
7158,93,and by the steaming rills
7159,93,"we travelled merrily, to pass"
7160,93,"a day among the hills,"
7161,93,
7162,93,"`our work,' said i, `was well begun;"
7163,93,"then, from thy breast what thought,"
7164,93,"beneath so beautiful a sun,"
7165,93,so sad a sigh has brought?'
7166,93,
7167,93,a second time did matthew stop;
7168,93,and fixing still his eye
7169,93,"upon the eastern mountain-top,"
7170,93,"to me he made reply,"
7171,93,
7172,93,`yon cloud with that long purple cleft
7173,93,brings fresh into my mind
7174,93,"a day like this, which i have left"
7175,93,"full thirty years behind,"
7176,93,
7177,93,`and just above yon slope of corn
7178,93,"such colours, and no other,"
7179,93,"were in the sky, that april morn,"
7180,93,"of this the very brother,"
7181,93,
7182,93,`with rod and line i sued the sport
7183,93,"which that sweet season gave,"
7184,93,"and, to the churchyard come, stopped short"
7185,93,"beside my daughter's grave,"
7186,93,
7187,93,"`nine summers had she scarcely seen,"
7188,93,the pride of all the vale;
7189,93,"and then she sang, -she would have been"
7190,93,"a very nightingale,"
7191,93,
7192,93,`six feet in earth my emma lay;
7193,93,and yet i loved her more -
7194,93,"for so it seemed, -than till that day"
7195,93,"i e'er had loved before,"
7196,93,
7197,93,"`and turning from her grave, i met"
7198,93,beside the churchyard yew
7199,93,"a blooming girl, whose hair was wet"
7200,93,"with points of morning dew,"
7201,93,
7202,93,`a basket on her head she bare;
7203,93,"her brow was smooth and white,"
7204,93,"to see a child so very fair,"
7205,93,it was a pure delight!
7206,93,
7207,93,`no fountain from its rocky cave
7208,93,e'er tripped with foot so free;
7209,93,she seemed as happy as a wave
7210,93,"that dances on the sea,"
7211,93,
7212,93,`there came from me a sigh of pain
7213,93,which i could ill confine;
7214,93,"i looked at her, and looked again,"
7215,93,and did not wish her mine!'
7216,93,
7217,93,"- matthew is in his grave, yet now"
7218,93,methinks i see him stand
7219,93,"as that moment, with a bough"
7220,93,"of wilding in his hand,"
7221,94,",   mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrost"
7222,94,"   with the least shade of thought to sin allied,"
7223,94,"   woman! above all women glorified,"
7224,94,   our tainted nature's solitary boast;
7225,94,   purer than foam on central ocean tost;
7226,94,   brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewn
7227,94,"   with fancied roses, than the unblemished moon"
7228,94,   before her wane begins on heaven's blue coast;
7229,94,"   thy image falls to earth, yet some, i ween,"
7230,94,"  not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend,"
7231,94,"  as to a visible power, in which did blend"
7232,94,  all that was mixed and reconciled in thee
7233,94,"  of mother's love with maiden purity,"
7234,94,"  of high with low, celestial with terrene!"
7235,95,"[in the vale of grasmere, by the side of an old highway"
7236,95,"leading to ambleside, is a gate, which, from time out of"
7237,95,"mind, has been called the wishing-gate, from a belief that"
7238,95,"wishes formed or indulged there have a favorable issue,]"
7239,95,
7240,95,"hope rules a land forever green,"
7241,95,all powers that serve the bright-eyed queen

7243,95,clouds at her bidding disappear;
7244,95,"points she to aught?---the bliss draws near,"
7245,95,"       and fancy smooths the way,"
7246,95,
7247,95,not such the land of wishes---there
7248,95,"dwell fruitless day-dreams, lawless prayer,"
7249,95,    and thoughts with things at strife;
7250,95,"yet how forlorn, should ye depart"
7251,95,"ye superstitions of the heart,"
7252,95,"    how poor, were human life!"
7253,95,
7254,95,"when magic lore abjured its might,"
7255,95,"ye did not forfeit one dear right,"
7256,95,    one tender claim abate;
7257,95,"witness this symbol of your sway,"
7258,95,"surnving near the public way,"
7259,95,    the rustic wishing-gate!
7260,95,
7261,95,inquire not if the faery race
7262,95,"shed kindly influence on the place,"
7263,95,    ere northward they retired;
7264,95,"if here a warrior left a spell,"
7265,95,panting for glory as he fell;
7266,95,"    or here a saint expired,"
7267,95,
7268,95,"enough that all around is fair,"
7269,95,"composed with nature's finest care,"
7270,95,    and in her fondest love---
7271,95,peace to embosom and content---
7272,95,"to overawe the turbulent,"
7273,95,"    the selfish to reprove,"
7274,95,
7275,95,"yea! even the stranger from afar,"
7276,95,"reclining on this moss-grown bar,"
7277,95,"    unknowing, and unknown,"
7278,95,"the infection of the ground partakes,"
7279,95,longing for his beloved---who maker
7280,95,"    all happiness her own,"
7281,95,
7282,95,then why should conscious spirits fear
7283,95,"the mystic stirrings that are here,"
7284,95,    the ancient faith disclaim?
7285,95,the local genius ne'er befriends
7286,95,"desires whose course in folly ends,"
7287,95,"    whose just reward is shame,"
7288,95,
7289,95,"smile if thou wilt, but not in scorn,"
7290,95,"if some, by ceaseless pains outworn,"
7291,95,    here crave an easier lot;
7292,95,if some have thirsted to renew
7293,95,"a broken vow, or bind a true,"
7294,95,"    with firmer, holier knot,"
7295,95,
7296,95,"and not in vain, when thoughts are cast"
7297,95,"upon the irrevocable past,"
7298,95,    some penitent sincere
7299,95,"may for a worthier future sigh,"
7300,95,while trickles from his downcast eye
7301,95,"    no unavailing tear,"
7302,95,
7303,95,"the worldling, pining to be freed"
7304,95,"from turmoil, who would turn or speed"
7305,95,"    the current of his fate,"
7306,95,"might stop before this favored scene,"
7307,95,"at nature's call, nor blush to lean"
7308,95,"    upon the wishing-gate,"

7310,95,"the sage, who feels how blind, how weak"
7311,95,"is man, though loth such help to seek,"

7313,95,and thirst for insight to allay
7314,95,"misgiving, while the crimson day"
7315,95,    in quietness withdraws;
7316,95,
7317,95,or when the church-clock's knell profound
7318,95,to time's first step across the bound
7319,95,    of midnight makes reply;
7320,95,"time pressing on with starry crest,"
7321,95,to filial sleep upon the breast
7322,95,"    of dread eternity,"
7323,96,"the world is too much with us; late and soon,"
7324,96,"getting and spending, we lay waste our powers,"
7325,96,little we see in nature that is ours;
7326,96,"we have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!"
7327,96,this sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
7328,96,"the winds that will be howling at all hours,"
7329,96,and are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
7330,96,"for this, for everything, we are out of tune,"
7331,96,"it moves us not,--great god! i'd rather be"
7332,96,a pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
7333,96,"so might i, standing on this pleasant lea,"
7334,96,have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
7335,96,    have sight of proteus rising from the sea;
7336,96,"    or hear old triton blow his wreathed horn,"
7337,97,"there is an eminence,--of these our hills"
7338,97,the last that parleys with the setting sun;
7339,97,we can behold it from our orchard-seat;
7340,97,"and, when at evening we pursue out walk"
7341,97,"along the public way, this peak, so high"
7342,97,"above us, and so distant in its height,"
7343,97,is visible; and often seems to send
7344,97,"its own deep quiet to restore our hearts,"
7345,97,"the meteors make of it a favourite haunt,"
7346,97,"the star of jove, so beautiful and large"
7347,97,"in the mid heavens, is never half so fair"
7348,97,"as when he shines above it, 'tis in truth"
7349,97,"the loneliest place we have among the clouds,"
7350,97,"and she who dwells with me, whom i have loved"
7351,97,"with such communion, that no place on earth"
7352,97,"can ever be a solitude to me,"
7353,97,"hath to this lonely summit given my name,"
7354,98,", there was a boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs"
7355,98,"  and islands of winander! many a time,"
7356,98,"  at evening, when the earliest stars began"
7357,98,"   to move along the edges of the hills,"
7358,98,"   rising or setting, would he stand alone,"
7359,98,"   beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake;"
7360,98,"   and there, with fingers interwoven, both hands"
7361,98,   pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth
7362,98,"   uplifted, he, as through an instrument,"
7363,98,  blew mimic hootings to the silent owls
7364,98,"  that they might answer him,--and they would shout"
7365,98,"  across the watery vale, and shout again,"
7366,98,"  responsive to his call,--with quivering peals,"
7367,98,"  and long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud"
7368,98,  redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild
7369,98,"  of jocund din! and, when there came a pause"
7370,98,"  of silence such as baffled his best skill,"
7371,98,"  then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung"
7372,98,"  listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise"
7373,98,  has carried far into his heart the voice
7374,98,  of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene
7375,98,  would enter unawares into his mind
7376,98,"  with all its solemn imagery, its rocks,"
7377,98,"  its woods, and that uncertain heaven received"
7378,98,"  into the bosom of the steady lake,"
7379,98,
7380,98,"  this boy was taken from his mates, and died"
7381,98,"  in childhood, ere he was full twelve years old,"
7382,98,  pre-eminent in beauty is the vale
7383,98,"  where he was born and bred, the churchyard hangs"
7384,98,  upon a slope above the village-school;
7385,98,  and through that churchyard when my way has led
7386,98,"  on summer-evenings, i believe that there"
7387,98,  a long half-hour together i have stood
7388,98,  mute--looking at the grave in which he lies!
7389,99,stay near me---do not take thy flight!
7390,99,a little longer stay in sight!
7391,99,"much converse do i find i thee,"
7392,99,historian of my infancy !
7393,99,float near me; do not yet depart!
7394,99,"dead times revive in thee,"
7395,99,"thou bring'st, gay creature as thou art!"
7396,99,"a solemn image to my heart,"
7397,99,my father's family!
7398,99,
7399,99,"oh! pleasant, pleasant were the days,"
7400,99,"the time, when, in our childish plays,"
7401,99,my sister emmeline and i
7402,99,together chased the butterfly!
7403,99,a very hunter did i rush
7404,99,"upon the prey,---with leaps and spring"
7405,99,i followed on from brake to bush;
7406,99,"but she, god love her, feared to brush"
7407,99,"the dust from off its wings,"
7408,100,",   sweet highland girl, a very shower"
7409,100,   of beauty is thy earthly dower!
7410,100,   twice seven consenting years have shed
7411,100,"   their utmost bounty on thy head,"
7412,100,   and these grey rocks; that household lawn;
7413,100,"   those trees, a veil just half withdrawn;"
7414,100,   this fall of water that doth make
7415,100,   a murmur near the silent lake;
7416,100,   this little bay; a quiet road
7417,100,  that holds in shelter thy abode--
7418,100,  in truth together do ye seem
7419,100,  like something fashioned in a dream;
7420,100,  such forms as from their covert peep
7421,100,  when earthly cares are laid asleep!
7422,100,"  but, o fair creature! in the light"
7423,100,"  of common day, so heavenly bright,"
7424,100,"  i bless thee, vision as thou art,"
7425,100,  i bless thee with a human heart;
7426,100,  god shield thee to thy latest years!
7427,100,"  thee, neither know i, nor thy peers;"
7428,100,"  and yet my eyes are filled with tears,"
7429,100,
7430,100,     with earnest feeling i shall pray
7431,100,"  for thee when i am far away,"
7432,100,"  for never saw i mien, or face,"
7433,100,  in which more plainly i could trace
7434,100,  benignity and home-bred sense
7435,100,"  ripening in perfect innocence,"
7436,100,"  here scattered, like a random seed,"
7437,100,"  remote from men, thou dost not need"
7438,100,"  the embarrassed look of shy distress,"
7439,100,"  and maidenly shamefacedness,"
7440,100,  thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear
7441,100,"  the freedom of a mountaineer,"
7442,100,  a face with gladness overspread!
7443,100,"  soft smiles, by human kindness bred!"
7444,100,"  and seemliness complete, that sways"
7445,100,"  thy courtesies, about thee plays;"
7446,100,"  with no restraint, but such as springs"
7447,100,  from quick and eager visitings
7448,100,  of thoughts that lie beyond the reach
7449,100,"  of thy few words of english speech,"
7450,100,"  a bondage sweetly brooked, a strife"
7451,100,  that gives thy gestures grace and life!
7452,100,"  so have i, not unmoved in mind,"
7453,100,  seen birds of tempest-loving kind--
7454,100,"  thus beating up against the wind,"
7455,100,
7456,100,     what hand but would a garland cull
7457,100,  for thee who art so beautiful?
7458,100,  o happy pleasure! here to dwell
7459,100,  beside thee in some heathy dell;
7460,100,"  adopt your homely ways, and dress,"
7461,100,"  a shepherd, thou a shepherdess!"
7462,100,  but i could frame a wish for thee
7463,100,"  more like a grave reality,"
7464,100,  thou art to me but as a wave
7465,100,  of the wild sea; and i would have
7466,100,"  some claim upon thee, if i could,"
7467,100,"  though but of common neighbourhood,"
7468,100,"  what joy to hear thee, and to see!"
7469,100,"  thy elder brother i would be,"
7470,100,  thy father--anything to thee!
7471,100,
7472,100,     now thanks to heaven! that of its grace
7473,100,"  hath led me to this lonely place,"
7474,100,  joy have i had; and going hence
7475,100,"  i bear away my recompense,"
7476,100,  in spots like these it is we prize
7477,100,"  our memory, feel that she hath eyes,"
7478,100,"  then, why should i be loth to stir?"
7479,100,  i feel this place was made for her;
7480,100,"  to give new pleasure like the past,"
7481,100,"  continued long as life shall last,"
7482,100,"  nor am i loth, though pleased at heart,"
7483,100,  sweet highland girl! from thee to part;
7484,100,"  for i, methinks, till i grow old,"
7485,100,"  as fair before me shall behold,"
7486,100,"  as i do now, the cabin small,"
7487,100,"  the lake, the bay, the waterfall;"
7488,100,"  and thee, the spirit of them all!"
7489,101,up with me! up with me into the clouds!
7490,101,"for thy song, lark, is strong;"
7491,101,"up with me, up with me into the clouds!"
7492,101,"singing, singing,"
7493,101,"with clouds and sky about thee ringing,"
7494,101,"lift me, guide me till i find"
7495,101,that spot which seems so to thy mind!
7496,101,
7497,101,i have walked through wildernesses dreary
7498,101,and to-day my heart is weary;
7499,101,"had i now the wings of a faery,"
7500,101,"up to thee would i fly,"
7501,101,"there is madness about thee, and joy divine"
7502,101,in that song of thine;
7503,101,"lift me, guide me high and high"
7504,101,"to thy banqueting-place in the sky,"
7505,101,
7506,101,joyous as morning
7507,101,thou art laughing and scorning;
7508,101,"thou hast a nest for thy love and thy rest,"
7509,101,"and, though little troubled with sloth,"
7510,101,drunken lark! thou would'st be loth
7511,101,"to be such a traveller as i,"
7512,101,"happy, happy liver,"
7513,101,with a soul as strong as a mountain river
7514,101,"pouring out praise to the almighty giver,"
7515,101,joy and jollity be with us both!
7516,101,
7517,101,"alas! my journey, rugged and uneven,"
7518,101,through prickly moors or dusty ways must wind;
7519,101,"but hearing thee, or others of thy kind,"
7520,101,"as full of gladness and as free of heaven,"
7521,101,"i, with my fate contented, will plod on,"
7522,101,"and hope for higher raptures, when life's day is done,"
7523,102,ethereal minstrel! pilgrim of the sky!
7524,102,dost thou despise the earth where cares abound?
7525,102,"or, while the wings aspire, are heart and eye"
7526,102,both with thy nest upon the dewy ground?
7527,102,"thy nest which thou canst drop into at will,"
7528,102,"those quivering wings composed, that music still!"
7529,102,leave to the nightingale her shady wood;
7530,102,a privacy of glorious light is thine;
7531,102,whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
7532,102,"of harmony, with instinct more divine;"
7533,102,"type of the wise who soar, but never roam;"
7534,102,true to the kindred points of heaven and home!
7535,103,though many suns have risen and set
7536,103,"    since thou, blithe may, wert born,"
7537,103,"and bards, who hailed thee, may forget"
7538,103,"    thy gift, thy beauty scorn;"
7539,103,there are who to a birthday strain
7540,103,"    confine not harp and voice,"
7541,103,but evermore throughout thy reign
7542,103,    are grateful and rejoice!
7543,103,
7544,103,"delicious odor! music sweet,"
7545,103,    too sweet to pass away!
7546,103,oh for a deathless song to meet
7547,103,    the soul's desire---a lay
7548,103,"that, when a thousand year are told,"
7549,103,"    should praise thee, genial power!"
7550,103,"through summer heat, autumnal cold,"
7551,103,"    and winter's dreariest hour,"
7552,103,
7553,103,"earth, sea, thy presence feel---nor less,"
7554,103,    if yon ethereal blue
7555,103,"with its soft smile the truth express,"
7556,103,"    the heavens have felt it too,"
7557,103,the inmost heart of man if glad
7558,103,    partakes a livelier cheer;
7559,103,and eye that cannot but be sad
7560,103,"    let fall a brightened tear,"
7561,103,
7562,103,"since thy return, through days and weeks"
7563,103,"    of hope that grew by stealth,"
7564,103,how many wan and faded cheeks
7565,103,    have kindled into health!
7566,103,"the old, by thee revived, have said,"
7567,103,    another year is ours;
7568,103,"and wayworn wanderers, poorly fed,"
7569,103,"    have smiled upon thy flowers,"
7570,103,
7571,103,who tripping lisps a merry song
7572,103,    amid his playful peers?
7573,103,the tender infant who was long
7574,103,    a prisoner of fond fears;
7575,103,"but now, when every sharp-edged blast"
7576,103,"    is quiet in its sheath,"
7577,103,his mother leaves him free to taste
7578,103,"    earth's sweetness in thy breath,"
7579,103,
7580,103,thy help is with the weed that creeps
7581,103,    along the humblest ground;
7582,103,no cliff so bare but on its steeps
7583,103,    thy favors may be found;
7584,103,but most on some peculiar nook
7585,103,"    that our own hands have drest,"
7586,103,"thou and thy train are proud to look,"
7587,103,"    and seem to love it best,"
7588,103,
7589,103,and yet how pleased we wander forth
7590,103,"    when may is whispering, come!"
7591,103,choose from the bowers of virgin earth
7592,103,    the happiest for your home;
7593,103,heavenõs bounteous love through me is spread
7594,103,"    from sunshine, clouds, winds, waves,"
7595,103,"drops on the mouldering turret's head,"
7596,103,    and on your turf-clad graves!
7597,103,
7598,103,"such greeting heard, away with sighs"
7599,103,"    for lilies that must fade,"
7600,103,or ' the rathe primrose as it dies
7601,103,    forsaken' in the shade!
7602,103,vernal fruitions and desires
7603,103,    are linked in endless chase;
7604,103,"while, as one kindly growth retires,"
7605,103,"    another takes its place,"
7606,103,
7607,103,"and what if thou, sweet may, hast known"
7608,103,    mishap by worm and blight;
7609,103,if expectations newly blown
7610,103,    have perished in thy sight;
7611,103,"if loves and joys, while up they sprung,"
7612,103,    were caught as in a snare;
7613,103,"such is the lot of all the young,"
7614,103,"    however bright and fair,"
7615,103,
7616,103,lo! streams that april could not check
7617,103,    are patient of thy rule;
7618,103,"gurgling in foamy water-break,"
7619,103,"    loitering in glassy pool,"
7620,103,"by thee, thee only, could be sent"
7621,103,"    such gentle mists as glide,"
7622,103,"curling with unconfirmed intent,"
7623,103,"    on that green mountain's side,"
7624,103,
7625,103,how delicate the leafy veil
7626,103,    through which yon house of god
7627,103,gleams 'mid the peace of this deep dale
7628,103,    by few but shepherds trod!
7629,103,"and lowly huts, near beaten ways,"
7630,103,    no sooner stand attired
7631,103,"in thy fresh wreaths, than they for praise"
7632,103,"    peep forth, and are admired,"
7633,103,
7634,103,"season of fancy and of hope,"
7635,103,"    permit not for one hour,"
7636,103,"a blossom from thy crown to drop,"
7637,103,    nor add to it a flower!
7638,103,"keep, lovely may, as if by touch"
7639,103,"    of self restraining art,"
7640,103,"this modest charm of not too much,"
7641,103,"    part seen, imagined part!"
7642,104,"o blithe new-comer! i have heard,"
7643,104,"i hear thee and rejoice,"
7644,104,"o cuckoo! shall i call thee bird,"
7645,104,or but a wandering voice?
7646,104,
7647,104,while i am lying on the grass
7648,104,"thy twofold shout i hear,"
7649,104,"from hill to hill it seems to pass,"
7650,104,"at once far off, and near,"
7651,104,
7652,104,"though babbling only to the vale,"
7653,104,"of sunshine and of flowers,"
7654,104,thou bringest unto me a tale
7655,104,"of visionary hours,"
7656,104,
7657,104,"thrice welcome, darling of the spring!"
7658,104,even yet thou art to me
7659,104,"no bird, but an invisible thing,"
7660,104,"a voice, a mystery;"
7661,104,
7662,104,the same whom in my school-boy days
7663,104,i listened to; that cry
7664,104,which made me look a thousand ways
7665,104,"in bush, and tree, and sky,"
7666,104,
7667,104,to seek thee did i often rove
7668,104,through woods and on the green;
7669,104,"and thou wert still a hope, a love;"
7670,104,"still longed for, never seen,"
7671,104,
7672,104,and i can listen to thee yet;
7673,104,can lie upon the plain
7674,104,"and listen, till i do beget"
7675,104,"that golden time again,"
7676,104,
7677,104,o blessed bird! the earth we pace
7678,104,again appears to be
7679,104,"an unsubstantial, faery place;"
7680,104,that is fit home for thee!
7681,105,in youth from rock to rock i went
7682,105,from hill to hill in discontent
7683,105,"of pleasure high and turbulent,"
7684,105,      most pleased when most uneasy;
7685,105,"but now my own delights i make,---"
7686,105,"thirst at every rill can slake,"
7687,105,"and gladly nature's love partake,"
7688,105,"      of thee, sweet daisy!"
7689,105,
7690,105,thee winter in the garland wears
7691,105,that thinly decks his few gray hairs;
7692,105,"spring parts the clouds with softest airs,"
7693,105,      that she may sun thee;
7694,105,whole summer-fields are thine by right;
7695,105,"and autumn, melancholy wight!"
7696,105,doth in thy crimson head delight
7697,105,"      when rains are on thee,"
7698,105,
7699,105,"in shoals and bands, a morrice train,"
7700,105,thou greet'st the traveller in the lane;
7701,105,pleased at his greeting thee again;
7702,105,"      yet nothing daunted,"
7703,105,"nor grieved if thou be set at nought,"
7704,105,and oft alone in nooks remote
7705,105,"we meet thee, like a pleasant thought,"
7706,105,"      when such are wanted,"
7707,105,
7708,105,be violets in their secret mews
7709,105,the flowers the wanton zephyrs choose;
7710,105,"proud be the rose, with rains and dew"
7711,105,"      her head impearling,"
7712,105,"thou liv'st with less ambitious aim,"
7713,105,yet hast not gone without thy fame;
7714,105,thou art indeed by many a claim
7715,105,"      the poet's darling,"
7716,105,
7717,105,"if to a rock from rain he fly,"
7718,105,"or, some bright day of april sky,"
7719,105,imprisoned by hot sunshine lie
7720,105,"      near the green holly,"
7721,105,and wearily at length should fare;
7722,105,"he need but look about, and there"
7723,105,"thou art!---a friend at hand, to care"
7724,105,"      his melancholy,"
7725,105,
7726,105,"a hundred times, by rock or bower,"
7727,105,"ere thus i have lain couched an hour,"
7728,105,have i derived from thy sweet power
7729,105,      some apprehension
7730,105,some steady love; some brief delight;
7731,105,some memory that had taken flight;
7732,105,some chime of fancy wrong or right;
7733,105,"      of stray invention,"
7734,105,
7735,105,"if stately passions in me burn,"
7736,105,"and one chance look to thee should turn,"
7737,105,i drink out of an humbler urn
7738,105,      a lowlier pleasure;
7739,105,the homely sympathy that heeds
7740,105,"the common life, our nature breeds;"
7741,105,a wisdom fitted to the needs
7742,105,"of hearts at leisure,"
7743,105,
7744,105,"fresh-smitten by the morning ray,"
7745,105,"when thou art up, alert and gay,"
7746,105,"then, cheerful flower! my spirits play"
7747,105,"      with kindred gladness,"
7748,105,"and when, at dusk, by dews opprest"
7749,105,"thou sink'st, the image of thy rest"
7750,105,hath often eased my pensive breast
7751,105,"      of careful sadness,"
7752,105,
7753,105,"and all day long i number yet,"
7754,105,"all seasons through, another debt,"
7755,105,"      which i, wherever thou art met,"
7756,105,to thee am owing;
7757,105,"an instinct call it, a blind sense;"
7758,105,"a happy, genial influence,"
7759,105,"coming one knows not how, nor whence,"
7760,105,"      nor whither going,"
7761,105,
7762,105,child of the year! that round dost run
7763,105,"thy pleasant course,---when day's begun"
7764,105,as ready to salute the sun
7765,105,"      as lark or leveret,"
7766,105,thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain;
7767,105,nor be less dear to future men
7768,105,than in old time;---thou not in vain
7769,105,"      art nature's favourite,"
7770,106,"--a simple child,"
7771,106,"that lightly draws its breath,"
7772,106,"and feels its life in every limb,"
7773,106,what should it know of death?
7774,106,
7775,106,"i met a little cottage girl,"
7776,106,"she was eight years old, she said;"
7777,106,her hair was thick with many a curl
7778,106,"that clustered round her head,"
7779,106,
7780,106,"she had a rustic, woodland air,"
7781,106,and she was wildly clad;
7782,106,"her eyes were fair, and very fair;"
7783,106,"--her beauty made me glad,"
7784,106,
7785,106,"sisters and brothers, little maid,"
7786,106,how many may you be?
7787,106,"how many? seven in all, she said,"
7788,106,"and wondering looked at me,"
7789,106,
7790,106,"and where are they? i pray you tell,"
7791,106,"she answered, seven are we;"
7792,106,"and two of us at conway dwell,"
7793,106,"and two are gone to sea,"
7794,106,
7795,106,"two of us in the churchyard lie,"
7796,106,my sister and my brother;
7797,106,"and in the churchyard cottage, i"
7798,106,"dwell near them with my mother,"
7799,106,
7800,106,"you say that two at conway dwell,"
7801,106,"and two are gone to sea,"
7802,106,"yet ye are seven! -- i pray you tell,"
7803,106,"sweet maid, how this may be,"
7804,106,
7805,106,"then did the little maid reply,"
7806,106,seven boys and girls are we;
7807,106,"two of us in the churchyard lie,"
7808,106,"beneath the churchyard tree,"
7809,106,
7810,106,"you run about, my little maid,"
7811,106,your limbs they are alive;
7812,106,"if two are in the churchyard laid,"
7813,106,"then ye are only five,"
7814,106,
7815,106,"their graves are green, they may be seen,"
7816,106,"the little maid replied,"
7817,106,"twelve steps or more from my mother's door,"
7818,106,"and they are side by side,"
7819,106,
7820,106,"my stockings there i often knit,"
7821,106,my kerchief there i hem;
7822,106,"and there upon the ground i sit,"
7823,106,"and sing a song to them,"
7824,106,
7825,106,"and often after sunset, sir,"
7826,106,"when it is light and fair,"
7827,106,"i take my little porringer,"
7828,106,"and eat my supper there,"
7829,106,
7830,106,the first that died was sister jane;
7831,106,"in bed she moaning lay,"
7832,106,till god released her of her pain;
7833,106,"and then she went away,"
7834,106,
7835,106,so in the churchyard she was laid;
7836,106,"and, when the grass was dry,"
7837,106,"together round her grave we played,"
7838,106,"my brother john and i,"
7839,106,
7840,106,"and when the ground was white with snow,"
7841,106,"and i could run and slide,"
7842,106,"my brother john was forced to go,"

7844,106,
7845,106,"how many are you, then, said i,"
7846,106,if they two are in heaven?
7847,106,"quick was the little maid's reply,"
7848,106,"o master! we are seven,"
7849,106,
7850,106,but they are dead; those two are dead!
7851,106,their spirits are in heaven!

7856,107,"how silently, and with how wan a face!"
7857,107,where art thou? thou so often seen on high
7858,107,running among the clouds a wood-nymph's race!
7859,107,"unhappy nuns, whose common breath's a sigh"
7860,107,"which they would stifle, move at such a pace!"

7864,107,"and all the stars, fast as the clouds were riven,"
7865,107,"should sally forth, to keep thee company,"
7866,107,"hurrying and sparkling through the clear blue heaven,"
7867,107,"but, cynthia! should to thee the palm be given,"
7868,107,"queen both for beauty and for majesty,"
7869,108,"with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh,"
7870,108,"like stars in heaven, and joyously it showed;"
7871,108,"some lying fast at anchor in the road,"
7872,108,"some veering up and down, one knew not why,"
7873,108,a goodly vessel did i then espy
7874,108,come like a giant from a haven broad;
7875,108,"and lustily along the bay she strode,"
7876,108,"her tackling rich, and of apparel high,"
7877,108,"the ship was nought to me, nor i to her,"
7878,108,yet i pursued her with a lover's look;
7879,108,"this ship to all the rest did i prefer,"
7880,108,"when will she turn, and whither? she will brook"
7881,108,"no tarrying; where she comes the winds must stir,"
7882,108,"on went she, and due north her journey took,"
7883,109,i heard a thousand blended notes
7884,109,"while in a grove i sat reclined,"
7885,109,in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
7886,109,"bring sad thoughts to the mind,"
7887,109,
7888,109,to her fair works did nature link
7889,109,the human soul that through me ran;
7890,109,and much it grieved my heart to think
7891,109,"what man has made of man,"
7892,109,
7893,109,"through primrose tufts, in that sweet bower,"
7894,109,the periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
7895,109,and 'tis my faith that every flower
7896,109,"enjoys the air it breathes,"
7897,109,
7898,109,"the birds around me hopped and played,"
7899,109,their thoughts i cannot measure -

7901,109,"it seemed a thrill of pleasure,"
7902,109,
7903,109,the budding twigs spread out their fan
7904,109,to catch the breezy air;
7905,109,"and i must think, do all i can,"
7906,109,"that there was pleasure there,"
7907,109,
7908,109,"if this belief from heaven be sent,"
7909,109,"if such be nature's holy plan,"

7916,110,   or groom! -- we must run glittering like a brook
7917,110,"   in the open sunshine, or we are unblest,"
7918,110,"   the wealthiest man among us is the best,"
7919,110,   no grandeur now in nature or in book
7920,110,"   delights us, rapine, avarice, expense,"
7921,110,"  this is idolatry; and these we adore,"
7922,110,"  plain living and high thinking are no more,"
7923,110,  the homely beauty of the good old cause

7951,112,"  once more, by newark's castle-gate"
7952,112,"    long left without a warder,"
7953,112,"  i stood, looked, listened, and with thee,"
7954,112,    great minstrel of the border!
7955,112,"  grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day,"
7956,112,   their dignity installing
7957,112," in gentle bosoms, while sere leaves"

7963,112,
7964,112, for busy thoughts the stream flowed on
7965,112,   in foamy agitation;
7966,112, and slept in many a crystal pool
7967,112,"   for quiet contemplation,"
7968,112, no public and no private care
7969,112,"   the freeborn mind enthralling,"
7970,112," we made a day of happy hours,"
7971,112,"   our happy days recalling,"
7972,112,
7973,112," brisk youth appeared, the morn of youth,"
7974,112,"   with freaks of graceful folly,-"

7981,112,
7982,112," and if, as yarrow, through the woods"
7983,112,"   and down the meadow ranging,"
7984,112," did meet us with unaltered face,"

7986,112," if, then, some natural shadows spread"
7987,112,"   our inward prospect over,"

8033,112," dreams treasured up from early days,"
8034,112,"   the holy and the tender,"

8045,112, nor deem that localized romance

8244,115,to scotland's heaths; or those that crossed the sea
8245,115,"and drew their sounding bows at azincour,"
8246,115,"perhaps at earlier crecy, or poictiers,"
8247,115,of vast circumference and gloom profound
8248,115,this solitary tree! -a living thing
8249,115,produced too slowly ever to decay;
8250,115,of form and aspect too magnificent
8251,115,"to be destroyed, but worthier still of note"
8252,115,"are those fraternal four of borrowdale,"
8253,115,joined in one solemn and capacious grove;
8254,115,huge trunks! -and each particular trunk a growth
8255,115,of intertwisted fibres serpentine
8256,115,"up-coiling, and inveteratley convolved, -"
8257,115,"nor uninformed with fantasy, and looks"
8258,115,"that threaten the profane; -a pillared shade,"
8259,115,"upon whose grassless floor of red-brown hue,"
8260,115,by sheddings from the pining umbrage tinged
8261,115,perennially -beneath whose sable roof
8262,115,"of boughs, as if for festal purpose decked"
8263,115,with unrejoicing berries -ghostly shapes
8264,115,"may meet at noontide, fear and trembling hope,"
8265,115,"silence and foresight, death the skeleton"
8266,115,"and time the shadow; there to celebrate,"
8267,115,as in a natural temple scattered o'er
8268,115,"with altars undisturbed of mossy stone,"
8269,115,united worship; or in mute repose
8270,115,"to lie, and listen to the mountain flood"
8271,115,"murmuring from glaramara's inmost caves,"
