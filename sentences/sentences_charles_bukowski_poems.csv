200,5,"from his rolled cigarettes dropped onto his undershirt, some of the ash was still burning,"
201,5,"sometimes the burning ash missed the undershirt and hit his skin, then he cursed, brushing"
202,5,"it away, there was a knock on the trailer door, he got slowly to his feet and answered the"
203,5,"door, it was constance, she had a fifth of unopened whiskey in a bag,"
204,5,"george, i left that son of a bitch, i couldn't stand that son of a bitch"
205,5,"anymore,"
206,5,"sit down,"
207,5,"george opened the fifth, got two glasses, filled each a third with whiskey, two thirds"
208,5,"with water, he sat down on the bed with constance, she took a cigarette out of her purse"
209,5,"and lit it, she was drunk and her hands trembled,"
210,5,"i took his damn money too, i took his damn money and split while he was at work,"
211,5,"you don't know how i've suffered with that son of a bitch, "
212,5,"lemme have a smoke, said george, she handed it to him and as she leaned near,"
213,5,"george put his arm around her, pulled her over and kissed her,"
214,5,"you son of a bitch, she said, i missed you,"
215,5,"i miss those good legs of yours , connie, i've really missed those good"
216,5,"legs,"

218,5,"i get hot just looking,"
219,5,"i could never make it with a college guy, said connie, they're too"
220,5,"soft, they're milk toast, and he kept his house clean, george , it was like having a maid,"
221,5,"he did it all, the place was spotless, you could eat beef stew right off the crapper, he"
222,5,"was antiseptic, that's what he was,"
223,5,"drink up, you'll feel better,"
224,5,"and he couldn't make love,"
225,5,you mean he couldn't get it up?
226,5,"oh he got it up, he got it up all the time, but he didn't know how to make a"
227,5,"woman happy, you know, he didn't know what to do, all that money, all that education, he"
228,5,"was useless,"
229,5,"i wish i had a college education,"
230,5,"you don't need one, you have everything you need, george,"

234,5,yeh?
235,5,"yes, and you know what else? his mother came around! his mother! two or three"
236,5,"times a week, and she'd sit there looking at me, pretending to like me but all the time"
237,5,"she was treating me like i was a whore, like i was a big bad whore stealing her son away"
238,5,"from her! her precious wallace! christ! what a mess! he claimed he loved me,"
239,5,"and i'd say, 'look at my pussy, walter!' and he wouldn't look at my pussy, he said, 'i"
240,5,"don't want to look at that thing,' that thing! that's what he called it! you're not afraid"
241,5,"of my pussy, are you, george?"
242,5,"it's never bit me yet, but you've bit it, you've nibbled it, haven't"
243,5,you george?
244,5,"i suppose i have,"
245,5,"and you've licked it , sucked it?"
246,5,"i suppose so,"
247,5,"you know damn well, george, what you've done,"
248,5,how much money did you get?
249,5,"six hundred dollars,"
250,5,"i don't like people who rob other people, connie,"
251,5,"that's why you're a fucking dishwasher, you're honest, but he's such an ass,"
252,5,"george, and he can afford the money, and i've earned it, him and his mother and his"
253,5,"love, his mother-love, his clean l;little wash bowls and toilets and disposal bags and"
254,5,breath chasers and after shave lotions and his little hard-ons and his precious
255,5,"lovemaking, all for himself, you understand, all for himself! you know what a woman"
256,5,"wants, george,"
257,5,"thanks for the whiskey, connie, lemme have another cigarette,"
258,5,"george filled them up again, i missed your legs, connie, i've really missed those"
259,5,"legs, i like the way you wear those high heels, they drive me crazy, these modern women"
260,5,"don't know what they're missing, the high heel shapes the calf, the thigh, the ass; it"
261,5,"puts rhythm into the walk, it really turns me on!"
262,5,"you talk like a poet, george, sometimes you talk like that, you are one hell of a"
263,5,"dishwasher,"
264,5,you know what i'd really like to do?
265,5,what?
266,5,"i'd like to whip you with my belt on the legs, the ass, the thighs, i'd like to"
267,5,make you quiver and cry and then when you're quivering and crying i'd slam it into you
268,5,"pure love,"
269,5,"i don't want that, george, you've never talked like that to me before, you've"
270,5,"always done right with me,"
271,5,"pull your dress up higher,"
272,5,what?
273,5,"pull your dress up higher, i want to see more of your legs,"
274,5,"you like my legs, don't you, george?"
275,5,let the light shine on them!
276,5,"constance hiked her dress,"
277,5,"god christ shit, said george,"
278,5,you like my legs?
279,5,i love your legs! then george reached across the bed and slapped constance
280,5,"hard across the face, her cigarette flipped out of her mouth,"
281,5,what'd you do that for?
282,5,you fucked walter! you fucked walter!
283,5,so what the hell?
284,5,so pull your dress up higher!
285,5,no!
286,5,"do what i say! george slapped again, harder, constance hiked her skirt,"
287,5,"just up to the panties! shouted george, i don't quite want to see the"
288,5,panties!
289,5,"christ, george, what's gone wrong with you?"
290,5,you fucked walter!
291,5,"george, i swear, you've gone crazy, i want to leave, let me out of here,"
292,5,george!
293,5,don't move or i'll kill you!
294,5,you'd kill me?
295,5,"i swear it! george got up and poured himself a shot of straight whiskey,"
296,5,"drank it, and sat down next to constance, he took the cigarette and held it against her"
297,5,"wrist, she screamed, he held it there, firmly, then pulled it away,"
298,5,"i'm a man , baby, understand that?"
299,5,"i know you're a man , george,"
300,5,"here, look at my muscles! george sat up and flexed both of his arms,"
301,5,"beautiful, eh ,baby? look at that muscle! feel it! feel it!"
302,5,"constance felt one of the arms, then the other,"
303,5,"yes, you have a beautiful body, george,"
304,5,"i'm a man, i'm a dishwasher but i'm a man, a real man,"
305,5,"i know it, george, i'm not the milk shit you left,"
306,5,"i know it,"
307,5,"and i can sing, too, you ought to hear my voice,"
308,5,"constance sat there, george began to sing, he sang old man river, then he"
309,5,"sang nobody knows the trouble i've seen, he sang the st, louis"
310,5,"blues, he sang god bless america, stopping several times and laughing,"
311,5,"then he sat down next to constance, he said, connie, you have beautiful legs,"
312,5,"he asked for another cigarette, he smoked it, drank two more drinks, then put his head"
313,5,"down on connie's legs, against the stockings, in her lap, and he said, connie, i"
314,5,"guess i'm no good, i guess i'm crazy, i'm sorry i hit you, i'm sorry i burned you with"
315,5,"that cigarette,"
316,5,"constance sat there, she ran her fingers through george's hair, stroking him, soothing"
317,5,"him, soon he was asleep, she waited a while longer, then she lifted his head and placed it"
318,5,"on the pillow, lifted his legs and straightened them out on the bed, she stood up, walked"
319,5,"to the fifth, poured a jolt of good whiskey in to her glass, added a touch of water and"
320,5,"drank it sown, she walked to the trailer door, pulled it open, stepped out, closed it, she"
321,5,"walked through the backyard, opened the fence gate, walked up the alley under the one"
322,5,"o'clock moon, the sky was clear of clouds, the same sky full of clouds was up there, she got"
323,5,"out on the boulevard and walked east and reached the entrance of the blue mirror, she"
324,5,"walked in, and there was walter sitting alone and drunk at the end of the bar, she walked"
325,5,"up and sat down next to him, missed me, baby? she asked, walter looked up, he"
326,5,"recognized her, he didn't answer, he looked at the bartender and the bartender walked"
327,5,"toward them they all knew each other,"
328,6,it was on the 2nd floor on coronado street
329,6,i used to get drunk
330,6,and throw the radio through the window
331,6,"while it was playing, and, of course,"
332,6,it would break the glass in the window
333,6,and the radio would sit there on the roof
334,6,still playing
335,6,"and i'd tell my woman,"
336,6,"ah, what a marvelous radio!"
337,6,the next morning i'd take the window
338,6,off the hinges
339,6,and carry it down the street
340,6,to the glass man
341,6,"who would put in another pane,"
342,6,i kept throwing that radio through the window
343,6,each time i got drunk
344,6,and it would sit there on the roof
345,6,still playing-
346,6,a magic radio
347,6,"a radio with guts,"
348,6,and each morning i'd take the window
349,6,"back to the glass man,"
350,6,i don't remember how it ended exactly
351,6,though i do remember
352,6,"we finally moved out,"
353,6,there was a woman downstairs who worked in
354,6,"the garden in her bathing suit,"
355,6,she really dug with that trowel
356,6,and she put her behind up in the air
357,6,and i used to sit in the window
358,6,and watch the sun shine all over that thing
359,6,"while the music played,"
360,7,we had goldfish and they circled around and around
361,7,in the bowl on the table near the heavy drapes
362,7,covering the picture window and
363,7,"my mother, always smiling, wanting us all"
364,7,"to be happy, told me, be happy henry!"
365,7,"and she was right, it's better to be happy if you"
366,7,can
367,7,but my father continued to beat her and me several times a week while
368,7,raging inside his 6-foot-two frame because he couldn't
369,7,"understand what was attacking him from within,"
370,7,
371,7,"my mother, poor fish,"
372,7,"wanting to be happy, beaten two or three times a"
373,7,"week, telling me to be happy, henry, smile!"
374,7,why don't you ever smile?
375,7,
376,7,"and then she would smile, to show me how, and it was the"
377,7,saddest smile i ever saw
378,7,
379,7,"one day the goldfish died, all five of them,"
380,7,"they floated on the water, on their sides, their"
381,7,"eyes still open,"
382,7,and when my father got home he threw them to the cat
383,7,there on the kitchen floor and we watched as my mother
384,7,smiled
385,8,the flesh covers the bone
386,8,and they put a mind
387,8,in there and
388,8,"sometimes a soul,"
389,8,and the women break
390,8,vases against the walls
391,8,and the men drink too
392,8,much
393,8,and nobody finds the
394,8,one
395,8,but keep
396,8,looking
397,8,crawling in and out
398,8,"of beds,"
399,8,flesh covers

422,9,i see you drinking at a fountain with tiny
423,9,"blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny"
424,9,"they are small, and the fountain is in france"
425,9,where you wrote me that last letter and
426,9,"i answered and never heard from you again,"
427,9,you used to write insane poems about
428,9,"angels and god, all in upper case, and you"
429,9,knew famous artists and most of them
430,9,"were your lovers, and i wrote back, it’ all right,"
431,9,"go ahead, enter their lives, i’ not jealous"
432,9,"because we’ never met, we got close once in"
433,9,"new orleans, one half block, but never met, never"
434,9,"touched, so you went with the famous and wrote"
435,9,"about the famous, and, of course, what you found out"
436,9,is that the famous are worried about
437,9,their fame –– not the beautiful young girl in bed
438,9,"with them, who gives them that, and then awakens"
439,9,in the morning to write upper case poems about
440,9,"angels and god, we know god is dead, they’ told"
441,9,"us, but listening to you i wasn’ sure, maybe"
442,9,"it was the upper case, you were one of the"
443,9,"best female poets and i told the publishers,"
444,9,"editors, “ her, print her, she’ mad but she’"
445,9,"magic, there’ no lie in her fire,” i loved you"
446,9,"like a man loves a woman he never touches, only"
447,9,"writes to, keeps little photographs of, i would have"
448,9,loved you more if i had sat in a small room rolling a
449,9,"cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,"
450,9,"but that didn’ happen, your letters got sadder,"
451,9,"your lovers betrayed you, kid, i wrote back, all"
452,9,"lovers betray, it didn’ help, you said"
453,9,you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and
454,9,the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying
455,9,bench every night and wept for the lovers who had
456,9,"hurt and forgotten you, i wrote back but never"
457,9,"heard again, a friend wrote me of your suicide"
458,9,"3 or 4 months after it happened, if i had met you"
459,9,i would probably have been unfair to you or you
460,9,"to me, it was best like this,"

462,10,"that's what good for the soul,"
463,10,peeking into windows
464,10,watching tired housewives
465,10,trying to fight off
466,10,"their beer-maddened husbands,"
467,11,having the low down blues and going
468,11,"into a restaurant to eat,"
469,11,"you sit at a table,"
470,11,"the waitress smiles at you,"
471,11,"she's dumpy, her ass is too big,"
472,11,"she radiates kindness and sympathy,"
473,11,"live with her 3 months and a man would no real agony,"
474,11,"o,k,, you'll tip her 15 percent,"
475,11,you order a turkey sandwich and a
476,11,"beer,"
477,11,the man at the table across from you
478,11,has watery blue eyes and
479,11,"a head like an elephant,"
480,11,at a table further down are 3 men
481,11,with very tiny heads
482,11,and long necks
483,11,"like ostriches,"
484,11,"they talk loudly of land development,"
485,11,"why, you think, did i ever come"
486,11,in here when i have the low-down
487,11,blues?
488,11,then the the waitress comes back with the sandwich
489,11,and she asks you if there will be anything
490,11,else?
491,11,"and you tell her, no no, this will be"
492,11,"fine,"
493,11,"then somebody behind you laughs,"
494,11,it's a cork laugh filled with sand and
495,11,"broken glass,"
496,11,
497,11,"you begin eating the sandwich,"
498,11,
499,11,"it's something,"
500,11,"it's a minor, difficult,"
501,11,sensible action
502,11,like composing a popular song
503,11,to make a 14-year old
504,11,"weep,"
505,11,"you order another beer,"
506,11,"jesus, look at that guy"
507,11,his hands hang down almost to his knees and he's
508,11,"whistling,"
509,11,"well, time to get out,"
510,11,"pick up the bill,"
511,11,"tip,"
512,11,"go to the register,"
513,11,"pay,"
514,11,"pick up a toothpick,"
515,11,"go out the door,"
516,11,"your car is still there,"
517,11,and there are 3 men with heads
518,11,and necks
519,11,like ostriches all getting into one
520,11,"car,"
521,11,they each have a toothpick and now
522,11,"they are talking about women,"
523,11,they drive away first
524,11,"they drive away fast,"
525,11,"they're best i guess,"
526,11,"it's an unbearably hot day,"
527,11,"there's a first-stage smog alert,"
528,11,all the birds and plants are dead
529,11,"or dying,"
530,11,
531,11,"you start the engine,"
532,12,"washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook"
533,12, out again
534,12, i write from the bed
535,12, as i did last
536,12," year,"
537,12," will see the doctor,"
538,12," monday,"
539,12," yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head-"
540,12, aches and my back
541,12," hurts,"
542,12," are you drinking? he will ask,"
543,12, are you getting your
544,12,"exercise, your"
545,12, vitamins?
546,12, i think that i am just ill
547,12," with life, the same stale yet"
548,12, fluctuating
549,12," factors,"
550,12, even at the track
551,12, i watch the horses run by
552,12, and it seems
553,12," meaningless,"
554,12, i leave early after buying tickets on the
555,12," remaining races,"
556,12, taking off? asks the motel
557,12," clerk,"
558,12," yes, it's boring,"
559,12," i tell him,"
560,12, if you think it's boring
561,12," out there, he tells me, you oughta be"
562,12," back here,"
563,12, so here i am
564,12, propped up against my pillows
565,12, again
566,12, just an old guy
567,12, just an old writer
568,12, with a yellow
569,12," notebook,"
570,12, something is
571,12, walking across the
572,12, floor
573,12, toward
574,12," me,"
575,12," oh, it's just"
576,12, my cat
577,12, this
578,12," time,"
579,13,as the poems go into the thousands you
580,13,realize that you've created very
581,13,"little,"
582,13,"it comes down to the rain, the sunlight,"
583,13,"the traffic, the nights and the days of the"
584,13,"years, the faces,"
585,13,leaving this will be easier than living
586,13,"it, typing one more line now as"
587,13,"a man plays a piano through the radio,"
588,13,the best writers have said very
589,13,little
590,13,"and the worst,"
591,13,"far too much,"
592,13,from onthebus - 1992
593,14,"to give life you must take life,"
594,14,and as our grief falls flat and hollow
595,14,upon the billion-blooded sea
596,14,i pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed
597,14,"with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures"
598,14,"lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes,"
599,14,"dear child, i only did to you what the sparrow"
600,14,did to you; i am old when it is fashionable to be
601,14,"young; i cry when it is fashionable to laugh,"
602,14,i hated you when it would have taken less courage
603,14,"to love,"
604,15,i awaken about noon and go out to get the mail
605,15,"in my old torn bathrobe,"
606,15,i'm hung over
607,15,hair down in my eyes
608,15,barefoot
609,15,gingerly walking on the small sharp rocks
610,15,in my path
611,15,"still afraid of pain behind my four-day beard,"
612,15,
613,15,the young housewife next door shakes a rug
614,15,"out of her window and sees me,"
615,15,"hello, hank!"
616,15,
617,15,god damn! it's almost like being shot in the ass
618,15,"with a ,22"
619,15,
620,15,"hello, i say"
621,15,"gathering up my visa card bill, my penny saver coupons,"
622,15,"a dept, of water and power past-due notice,"
623,15,a letter from the mortgage people
624,15,plus a demand from the weed abatement department
625,15,"giving me 30 days to clean up my act,"
626,15,
627,15,i mince back again over the small sharp rocks
628,15,"thinking, maybe i'd better write something tonight,"
629,15,they all seem
630,15,"to be closing in,"
631,15,
632,15,"there's only one way to handle those motherfuckers,"
633,15,
634,15,"the night harness races will have to wait,"
635,16,we are always asked
636,16,to understand the other person's
637,16,viewpoint
638,16,no matter how
639,16,outdated
640,16,foolish or
641,16,"obnoxious,"
642,16,one is asked
643,16,to view
644,16,their total error
645,16,their life-waste
646,16,with
647,16,"kindliness,"
648,16,especially if they are
649,16,"aged,"
650,16,but age is the total of
651,16,"our doing,"
652,16,they have aged
653,16,badly
654,16,because they have
655,16,lived
656,16,"out of focus,"
657,16,they have refused to
658,16,"see,"
659,16,not their fault?
660,16,whose fault?
661,16,mine?
662,16,i am asked to hide
663,16,my viewpoint
664,16,from them
665,16,for fear of their
666,16,"fear,"
667,16,age is no crime
668,16,but the shame
669,16,of a deliberately
670,16,wasted
671,16,life
672,16,among so many
673,16,deliberately
674,16,wasted
675,16,lives
676,16,"is,"
677,17,"drunk on the dark streets of some city,"
678,17,"it's night, you're lost, where's your"
679,17,room?
680,17,"you enter a bar to find yourself,"
681,17,"order scotch and water,"
682,17,"damned bar's sloppy wet, it soaks"
683,17,part of one of your shirt
684,17,"sleeves,"
685,17,"it's a clip joint-the scotch is weak,"
686,17,"you order a bottle of beer,"
687,17,madame death walks up to you
688,17,"wearing a dress,"
689,17,"she sits down, you buy her a"
690,17,"beer, she stinks of swamps, presses"
691,17,"a leg against you,"
692,17,"the bar tender sneers,"
693,17,"you've got him worried, he doesn't"
694,17,"know if you're a cop, a killer, a"
695,17,madman or an
696,17,"idiot,"
697,17,"you ask for a vodka,"
698,17,you pour the vodka into the top of
699,17,"the beer bottle,"
700,17,"it's one a,m, in a dead cow world,"
701,17,"you ask her how much for head,"
702,17,"drink everything down, it tastes"
703,17,"like machine oil,"
704,17,
705,17,"you leave madame death there,"
706,17,you leave the sneering bartender
707,17,"there,"
708,17,
709,17,you have remembered where
710,17,"your room is,"
711,17,the room with the full bottle of
712,17,"wine on the dresser,"
713,17,the room with the dance of the
714,17,"roaches,"
715,17,perfection in the star turd
716,17,where love died
717,17,"laughing,"
718,18,there's a bluebird in my heart that
719,18,wants to get out
720,18,"but i'm too tough for him,"
721,18,"i say, stay in there, i'm not going"
722,18,to let anybody see
723,18,"you,"
724,18,there's a bluebird in my heart that
725,18,wants to get out
726,18,but i pour whiskey on him and inhale
727,18,cigarette smoke
728,18,and the whores and the bartenders
729,18,and the grocery clerks
730,18,never know that
731,18,he's
732,18,"in there,"
733,18,
734,18,there's a bluebird in my heart that
735,18,wants to get out
736,18,"but i'm too tough for him,"
737,18,"i say,"
738,18,"stay down, do you want to mess"
739,18,me up?
740,18,you want to screw up the
741,18,works?
742,18,you want to blow my book sales in
743,18,europe?
744,18,there's a bluebird in my heart that
745,18,wants to get out
746,18,"but i'm too clever, i only let him out"
747,18,at night sometimes
748,18,"when everybody's asleep,"
749,18,"i say, i know that you're there,"
750,18,so don't be
751,18,"sad,"
752,18,"then i put him back,"
753,18,but he's singing a little
754,18,"in there, i haven't quite let him"
755,18,die
756,18,and we sleep together like
757,18,that
758,18,with our
759,18,secret pact
760,18,and it's nice enough to
761,18,make a man
762,18,"weep, but i don't"
763,18,"weep, do"
764,18,you?
765,19,she died of alcoholism
766,19,wrapped in a blanket
767,19,on a deck chair
768,19,on an ocean
769,19,"steamer,"
770,19,
771,19,all her books of
772,19,terrified loneliness
773,19,
774,19,all her books about
775,19,the cruelty
776,19,of loveless love
777,19,
778,19,were all that was left
779,19,of her
780,19,
781,19,as the strolling vacationer
782,19,discovered her body
783,19,
784,19,notified the captain
785,19,
786,19,and she was quickly dispatched
787,19,to somewhere else
788,19,on the ship
789,19,
790,19,as everything
791,19,continued just
792,19,as
793,19,she had written it
794,20,the best often die by their own hand
795,20,"just to get away,"
796,20,and those left behind
797,20,can never quite understand
798,20,why anybody
799,20,would ever want to
800,20,get away
801,20,from
802,20,them
803,21,at one stage in my life
804,21,i met a man who claimed to have
805,21,"visited pound at st, elizabeth's,"
806,21,
807,21,then i met a woman who not only
808,21,claimed to have visited
809,21,"e,p,"
810,21,but also to have made love
811,21,to him—she even showed
812,21,me
813,21,certain sections in the
814,21,cantos
815,21,where ezra was supposed to have
816,21,mentioned
817,21,"her,"
818,21,
819,21,so there was this man and
820,21,this woman
821,21,and the woman told me
822,21,that pound had never
823,21,mentioned a visit from this
824,21,man
825,21,and the man claimed that the
826,21,lady had had nothing to do
827,21,with the
828,21,master
829,21,that she was a
830,21,charlatan
831,21,
832,21,and since i wasn't a
833,21,poundian scholar
834,21,i didn't know who to
835,21,believe
836,21,but one thing i do
837,21,"know, when a man is"
838,21,living
839,21,many claim relationships
840,21,that are hardly
841,21,so
842,21,"and after he dies, well,"
843,21,then it's everybody's
844,21,"party,"
845,21,
846,21,my guess is that pound
847,21,knew neither the lady or the
848,21,gentleman
849,21,
850,21,or if he knew
851,21,one
852,21,or if he knew
853,21,both
854,21,
855,21,it was a shameful waste of
856,21,madhouse
857,21,"time,"
858,22,waiting for death
859,22,like a cat
860,22,that will jump on the
861,22,bed
862,22,
863,22,i am so very sorry for
864,22,my wife
865,22,
866,22,she will see this
867,22,stiff
868,22,white
869,22,body
870,22,"shake it once, then"
871,22,maybe
872,22,again
873,22,
874,22,hank!
875,22,
876,22,hank won't
877,22,"answer,"
878,22,
879,22,it's not my death that
880,22,"worries me, it's my wife"
881,22,left with this
882,22,pile of
883,22,"nothing,"
884,22,
885,22,i want to
886,22,let her know
887,22,though
888,22,that all the nights
889,22,sleeping
890,22,beside her
891,22,
892,22,even the useless
893,22,arguments
894,22,were things
895,22,ever splendid
896,22,
897,22,and the hard
898,22,words
899,22,i ever feared to
900,22,say
901,22,can now be
902,22,"said,"
903,22,
904,22,i love
905,22,"you,"
906,23,i even hear the mountains
907,23,the way they laugh
908,23,up and down their blue sides
909,23,and down in the water
910,23,the fish cry
911,23,and the water
912,23,"is their tears,"
913,23,i listen to the water
914,23,on nights i drink away
915,23,and the sadness becomes so great
916,23,i hear it in my clock
917,23,it becomes knobs upon my dresser
918,23,it becomes paper on the floor
919,23,it becomes a shoehorn
920,23,a laundry ticket
921,23,it becomes
922,23,cigarette smoke
923,23,"climbing a chapel of dark vines, , ,"
924,23,it matters little
925,23,very little love is not so bad
926,23,or very little life
927,23,what counts
928,23,is waiting on walls
929,23,i was born for this
930,23,"i was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead,"
931,24,good weather
932,24,is like
933,24,good women-
934,24,it doesn't always happen
935,24,and when it does
936,24,it doesn't
937,24,"always last,"
938,24,man is
939,24,"more stable,"
940,24,if he's bad
941,24,there's more chance
942,24,"he'll stay that way,"
943,24,or if he's good
944,24,he might hang
945,24,"on,"
946,24,but a woman
947,24,is changed
948,24,by
949,24,children
950,24,age
951,24,diet
952,24,conversation
953,24,sex
954,24,the moon
955,24,the absence or
956,24,presence of sun
957,24,"or good times,"
958,24,a woman must be nursed
959,24,into subsistence
960,24,by love
961,24,where a man can become
962,24,stronger
963,24,"by being hated,"
964,24,i am drinking tonight in spangler's bar
965,24,and i remember the cows
966,24,i once painted in art class
967,24,and they looked good
968,24,they looked better than anything
969,24,"in here, i am drinking in spangler's bar"
970,24,wondering which to love and which
971,24,"to hate, but the rules are gone,"
972,24,i love and hate only
973,24,myself-
974,24,they stand outside me
975,24,like an orange dropped from the table
976,24,and rolling away; it's what i've got to
977,24,"decide,"
978,24,kill myself or
979,24,love myself?
980,24,which is the treason?
981,24,where's the information
982,24,coming from?
983,24,"books,like broken glass,"
984,24,i wouldn't wipe my ass with 'em
985,24,"yet, it's getting"
986,24,"darker, see?"
987,24,we drink here and speak to
988,24,each other and

995,24,the bartender slides me a beer

997,24,like an olympic sprinter
998,24,and the pair of pliers that is my hand
999,24,"stops it, lifts it,"
1000,24,"golden piss of dull temptation,"
1001,24,i drink and
1002,24,stand there
1003,24,the weather bad for cows
1004,24,but my brush is ready
1005,24,to stroke up
1006,24,the green grass straw eye
1007,24,sadness takes me all over
1008,24,and i drink the beer straight down

1010,24,fast
1011,24,to give me the guts and the love to
1012,24,go
1013,24,"on,"
1014,25,the final curtain on one of the longest running
1015,25,"musicals ever, some people claim to have"
1016,25,"seen it over one hundred times,"
1017,25,"i saw it on the tv news, that final curtain,"
1018,25,"flowers, cheers, tears, a thunderous"
1019,25,"accolade,"
1020,25,i have not seen this particular musical
1021,25,but i know if i had that i wouldn't have
1022,25,"been able to bear it, it would have"
1023,25,"sickened me,"
1024,25,"trust me on this, the world and its"
1025,25,peoples and its artful entertainment has
1026,25,"done very little for me, only to me,"
1027,25,"still, let them enjoy one another, it will"
1028,25,keep them from my door
1029,25,"and for this, my own thunderous"
1030,25,"accolade,"
1031,25,from the olympia review - 1994
1032,26,"it's never quite right, he said, the way people look,"
1033,26,"the way the music sounds, the way the words are"
1034,26,"written,"
1035,26,"it's never quite right, he said, all the things we are"
1036,26,"taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we"
1037,26,"die, all the lives we live,"
1038,26,"they are never quite right,"
1039,26,"they are hardly close to right,"
1040,26,these lives we live
1041,26,"one after the other,"
1042,26,"piled there as history,"
1043,26,"the waste of the species,"
1044,26,"the crushing of the light and the way,"
1045,26,"it's not quite right,"
1046,26,it's hardly right at all
1047,26,"he said,"
1048,26,
1049,26,don't i know it? i
1050,26,"answered,"
1051,26,
1052,26,"i walked away from the mirror,"
1053,26,"it was morning, it was afternoon, it was"
1054,26,night
1055,26,
1056,26,nothing changed
1057,26,"it was locked in place,"
1058,26,"something flashed, something broke, something"
1059,26,"remained,"
1060,26,
1061,26,i walked down the stairway and
1062,26,"into it,"
1063,27,"death wants more death, and its webs are full,"
1064,27,"i remember my father's garage, how child-like"
1065,27,i would brush the corpses of flies
1066,27,from the windows they thought were escape-
1067,27,"their sticky, ugly, vibrant bodies"
1068,27,shouting like dumb crazy dogs against the glass
1069,27,only to spin and flit
1070,27,in that second larger than hell or heaven
1071,27,"onto the edge of the ledge,"
1072,27,and then the spider from his dank hole
1073,27,nervous and exposed
1074,27,the puff of body swelling
1075,27,hanging there
1076,27,"not really quite knowing,"
1077,27,and then knowing-
1078,27,"something sending it down its string,"
1079,27,"the wet web,"
1080,27,"toward the weak shield of buzzing,"
1081,27,the pulsing;
1082,27,a last desperate moving hair-leg
1083,27,there against the glass
1084,27,"there alive in the sun,"
1085,27,spun in white;
1086,27,"and almost like love,"
1087,27,"the closing over,"
1088,27,"the first hushed spider-sucking,"
1089,27,filling its sack
1090,27,upon this thing that lived;
1091,27,crouching there upon its back
1092,27,drawing its certain blood
1093,27,as the world goes by outside
1094,27,and my temples scream
1095,27,"and i hurl the broom against them,"
1096,27,the spider dull with spider-anger
1097,27,still thinking of its prey
1098,27,and waving an amazed broken leg;
1099,27,"the fly very still,"
1100,27,a dirty speck stranded to straw;
1101,27,i shake the killer loose
1102,27,and he walks lame and peeved
1103,27,towards some dark corner
1104,27,but i intercept his dawdling
1105,27,"his crawling like some broken hero,"
1106,27,and the straws smash his legs
1107,27,now waving
1108,27,above his head
1109,27,and looking
1110,27,looking for the enemy
1111,27,"and somewhat valiant,"
1112,27,dying without apparent pain
1113,27,simply crawling backward
1114,27,piece by piece
1115,27,leaving nothing there
1116,27,until at last the red gut sack
1117,27,splashes
1118,27,"its secrets,"
1119,27,and i run child-like
1120,27,"with god's anger a step behind,"
1121,27,"back to simple sunlight,"
1122,27,wondering
1123,27,as the world goes by
1124,27,with curled smile
1125,27,if anyone else
1126,27,saw or sensed my crime
1127,28,"naked along the side of the house,"
1128,28,"8 a,m,, spreading sesame seed oil"
1129,28,"over my body, jesus, have i come"
1130,28,to this?
1131,28,i once battled in dark alleys for a
1132,28,"laugh,"
1133,28,"now i'm not laughing,"
1134,28,"i splash myself with oil and wonder,"
1135,28,how many years do you want?
1136,28,how many days?
1137,28,my blood is soiled and a dark
1138,28,"angel sits in my brain,"
1139,28,things are made of something and
1140,28,"go to nothing,"
1141,28,"i understand the fall of cities, of"
1142,28,"nations,"
1143,28,"a small plane passes overhead,"
1144,28,i look upward as if it made sense to
1145,28,"look upward,"
1146,28,"it's true, the sky has rotted,"
1147,28,it won't be long for any of
1148,28,"us,"
1149,28,from the olympia review - 1994
1150,29,"i've come by, she says, to tell you"
1151,29,"that this is it, i'm not kidding, it's"
1152,29,"over, this is it,"
1153,29,i sit on the couch watching her arrange
1154,29,her long red hair before my bedroom
1155,29,"mirror,"
1156,29,she pulls her hair up and
1157,29,piles it on top of her head-
1158,29,she lets her eyes look at
1159,29,my eyes-
1160,29,then she drops her hair and
1161,29,"lets it fall down in front of her face,"
1162,29,we go to bed and i hold her
1163,29,speechlessly from the back
1164,29,my arm around her neck
1165,29,i touch her wrists and hands
1166,29,feel up to
1167,29,her elbows
1168,29,"no further,"
1169,29,"she gets up,"
1170,29,"this is it, she says,"
1171,29,"this will do, well,"
1172,29,"i'm going,"
1173,29,i get up and walk her
1174,29,to the door
1175,29,just as she leaves
1176,29,"she says,"
1177,29,i want you to buy me
1178,29,some high-heeled shoes
1179,29,"with tall thin spikes,"
1180,29,"black high-heeled shoes,"
1181,29,"no, i want them"
1182,29,"red,"
1183,29,i watch her walk down the cement walk
1184,29,under the trees
1185,29,she walks all right and
1186,29,as the poinsettias drip in the sun
1187,29,"i close the door,"
1188,30,some dogs who sleep at night
1189,30,must dream of bones
1190,30,and i remember your bones
1191,30,in flesh
1192,30,and best
1193,30,in that dark green dress
1194,30,and those high-heeled bright
1195,30,"black shoes,"
1196,30,"you always cursed when you drank,"
1197,30,your hair coming down you
1198,30,wanted to explode out of
1199,30,"what was holding you,"
1200,30,rotten memories of a
1201,30,rotten
1202,30,"past, and"
1203,30,you finally got
1204,30,out
1205,30,"by dying,"
1206,30,leaving me with the
1207,30,rotten
1208,30,present;
1209,30,you've been dead
1210,30,28 years
1211,30,yet i remember you
1212,30,better than any of
1213,30,the rest;
1214,30,you were the only one
1215,30,who understood
1216,30,the futility of the
1217,30,arrangement of
1218,30,life;
1219,30,all the others were only
1220,30,displeased with
1221,30,"trivial segments,"
1222,30,carped
1223,30,nonsensically about
1224,30,nonsense;
1225,30,"jane, you were"

1227,30,"knowing too much,"

1234,31,we are like roses that have never bothered to
1235,31,bloom when we should have bloomed and
1236,31,it is as if
1237,31,the sun has become disgusted with
1238,31,waiting
1239,32,the critics now have me
1240,32,drinking champagne and
1241,32,driving a bmw
1242,32,and also married to a
1243,32,socialite from
1244,32,philadelphia's main line
1245,32,which of course is going to prevent me
1246,32,from writing my earthy
1247,32,"and grubby stuff,"
1248,32,and they might be
1249,32,"right,"
1250,32,i could be getting to be
1251,32,"more like them,"
1252,32,and that's as close to
1253,32,death as you can
1254,32,"get,"
1255,32,
1256,32,"we'll see,"
1257,32,"but don't bury me yet,"
1258,32,don't worry if i drink with

1260,32,just measure the poems
1261,32,as they come off the
1262,32,"keyboard,"
1263,32,"listen only to them,"
1264,32,after this long fight
1265,32,i have no intention of
1266,32,"quitting short,"
1267,32,"or late,"
1268,32,"or satisfied,"
1269,33,you haven't lived
1270,33,until you've been in a
1271,33,flophouse
1272,33,with nothing but one
1273,33,light bulb
1274,33,and 56 men
1275,33,squeezed together
1276,33,on cots
1277,33,with everybody
1278,33,snoring
1279,33,at once
1280,33,and some of those
1281,33,snores
1282,33,so
1283,33,deep and
1284,33,gross and
1285,33,unbelievable-
1286,33,dark
1287,33,snotty
1288,33,gross
1289,33,subhuman
1290,33,wheezings
1291,33,from hell
1292,33,"itself,"
1293,33,your mind
1294,33,almost breaks
1295,33,under those
1296,33,death-like
1297,33,sounds
1298,33,and the
1299,33,intermingling
1300,33,"odors,"
1301,33,hard
1302,33,unwashed socks
1303,33,pissed and
1304,33,shitted

1306,33,and over it all
1307,33,slowly circulating
1308,33,air
1309,33,much like that
1310,33,emanating from
1311,33,uncovered
1312,33,garbage
1313,33,"cans,"
1314,33,and those
1315,33,bodies
1316,33,in the dark
1317,33,fat and
1318,33,thin
1319,33,and

1323,33,armless
1324,33,some
1325,33,mindless
1326,33,and worst of
1327,33,"all,"
1328,33,the total
1329,33,absence of
1330,33,hope
1331,33,it shrouds
1332,33,them
1333,33,covers them
1334,33,"totally,"
1335,33,it's not
1336,33,"bearable,"
1337,33,you get
1338,33,up
1339,33,go out
1340,33,walk the
1341,33,streets
1342,33,up and
1343,33,down
1344,33,sidewalks
1345,33,past buildings
1346,33,around the
1347,33,corner
1348,33,and back
1349,33,up
1350,33,the same
1351,33,street
1352,33,thinking
1353,33,those men
1354,33,were all
1355,33,children
1356,33,once
1357,33,what has happened
1358,33,to
1359,33,them?
1360,33,and what has
1361,33,happened
1362,33,to
1363,33,me?
1364,33,it's dark
1365,33,and cold
1366,33,out
1367,33,"here,"
1368,34,225 days under grass
1369,34,"and you know more than i,"
1370,34,"they have long taken your blood,"
1371,34,"you are a dry stick in a basket,"
1372,34,is this how it works?
1373,34,in this room
1374,34,the hours of love
1375,34,"still make shadows,"
1376,34,
1377,34,when you left
1378,34,you took almost
1379,34,"everything,"
1380,34,i kneel in the nights
1381,34,before tigers
1382,34,"that will not let me be,"
1383,34,
1384,34,what you were
1385,34,"will not happen again,"
1386,34,the tigers have found me
1387,34,"and i do not care,"
1388,35,"i pick up the skirt,"
1389,35,i pick up the sparkling beads
1390,35,"in black,"
1391,35,this thing that moved once
1392,35,"around flesh,"
1393,35,"and i call god a liar,"
1394,35,i say anything that moved
1395,35,like that
1396,35,or knew
1397,35,my name
1398,35,could never die
1399,35,"in the common verity of dying,"
1400,35,and i pick
1401,35,up her lovely
1402,35,"dress,"
1403,35,"all her loveliness gone,"
1404,35,"and i speak to all the gods,"
1405,35,"jewish gods, christ-gods,"
1406,35,"chips of blinking things,"
1407,35,"idols, pills, bread,"
1408,35,"fathoms, risks,"
1409,35,"knowledgeable surrender,"
1410,35,rats in the gravy of two gone quite mad
1411,35,"without a chance,"
1412,35,"hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance,"
1413,35,"i lean upon this,"
1414,35,i lean on all of this
1415,35,and i know
1416,35,her dress upon my arm
1417,35,but
1418,35,they will not
1419,35,"give her back to me,"
1420,36,he drank wine all night of the
1421,36,"28th, and he kept thinking of her,"
1422,36,the way she walked and talked and loved
1423,36,the way she told him things that seemed true
1424,36,"but were not, and he knew the color of each"
1425,36,of her dresses
1426,36,and her shoes-he knew the stock and curve of
1427,36,each heel
1428,36,"as well as the leg shaped by it,"
1429,36,
1430,36,"and she was out again and when he came home, and"
1431,36,"she'd come back with that special stink again,"
1432,36,and she did
1433,36,"she came in at 3 a,m in the morning"
1434,36,filthy like a dung eating swine
1435,36,and
1436,36,he took out a butchers knife
1437,36,and she screamed
1438,36,backing into the rooming house wall
1439,36,still pretty somehow
1440,36,in spite of love's reek
1441,36,"and he finished the glass of wine,"
1442,36,
1443,36,that yellow dress
1444,36,his favorite
1445,36,"and she screamed again,"
1446,36,
1447,36,and he took up the knife
1448,36,and unhooked his belt
1449,36,and tore away the cloth before her
1450,36,"and cut off his balls,"
1451,36,
1452,36,and carried them in his hands
1453,36,like apricots
1454,36,and flushed them down the
1455,36,toilet bowl
1456,36,and she kept screaming
1457,36,as the room became red
1458,36,
1459,36,god o god!
1460,36,what have you done?
1461,36,
1462,36,and he sat there holding 3 towels
1463,36,between his legs
1464,36,no caring now whether she left or
1465,36,stayed
1466,36,wore yellow or green or
1467,36,"anything at all,"
1468,36,
1469,36,and one hand holding and one hand
1470,36,lifting he poured
1471,36,another wine
1472,37,i can remember starving in a
1473,37,small room in a strange city
1474,37,"shades pulled down, listening to"
1475,37,classical music
1476,37,i was young i was so young it hurt like a knife
1477,37,inside
1478,37,because there was no alternative except to hide as long
1479,37,as possible--
1480,37,"not in self-pity but with dismay at my limited chance,"
1481,37,"trying to connect,"
1482,37,
1483,37,"the old composers -- mozart, bach, beethoven,"
1484,37,brahms were the only ones who spoke to me and

1936,48,a confused old man driving in the rain
1937,48,wondering where the good luck
1938,48,"went,"
1939,49,i met a genius on the train
1940,49,today
1941,49,"about 6 years old,"
1942,49,he sat beside me
1943,49,and as the train
1944,49,ran down along the coast
1945,49,we came to the ocean
1946,49,and then he looked at me
1947,49,"and said,"
1948,49,"it's not pretty,"
1949,49,
1950,49,it was the first time i'd
1951,49,realized
1952,49,"that,"
1953,50,"she's young, she said,"
1954,50,"but look at me,"
1955,50,"i have pretty ankles,"
1956,50,"and look at my wrists, i have pretty"
1957,50,wrists
1958,50,"o my god,"
1959,50,"i thought it was all working,"
1960,50,"and now it's her again,"
1961,50,"every time she phones you go crazy,"
1962,50,you told me it was over
1963,50,"you told me it was finished,"
1964,50,"listen, i've lived long enough to become a"
1965,50,"good woman,"
1966,50,why do you need a bad woman?
1967,50,"you need to be tortured, don't you?"
1968,50,you think life is rotten if somebody treats you
1969,50,"rotten it all fits,"
1970,50,doesn't it?
1971,50,"tell me, is that it? do you want to be treated like a"
1972,50,piece of shit?
1973,50,"and my son, my son was going to meet you,"
1974,50,i told my son
1975,50,"and i dropped all my lovers,"
1976,50,i stood up in a cafe and screamed
1977,50,"i'm in love,"
1978,50,"and now you've made a fool of me, , ,"
1979,50,"i'm sorry, i said, i'm really sorry,"
1980,50,"hold me, she said, will you please hold me?"
1981,50,"i've never been in one of these things before, i said,"
1982,50,"these triangles, , ,"
1983,50,"she got up and lit a cigarette, she was trembling all"
1984,50,"over,she paced up and down,wild and crazy,she had"
1985,50,"a small body,her arms were thin,very thin and when"
1986,50,she screamed and started beating me i held her
1987,50,"wrists and then i got it through the eyes,hatred,"
1988,50,"centuries deep and true,i was wrong and graceless and"
1989,50,"sick,all the things i had learned had been wasted,"
1990,50,there was no creature living as foul as i
1991,50,and all my poems were
1992,50,"false,"
1993,51,almost dawn
1994,51,blackbirds on the telephone wire
1995,51,waiting
1996,51,as i eat yesterday's
1997,51,forgotten sandwich
1998,51,"at 6 a,m,"
1999,51,"an a quiet sunday morning,"
2000,51,
2001,51,one shoe in the corner
2002,51,standing upright
2003,51,the other laying on it's
2004,51,"side,"
2005,51,
2006,51,"yes, some lives were made to be"
2007,51,"wasted,"
2008,52,there is always that space there
2009,52,just before they get to us
2010,52,that space
2011,52,that fine relaxer
2012,52,the breather
2013,52,while say
2014,52,flopping on a bed
2015,52,thinking of nothing
2016,52,or say
2017,52,pouring a glass of water from the
2018,52,spigot
2019,52,while entranced by
2020,52,nothing
2021,52,
2022,52,that
2023,52,gentle pure
2024,52,space
2025,52,
2026,52,it's worth
2027,52,
2028,52,centuries of
2029,52,existence
2030,52,
2031,52,say
2032,52,
2033,52,just to scratch your neck
2034,52,while looking out the window at
2035,52,a bare branch
2036,52,
2037,52,that space
2038,52,there
2039,52,before they get to us
2040,52,ensures
2041,52,that
2042,52,when they do
2043,52,they won't
2044,52,get it all
2045,52,
2046,52,"ever,"
2047,53,"cimen altinda gecen 225 gunden sonra benden daha cok sey biliyor olmalisin,"
2048,53,"kanini emip bitireli epey oldu, artik bir sepetteki kuru bir cubuksun,"
2049,53,bu isler boyle mi oluyor?
2050,53,"bu odada hala ask saatlerinin golgeleri var,"
2051,53,"birakip gittiginde asagi yukari herseyi alip gittin,"
2052,53,"geceleri beni ben olmaya koymayan kaplanlarin onunde diz cokuyorum,"
2053,53,"senin sen olman asla bir daha olmayacak,"
2054,53,"kaplanlar beni buldular ama artik umurumda bile degil,"
2055,53,translated by somebody
2056,54,"making love in the sun, in the morning sun"
2057,54,in a hotel room
2058,54,above the alley
2059,54,where poor men poke for bottles;
2060,54,making love in the sun
2061,54,"making love by a carpet redder than our blood,"
2062,54,making love while the boys sell headlines
2063,54,"and cadillacs,"
2064,54,making love by a photograph of paris
2065,54,"and an open pack of chesterfields,"
2066,54,making love while other men- poor folks-
2067,54,"work,"
2068,54,"that moment- to this, , ,"
2069,54,"may be years in the way they measure,"
2070,54,but it's only one sentence back in my mind-
2071,54,there are so many days
2072,54,when living stops and pulls up and sits
2073,54,"and waits like a train on the rails,"
2074,54,i pass the hotel at 8
2075,54,and at 5; there are cats in the alleys
2076,54,"and bottles and bums,"
2077,54,"and i look up at the window and think,"
2078,54,"i no longer know where you are,"
2079,54,and i walk on and wonder where
2080,54,the living goes
2081,54,"when it stops,"
2082,55,"either peace or happiness,"
2083,55,let it enfold you
2084,55,
2085,55,when i was a young man
2086,55,i felt these things were
2087,55,"dumb, unsophisticated,"
2088,55,"i had bad blood, a twisted"
2089,55,"mind, a precarious"
2090,55,"upbringing,"
2091,55,
2092,55,"i was hard as granite, i"
2093,55,leered at the
2094,55,"sun,"
2095,55,i trusted no man and
2096,55,especially no
2097,55,"woman,"
2098,55,
2099,55,i was living a hell in
2100,55,"small rooms, i broke"
2101,55,"things, smashed things,"
2102,55,"walked through glass,"
2103,55,"cursed,"
2104,55,"i challenged everything,"
2105,55,was continually being
2106,55,"evicted, jailed,in and"
2107,55,"out of fights, in and out"
2108,55,"of my mind,"
2109,55,women were something
2110,55,to screw and rail
2111,55,"at, i had no male"
2112,55,"friends,"
2113,55,
2114,55,i changed jobs and
2115,55,"cities, i hated holidays,"
2116,55,"babies, history,"
2117,55,"newspapers, museums,"
2118,55,"grandmothers,"
2119,55,"marriage, movies,"
2120,55,"spiders, garbagemen,"
2121,55,"english accents, spain,"
2122,55,"france, italy, walnuts and"
2123,55,the color
2124,55,"orange,"
2125,55,"algebra angered me,"
2126,55,"opera sickened me,"
2127,55,charlie chaplin was a
2128,55,fake
2129,55,and flowers were for
2130,55,"pansies,"
2131,55,
2132,55,peace an happiness to me
2133,55,were signs of
2134,55,"inferiority,"
2135,55,tenants of the weak
2136,55,an
2137,55,addled
2138,55,"mind,"
2139,55,
2140,55,but as i went on with
2141,55,"my alley fights,"
2142,55,"my suicidal years,"
2143,55,my passage through
2144,55,any number of
2145,55,women-it gradually
2146,55,began to occur to
2147,55,me
2148,55,that i wasn't different
2149,55,
2150,55,from the
2151,55,"others, i was the same,"
2152,55,
2153,55,they were all fulsome
2154,55,"with hatred,"
2155,55,glossed over with petty
2156,55,"grievances,"
2157,55,the men i fought in
2158,55,"alleys had hearts of stone,"
2159,55,"everybody was nudging,"
2160,55,"inching, cheating for"
2161,55,some insignificant
2162,55,"advantage,"
2163,55,the lie was the
2164,55,weapon and the
2165,55,plot was
2166,55,"empty,"
2167,55,darkness was the
2168,55,"dictator,"
2169,55,
2170,55,"cautiously, i allowed"
2171,55,myself to feel good
2172,55,"at times,"
2173,55,i found moments of
2174,55,peace in cheap
2175,55,rooms
2176,55,just staring at the
2177,55,knobs of some
2178,55,dresser
2179,55,or listening to the
2180,55,rain in the
2181,55,"dark,"
2182,55,the less i needed
2183,55,the better i
2184,55,"felt,"
2185,55,
2186,55,maybe the other life had worn me
2187,55,"down,"
2188,55,i no longer found
2189,55,glamour
2190,55,in topping somebody
2191,55,"in conversation,"
2192,55,or in mounting the
2193,55,body of some poor
2194,55,drunken female
2195,55,whose life had
2196,55,slipped away into
2197,55,"sorrow,"
2198,55,
2199,55,i could never accept
2200,55,"life as it was,"
2201,55,i could never gobble
2202,55,down all its
2203,55,poisons
2204,55,"but there were parts,"
2205,55,tenuous magic parts
2206,55,open for the
2207,55,"asking,"
2208,55,
2209,55,i re formulated
2210,55,"i don't know when,"
2211,55,"date, time, all"
2212,55,that
2213,55,but the change
2214,55,"occurred,"
2215,55,something in me
2216,55,"relaxed, smoothed"
2217,55,"out,"
2218,55,i no longer had to
2219,55,prove that i was a
2220,55,"man,"
2221,55,
2222,55,i didn't have to prove
2223,55,"anything,"
2224,55,
2225,55,"i began to see things,"
2226,55,coffee cups lined up
2227,55,behind a counter in a
2228,55,"cafe,"
2229,55,or a dog walking along
2230,55,"a sidewalk,"
2231,55,or the way the mouse
2232,55,on my dresser top
2233,55,stopped there
2234,55,"with its body,"
2235,55,"its ears,"
2236,55,"its nose,"
2237,55,"it was fixed,"
2238,55,a bit of life
2239,55,caught within itself
2240,55,and its eyes looked
2241,55,at me
2242,55,and they were
2243,55,"beautiful,"
2244,55,then- it was
2245,55,"gone,"
2246,55,
2247,55,"i began to feel good,"
2248,55,i began to feel good
2249,55,in the worst situations
2250,55,and there were plenty
2251,55,"of those,"
2252,55,"like say, the boss"
2253,55,"behind his desk,"
2254,55,he is going to have
2255,55,"to fire me,"
2256,55,
2257,55,i've missed too many
2258,55,"days,"
2259,55,he is dressed in a
2260,55,"suit, necktie, glasses,"
2261,55,"he says, i am going"
2262,55,to have to let you go
2263,55,
2264,55,it's all right i tell
2265,55,"him,"
2266,55,
2267,55,he must do what he
2268,55,"must do, he has a"
2269,55,"wife, a house, children,"
2270,55,"expenses, most probably"
2271,55,"a girlfriend,"
2272,55,
2273,55,i am sorry for him
2274,55,"he is caught,"
2275,55,
2276,55,i walk onto the blazing
2277,55,"sunshine,"
2278,55,the whole day is
2279,55,mine
2280,55,"temporally,"
2281,55,"anyhow,"
2282,55,
2283,55,the whole world is at the
2284,55,"throat of the world,"
2285,55,"everybody feels angry,"
2286,55,"short-changed, cheated,"
2287,55,"everybody is despondent,"
2288,55,disillusioned
2289,55,
2290,55,i welcomed shots of
2291,55,"peace, tattered shards of"
2292,55,"happiness,"
2293,55,
2294,55,i embraced that stuff
2295,55,"like the hottest number,"
2296,55,"like high heels, breasts,"
2297,55,"singing,the"
2298,55,"works,"
2299,55,
2300,55,"don't get me wrong,"
2301,55,there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism
2302,55,that overlooks all
2303,55,basic problems just for
2304,55,the sake of
2305,55,itself-
2306,55,this is a shield and a
2307,55,"sickness,"
2308,55,
2309,55,the knife got near my
2310,55,"throat again,"
2311,55,i almost turned on the
2312,55,gas
2313,55,again
2314,55,but when the good
2315,55,moments arrived
2316,55,again
2317,55,i didn't fight them off
2318,55,like an alley
2319,55,"adversary,"
2320,55,"i let them take me,"
2321,55,"i luxuriated in them,"
2322,55,i bade them welcome
2323,55,"home,"
2324,55,i even looked into
2325,55,the mirror
2326,55,once having thought
2327,55,myself to be
2328,55,"ugly,"
2329,55,i now liked what
2330,55,"i saw,almost"
2331,55,"handsome, yes,"
2332,55,a bit ripped and
2333,55,"ragged,"
2334,55,"scares, lumps,"
2335,55,"odd turns,"
2336,55,"but all in all,"
2337,55,"not too bad,"
2338,55,"almost handsome,"
2339,55,better at least than
2340,55,some of those movie
2341,55,star faces
2342,55,like the cheeks of
2343,55,a baby's
2344,55,"butt,"
2345,55,
2346,55,and finally i discovered
2347,55,real feelings of
2348,55,"others,"
2349,55,"unheralded,"
2350,55,"like lately,"
2351,55,"like this morning,"
2352,55,"as i was leaving,"
2353,55,"for the track,"
2354,55,"i saw my wife in bed,"
2355,55,just the
2356,55,shape of
2357,55,her head there
2358,55,not forgetting
2359,55,centuries of the living
2360,55,and the dead and
2361,55,"the dying,"
2362,55,"the pyramids,"
2363,55,mozart dead
2364,55,but his music still
2365,55,there in the
2366,55,"room, weeds growing,"
2367,55,"the earth turning,"
2368,55,the toteboard waiting for
2369,55,me
2370,55,i saw the shape of my
2371,55,"wife's head,"
2372,55,"she so still,"
2373,55,"i ached for her life,"
2374,55,just being there
2375,55,under the
2376,55,"covers,"
2377,55,
2378,55,"i kissed her in the,"
2379,55,"forehead,"
2380,55,"got down the stairway,"
2381,55,"got outside,"
2382,55,got into my marvelous
2383,55,"car,"
2384,55,"fixed the seatbelt,"
2385,55,backed out the
2386,55,"drive,"
2387,55,feeling warm to
2388,55,"the fingertips,"
2389,55,down to my
2390,55,foot on the gas
2391,55,"pedal,"
2392,55,i entered the world
2393,55,once
2394,55,"more,"
2395,55,drove down the
2396,55,hill
2397,55,past the houses
2398,55,full and empty
2399,55,of
2400,55,"people,"
2401,55,"i saw the mailman,"
2402,55,"honked,"
2403,55,he waved
2404,55,back
2405,55,"at me,"
2406,56,i cut the middle fingernail of the middle
2407,56,finger
2408,56,right hand
2409,56,real short
2410,56,and i began rubbing along her cunt
2411,56,as she sat upright in bed
2412,56,spreading lotion over her arms
2413,56,face
2414,56,and breasts
2415,56,"after bathing,"
2416,56,"then she lit a cigarette,"
2417,56,"don't let this put you off,"
2418,56,and smoked and continued to rub
2419,56,"the lotion on,"
2420,56,"i continued to rub the cunt,"
2421,56,"you want an apple? i asked,"
2422,56,"sure, she said, you got one?"
2423,56,but i got to her-
2424,56,she began to twist
2425,56,"then she rolled on her side,"
2426,56,she was getting wet and open
2427,56,"like a flower in the rain,"
2428,56,then she rolled on her stomach
2429,56,and her most beautiful ass
2430,56,looked up at me
2431,56,and i reached under and got the
2432,56,"cunt again,"
2433,56,she reached around and got my
2434,56,"cock, she rolled and twisted,"
2435,56,i mounted
2436,56,my face falling into the mass
2437,56,of red hair that overflowed
2438,56,from her head
2439,56,and my flattened cock entered
2440,56,"into the miracle,"
2441,56,later we joked about the lotion
2442,56,"and the cigarette and the apple,"
2443,56,then i went out and got some chicken
2444,56,and shrimp and french fries and buns
2445,56,and mashed potatoes and gravy and
2446,56,"cole slaw,and we ate,she told me"
2447,56,how good she felt and i told her
2448,56,how good i felt and we
2449,56,ate the chicken and the shrimp and the
2450,56,french fries and the buns and the
2451,56,mashed potatoes and the gravy and
2452,56,"the cole slaw too,"
2453,57,it sits outside my window now
2454,57,like and old woman going to market;
2455,57,"it sits and watches me,"
2456,57,it sweats nervously
2457,57,through wire and fog and dog-bark
2458,57,until suddenly
2459,57,i slam the screen with a newspaper
2460,57,like slapping at a fly
2461,57,and you could hear the scream
2462,57,"over this plain city,"
2463,57,"and then it left,"
2464,57,
2465,57,the way to end a poem
2466,57,like this
2467,57,is to become suddenly
2468,57,"quiet,"
2469,58,once
2470,58,we were young
2471,58,at this
2472,58,"machine, , ,"
2473,58,drinking
2474,58,smoking
2475,58,typing
2476,58,it was a most
2477,58,splendid
2478,58,miraculous
2479,58,time
2480,58,still
2481,58,is
2482,58,only now
2483,58,instead of
2484,58,moving toward
2485,58,time
2486,58,it
2487,58,moves toward
2488,58,us
2489,58,makes each word
2490,58,drill
2491,58,into the
2492,58,paper
2493,58,clear
2494,58,fast
2495,58,hard
2496,58,feeding a
2497,58,closing
2498,58,"space,"
2499,59,i am in this low-slung sports car
2500,59,"painted a deep, rich yellow"
2501,59,"driving under an italian sun,"
2502,59,"i have a british accent,"
2503,59,i'm wearing dark shades
2504,59,"an expensive silk shirt,"
2505,59,there's no dirt under my
2506,59,"fingernails,"
2507,59,the radio plays vivaldi
2508,59,and there are two women with
2509,59,me
2510,59,one with raven hair
2511,59,"the other a blonde,"
2512,59,they have small breasts and
2513,59,beautiful legs
2514,59,and they laugh at everything i
2515,59,"say,"
2516,59,
2517,59,as we drive up a steep road
2518,59,the blonde squeezes my leg
2519,59,and nestles closer
2520,59,while raven hair
2521,59,leans across and nibbles my
2522,59,"ear,"
2523,59,
2524,59,we stop for lunch at a quaint
2525,59,"rustic inn,"
2526,59,there is more laughter
2527,59,before lunch
2528,59,during lunch and after
2529,59,"lunch,"
2530,59,
2531,59,after lunch we will have a
2532,59,flat tire on the other side of
2533,59,the mountain
2534,59,and the blonde will change the
2535,59,tire
2536,59,while
2537,59,raven hair
2538,59,photographs me
2539,59,lighting my pipe
2540,59,leaning against a tree
2541,59,the perfect background
2542,59,perfectly at peace
2543,59,with
2544,59,sunlight
2545,59,flowers
2546,59,clouds
2547,59,birds

2553,60,                      and
2554,60,           i can't even say
2555,60,"                      mama,"
2556,60,                         and
2557,60,the dogs run by and stop and piss
2558,60,on my stone; i get it all
2559,60,except the sun
2560,60,and my suit is looking
2561,60,                                  bad
2562,60,and yesterday
2563,60,                       the last of my left
2564,60,                                             arm           gone
2565,60,"very little left, all harp-like"
2566,60,"without music,"
2567,60,
2568,60,at least a drunk
2569,60,in bed with a cigarette
2570,60,might cause 5 fire
2571,60,                            engines and
2572,60,"                            33 men,"

2589,61,on the carpet-
2590,61,out the door
2591,61,"picking a flower, ha!"
2592,61,"an old man,"
2593,61,"battle-wrecked,"
2594,61,emerges from his
2595,61,chair
2596,61,and she looks at me
2597,61,but only sees
2598,61,"love,"
2599,61,"ha!, and i become"
2600,61,quick with the world
2601,61,and love right back
2602,61,just like i was meant
2603,61,"to do,"
2604,62,the history of melancholia
2605,62,"includes all of us,"
2606,62,"me, i writhe in dirty sheets"
2607,62,while staring at blue walls
2608,62,"and nothing,"
2609,62,i have gotten so used to melancholia
2610,62,that
2611,62,i greet it like an old
2612,62,"friend,"
2613,62,i will now do 15 minutes of grieving
2614,62,"for the lost redhead,"
2615,62,"i tell the gods,"
2616,62,i do it and feel quite bad
2617,62,"quite sad,"
2618,62,then i rise
2619,62,cleansed
2620,62,even though nothing
2621,62,"is solved,"
2622,62,that's what i get for kicking
2623,62,"religion in the ass,"
2624,62,i should have kicked the redhead
2625,62,in the ass
2626,62,where her brains and her bread and
2627,62,butter are
2628,62,"at ,"
2629,62,"but, no, i've felt sad"
2630,62,"about everything,"
2631,62,the lost redhead was just another
2632,62,smash in a lifelong
2633,62,"loss ,"
2634,62,i listen to drums on the radio now
2635,62,"and grin,"
2636,62,there is something wrong with me
2637,62,besides
2638,62,"melancholia,"
2639,63,a girlfriend came in
2640,63,built me a bed
2641,63,scrubbed and waxed the kitchen floor
2642,63,scrubbed the walls
2643,63,vacuumed
2644,63,cleaned the toilet
2645,63,the bathtub
2646,63,scrubbed the bathroom floor
2647,63,and cut my toenails and
2648,63,"my hair,"
2649,63,then
2650,63,all on the same day
2651,63,the plumber came and fixed the kitchen faucet
2652,63,and the toilet
2653,63,and the gas man fixed the heater
2654,63,"and the phone man fixed the phone,"
2655,63,"now i sit in all this perfection,"
2656,63,"it is quiet,"
2657,63,"i have broken off with all 3 of my girlfriends,"
2658,63,i felt better when everything was in
2659,63,"disorder,"
2660,63,"it will take me some months to get back to normal,"
2661,63,"i can't even find a roach to commune with,"
2662,63,"i have lost my rhythm,"
2663,63,"i can't sleep,"
2664,63,"i can't eat,"
2665,63,i have been robbed of
2666,63,"my filth,"
2667,64,"what? they say, you got a"
2668,64,computer?
2669,64,
2670,64,it's like i have sold out to
2671,64,"the enemy,"
2672,64,
2673,64,i had no idea so many
2674,64,people were prejudiced
2675,64,against
2676,64,"computers,"
2677,64,
2678,64,even two editors have
2679,64,written me letters about
2680,64,"the computer,"
2681,64,
2682,64,one disparaged the
2683,64,computer in a mild and
2684,64,"superior way,"
2685,64,the other seemed
2686,64,genuinely
2687,64,"pissed,"
2688,64,
2689,64,i am aware that a
2690,64,computer can't create
2691,64,"a poem,"
2692,64,but neither can a
2693,64,"typewriter,"
2694,64,
2695,64,"yet, still, once or"
2696,64,twice a week
2697,64,"i hear,"
2698,64,what?
2699,64,you have a
2700,64,computer?
2701,64,you?
2702,64,
2703,64,"yes, i do"
2704,64,and i sit up here
2705,64,almost every
2706,64,"night,"
2707,64,sometimes with
2708,64,beer or
2709,64,"wine,"
2710,64,sometimes
2711,64,without
2712,64,and i work the
2713,64,"computer,"
2714,64,the damn thing
2715,64,even corrects
2716,64,"my spelling,"
2717,64,
2718,64,and the poems
2719,64,come flying
2720,64,"out,"
2721,64,better than
2722,64,"ever,"
2723,64,
2724,64,i have no
2725,64,idea what causes
2726,64,all this
2727,64,computer
2728,64,"prejudice,"
2729,64,
2730,64,me?
2731,64,i want to go
2732,64,the next step
2733,64,beyond the
2734,64,"computer,"
2735,64,i'm sure it's
2736,64,"there,"
2737,64,
2738,64,and when i get
2739,64,"it,"
2740,64,"they'll say,"
2741,64,"hey, you hear,"
2742,64,chinaski got a
2743,64,space-biter!
2744,64,
2745,64,what?
2746,64,
2747,64,"yes, it's true!"
2748,64,
2749,64,i can't believe
2750,64,it!
2751,64,
2752,64,and i'll also have
2753,64,some beer or
2754,64,some wine
2755,64,or maybe nothing
2756,64,at all
2757,64,and i'll be
2758,64,85 years old
2759,64,driving it home
2760,64,to
2761,64,you and me
2762,64,and to the little girl
2763,64,who lost her
2764,64,"sheep,"
2765,64,or her
2766,64,"computer,"
2767,65,was a truly amazing man
2768,65,he pretended to be
2769,65,rich
2770,65,even though we lived on beans and mush and weenies
2771,65,"when we sat down to eat, he said,"
2772,65,"not everybody can eat like this,"
2773,65,
2774,65,and because he wanted to be rich or because he actually
2775,65,thought he was rich
2776,65,he always voted republican
2777,65,and he voted for hoover against roosevelt
2778,65,and he lost
2779,65,and then he voted for alf landon against roosevelt
2780,65,and he lost again
2781,65,"saying, i don't know what this world is coming to,"
2782,65,now we've got that god damned red in there again
2783,65,and the russians will be in our backyard next!
2784,65,
2785,65,i think it was my father who made me decide to
2786,65,"become a bum,"
2787,65,i decided that if a man like that wants to be rich
2788,65,"then i want to be poor,"
2789,65,
2790,65,"and i became a bum,"
2791,65,i lived on nickles and dimes and in cheap rooms and
2792,65,"on park benches,"
2793,65,"i thought maybe the bums knew something,"
2794,65,
2795,65,but i found out that most of the bums wanted to be
2796,65,"rich too,"
2797,65,"they had just failed at that,"
2798,65,
2799,65,so caught between my father and the bums
2800,65,i had no place to go
2801,65,"and i went there fast and slow,"
2802,65,never voted republican
2803,65,"never voted,"
2804,65,
2805,65,buried him
2806,65,like an oddity of the earth
2807,65,like a hundred thousand oddities
2808,65,"like millions of other oddities,"
2809,65,"wasted,"
2810,66,when i look back now
2811,66,
2812,66,at the abuse i took from
2813,66,
2814,66,her
2815,66,
2816,66,i feel shame that i was so
2817,66,
2818,66,"innocent,"
2819,66,
2820,66,but i must say
2821,66,
2822,66,she did match me drink for
2823,66,
2824,66,"drink,"
2825,66,
2826,66,and i realized that her life
2827,66,
2828,66,her feelings for things
2829,66,
2830,66,had been ruined
2831,66,
2832,66,along the way
2833,66,
2834,66,and that i was no mare than a
2835,66,
2836,66,temporary
2837,66,
2838,66,companion;
2839,66,
2840,66,she was ten years older
2841,66,
2842,66,and mortally hurt by the past
2843,66,
2844,66,and the present;
2845,66,
2846,66,"she treated me badly,"
2847,66,
2848,66,"desertion, other"
2849,66,
2850,66,men;
2851,66,
2852,66,she brought me immense
2853,66,
2854,66,"pain,"
2855,66,
2856,66,continually;
2857,66,
2858,66,"she lied, stole;"
2859,66,
2860,66,"there was desertion,"
2861,66,
2862,66,"other men,"
2863,66,
2864,66,yet we had our moments; and
2865,66,
2866,66,our little soap opera ended
2867,66,
2868,66,with her in a coma
2869,66,
2870,66,"in the hospital,"
2871,66,
2872,66,and i sat at her bed
2873,66,
2874,66,for hours
2875,66,
2876,66,"talking to her,"
2877,66,
2878,66,and then she opened her eyes
2879,66,
2880,66,"and saw me,"
2881,66,
2882,66,"i knew it would be you,"
2883,66,
2884,66,"she said,"
2885,66,
2886,66,then she closed her
2887,66,
2888,66,"eyes,"
2889,66,
2890,66,the next day she was
2891,66,
2892,66,"dead,"
2893,66,
2894,66,i drank alone
2895,66,
2896,66,for two years
2897,66,
2898,66,"after that,"
2899,67,—he's a dandy
2900,67,—small moustache
2901,67,—usually sucking on a cigar
2902,67,
2903,67,he tends to lean into cars as he
2904,67,transacts business
2905,67,
2906,67,"first time i met him, he said,"
2907,67,hey! ya gonna make a
2908,67,killin'?
2909,67,
2910,67,"maybe, i answered,"
2911,67,
2912,67,"next meeting it was,"
2913,67,"hey, ramrod! what's"
2914,67,happening?
2915,67,
2916,67,"very little, i told"
2917,67,"him,"
2918,67,
2919,67,next time i had my girlfriend with me
2920,67,and he just
2921,67,"grinned,"
2922,67,
2923,67,next time i was
2924,67,"alone,"
2925,67,
2926,67,"hey, he asked, where's the young"
2927,67,chick?
2928,67,
2929,67,"i left her at home,,"
2930,67,
2931,67,bullshit! i'll bet she dumped
2932,67,you!
2933,67,
2934,67,and the next time
2935,67,"he really leaned into the car,"
2936,67,
2937,67,what's a guy like you doing driving a
2938,67,bmw! i'll bet you inherited your
2939,67,"money, you didn't get this car with your"
2940,67,brains!
2941,67,
2942,67,how'd you guess? i
2943,67,"answered,"
2944,67,
2945,67,"that was some weeks ago,"
2946,67,"i haven't seen him lately,"
2947,67,"feilow like that, chances are he just moved on"
2948,67,to better
2949,67,"things,"
2950,68,i read last saturday in the
2951,68,redwoods outside of santa cruz
2952,68,and i was about 3/4's finished
2953,68,when i heard a long high scream
2954,68,and a quite attractive
2955,68,young girl came running toward me
2956,68,long gown & divine eyes of fire
2957,68,and she leaped up on the stage
2958,68,"and screamed, i want you!"
2959,68,i want you! take me! take
2960,68,me!
2961,68,"i told her, look, get the hell"
2962,68,"away from me,"
2963,68,but she kept tearing at my
2964,68,clothing and throwing herself
2965,68,"at me,"
2966,68,"where were you, i"
2967,68,"asked her, when i was living"
2968,68,on one candy bar a day and
2969,68,sending short stories to the
2970,68,atlantic monthly?
2971,68,she grabbed my balls and almost
2972,68,"twisted them off, her kisses"
2973,68,"tasted like shitsoup,"
2974,68,2 women jumped up on the stage
2975,68,and
2976,68,carried her off into the
2977,68,"woods,"
2978,68,i could still hear her screams
2979,68,"as i began the next poem,"
2980,68,"maybe, i thought, i should have"
2981,68,taken her on stage in front
2982,68,"of all those eyes,"
2983,68,but one can never be sure
2984,68,whether it's good poetry or
2985,68,"bad acid,"
2986,69,i was fairly drunk when it
2987,69,began and i took out my bottle and used it
2988,69,"along the way, i was reading a week or two after"
2989,69,kandel and i did not look quite as
2990,69,pretty but
2991,69,i brought it off and we
2992,69,"ended up at the webbs, 6, 8, 10 of"
2993,69,"us, and i drank scotch, wine, beer, tequila"
2994,69,and noticed a nice one sitting next to me -
2995,69,"one tooth missing when she smiled,"
2996,69,"lovely, and i put my arm around her"
2997,69,"and began loading her with bullshit,"
2998,69,"when i awakened at 10 a,m, the next morning"
2999,69,i was in a strange house
3000,69,in bed with this
3001,69,"woman, she was asleep but looked"
3002,69,"familiar,"
3003,69,i got up and here was one kid running around in a
3004,69,crib and another one running around the floor in
3005,69,"pajamas, i picked up a letter addressed to one"
3006,69,"betsy r,, so i went back and said,"
3007,69,"hey, betsy, there are kids running around all over"
3008,69,"this place,"
3009,69,"oh hank, damn it, i'm sick, i want to sleep, not"
3010,69,"rap,"
3011,69,"but look, the ,"
3012,69,make yourself some
3013,69,"coffee,"
3014,69,i put the pot on and the little boy ran up in his
3015,69,"pajamas, i found a shirt and some pants and some"
3016,69,shoes and
3017,69,"dressed him,"
3018,69,"then i cleaned a bottle with hot water, filled it"
3019,69,with milk and gave it to the kid in the
3020,69,"crib, he went for"
3021,69,"it,"
3022,69,then i went in and squeezed her
3023,69,"hand, i've got to go, are you all"
3024,69,right ?
3025,69,"yes, a little sick, but please don't feel"
3026,69,"bad,"
3027,69,i called a yellow cab and we went back across
3028,69,"town,"
3029,69,is this what happened to
3030,69,"d, thomas ? i thought,"
3031,69,if a man didn't think too much he could be proud of his little
3032,69,conquests -
3033,69,except that the women were better than we - asking nothing
3034,69,as we squirted our poetry
3035,69,our bullshit our
3036,69,sperm to
3037,69,"them,"
3038,69,we were sick poets sick
3039,69,"people,"
3040,69,across town i knocked on the door of my host and
3041,69,"hostess,"
3042,69,what happened ? they
3043,69,"asked,"
3044,69,"nothing, got"
3045,69,"lost,"
3046,69,they sat a beer in front of me
3047,69,and i drank it as if i were
3048,69,"wordly,"
3049,69,a piece-of-ass
3050,69,any-night
3051,69,anywhere
3052,69,"type,"
3053,69,somebody got a
3054,69,"cigarette ? i asked,"
3055,69,"sure, sure,"
3056,69,"i lit up and asked,"
3057,69,heard from creely
3058,69,lately ?
3059,69,not giving a damn whether they had or
3060,69,"not,"
3061,70,"not much chance,"
3062,70,completely cut loose from
3063,70,"purpose,"
3064,70,he was a young man
3065,70,riding a bus
3066,70,through north carolina
3067,70,on the way to somewhere
3068,70,and it began to snow
3069,70,and the bus stopped
3070,70,at a little cafe
3071,70,in the hills
3072,70,and the passengers
3073,70,"entered,"
3074,70,he sat at the counter
3075,70,"with the others,"
3076,70,he ordered and the
3077,70,"food arrived,"
3078,70,the meal was
3079,70,particularly
3080,70,good
3081,70,and the
3082,70,"coffee,"
3083,70,the waitress was
3084,70,unlike the women
3085,70,he had
3086,70,"known,"
3087,70,"she was unaffected,"
3088,70,there was a natural
3089,70,humor which came
3090,70,"from her,"
3091,70,the fry cook said
3092,70,"crazy things,"
3093,70,"the dishwasher,"
3094,70,"in back,"
3095,70,"laughed, a good"
3096,70,clean
3097,70,pleasant
3098,70,"laugh,"
3099,70,the young man watched
3100,70,the snow through the
3101,70,"windows,"
3102,70,he wanted to stay
3103,70,in that cafe
3104,70,"forever,"
3105,70,the curious feeling
3106,70,swam through him
3107,70,that everything
3108,70,was
3109,70,beautiful
3110,70,"there,"
3111,70,that it would always
3112,70,stay beautiful
3113,70,"there,"
3114,70,then the bus driver
3115,70,told the passengers
3116,70,that it was time
3117,70,"to board,"
3118,70,the young man
3119,70,"thought, i'll just sit"
3120,70,"here, i'll just stay"
3121,70,"here,"
3122,70,but then
3123,70,he rose and followed
3124,70,the others into the
3125,70,"bus,"
3126,70,he found his seat
3127,70,and looked at the cafe
3128,70,through the bus
3129,70,"window,"
3130,70,then the bus moved
3131,70,"off, down a curve,"
3132,70,"downward, out of"
3133,70,"the hills,"
3134,70,the young man
3135,70,looked straight
3136,70,"forward,"
3137,70,he heard the other
3138,70,passengers
3139,70,speaking
3140,70,"of other things,"
3141,70,or they were
3142,70,reading
3143,70,or
3144,70,attempting to
3145,70,"sleep,"
3146,70,they had not
3147,70,noticed
3148,70,the
3149,70,"magic,"
3150,70,the young man
3151,70,put his head to
3152,70,"one side,"
3153,70,closed his
3154,70,"eyes,"
3155,70,pretended to
3156,70,"sleep,"
3157,70,there was nothing
3158,70,else to do-
3159,70,just to listen to the
3160,70,sound of the
3161,70,"engine,"
3162,70,the sound of the
3163,70,tires
3164,70,in the
3165,70,"snow,"
3166,71,i'll settle for the 6 horse
3167,71,on a rainy afternoon
3168,71,a paper cup of coffee
3169,71,in my hand
3170,71,"a little way to go,"
3171,71,the wind twirling out
3172,71,small wrens from
3173,71,"the upper grandstand roof,"
3174,71,the jocks coming out
3175,71,for a middle race
3176,71,silent
3177,71,and the easy rain making
3178,71,everything
3179,71,at once
3180,71,"almost alike,"
3181,71,the horses at peace with
3182,71,each other
3183,71,before the drunken war
3184,71,and i am under the grandstand
3185,71,feeling for
3186,71,cigarettes
3187,71,"settling for coffee,"
3188,71,then the horses walk by
3189,71,taking their little men
3190,71,away-
3191,71,it is funeral and graceful
3192,71,and glad
3193,71,like the opening
3194,71,"of flowers,"
3195,72,i sit here on the 2nd floor
3196,72,hunched over in yellow
3197,72,pajamas
3198,72,still pretending to be
3199,72,"a writer,"
3200,72,"some damned gall,"
3201,72,"at 71,"
3202,72,my brain cells eaten
3203,72,away by
3204,72,"life,"
3205,72,rows of books
3206,72,"behind me,"
3207,72,i scratch my thinning
3208,72,hair
3209,72,and search for the
3210,72,"word,"
3211,72,for decades now
3212,72,i have infuriated the
3213,72,"ladies,"
3214,72,"the critics,"
3215,72,the university
3216,72,"suck-toads,"
3217,72,they all will soon have
3218,72,their time to
3219,72,"celebrate,"
3220,72,"terribly overrated,"
3221,72,"gross,"
3222,72,"an aberration,"
3223,72,my hands sink into the
3224,72,keyboard
3225,72,of my
3226,72,"macintosh,"
3227,72,it's the same old
3228,72,con
3229,72,that scraped me
3230,72,off the streets and
3231,72,"park benches,"
3232,72,the same simple
3233,72,line
3234,72,i learned in those
3235,72,"cheap rooms,"
3236,72,i can't let
3237,72,"go,"
3238,72,sitting here
3239,72,on this 2nd floor
3240,72,hunched over in yellow
3241,72,pajamas
3242,72,still pretending to be
3243,72,"a writer,"
3244,72,"the gods smile down,"

3252,73,
3253,73,"if it doesn't come, coax it out with a"
3254,73,"laxative, get your name in lights,"

3257,73,
3258,73,"keep it coming like a miracle,"
3259,73,
3260,73,"ah christ, writers are the most sickening"
3261,73,of all the louts!
3262,73,"yellow-toothed, slump-shouldered,"
3263,73,"gutless, flea-bitten and"
3264,73,"obvious , , , in tinker-toy rooms"
3265,73,with their flabby hearts
3266,73,they tell us
3267,73,what's wrong with the world-
3268,73,as if we didn't know that a cop's club
3269,73,can crack the head
3270,73,and that war is a dirtier game than
3271,73,"marriage , , ,"
3272,73,or down in a basement bar
3273,73,hiding from a wife who doesn't appreciate him
3274,73,and children he doesn't
3275,73,want
3276,73,he tells us that his heart is drowning in
3277,73,"vomit, hell, all our hearts are drowning in vomit,"
3278,73,"in pork salt, in bad verse, in soggy"
3279,73,"love,"
3280,73,but he thinks he's alone and
3281,73,he thinks he's special and he thinks he's rimbaud
3282,73,and he thinks he's
3283,73,"pound,"
3284,73,
3285,73,and death! how about death? did you know
3286,73,"that we all have to die? even keats died, even"
3287,73,milton!
3288,73,"and d, thomas-they killed him, of course,"
3289,73,thomas didn't want all those free drinks
3290,73,all that free pussy-
3291,73,"they , , , forced it on him"
3292,73,when they should have left him alone so he could
3293,73,write write write!
3294,73,
3295,73,"poets,"
3296,73,
3297,73,and there's another
3298,73,"type, i've met them at their country"
3299,73,places don't ask me what i was doing there because
3300,73,"i don't know,"
3301,73,
3302,73,they were born with money and
3303,73,they don't have to dirty their hands in
3304,73,slaughterhouses or washing
3305,73,dishes in grease joints or
3306,73,"driving cabs or pimping or selling pot,"
3307,73,
3308,73,this gives them time to understand
3309,73,"life,"
3310,73,
3311,73,they walk in with their cocktail glass
3312,73,held about heart high
3313,73,and when they drink they just
3314,73,"sip,"
3315,73,
3316,73,you are drinking green beer which you
3317,73,brought with you
3318,73,because you have found out through the years
3319,73,that rich bastards are tight-
3320,73,they use 5 cent stamps instead of airmail
3321,73,they promise to have all sorts of goodies ready
3322,73,upon your arrival
3323,73,from gallons of whisky to
3324,73,"50 cent cigars, but it's never"
3325,73,"there,"
3326,73,and they hide their women from you-
3327,73,"their wives, x-wives, daughters, maids, so forth,"
3328,73,because they've read your poems and
3329,73,figure all you want to do is fuck everybody and
3330,73,"everything, which once might have been"
3331,73,true but is no longer quite
3332,73,"true,"
3333,73,
3334,73,and-
3335,73,"he writes too,"
3336,73,"poetry, of"
3337,73,"course, everybody"
3338,73,writes
3339,73,"poetry,"
3340,73,
3341,73,he has plenty of time and a
3342,73,postoffice box in town
3343,73,and he drives there 3 or 4 times a day
3344,73,looking and hoping for accepted
3345,73,"poems,"
3346,73,
3347,73,he thinks that poverty is a weakness of the
3348,73,"soul,"
3349,73,
3350,73,he thinks your mind is ill because you are
3351,73,drunk all the time and have to work in a
3352,73,factory 10 or 12 hours a
3353,73,"night,"
3354,73,
3355,73,"he brings his wife in, a beauty, stolen from a"
3356,73,poorer rich
3357,73,"man,"
3358,73,he lets you gaze for 30 seconds
3359,73,then hustles her
3360,73,"out, she has been crying for some"
3361,73,"reason,"
3362,73,
3363,73,you've got 3 or 4 days to linger in the
3364,73,"guesthouse he says,"
3365,73,come on over to dinner
3366,73,"sometime,"
3367,73,but he doesn't say when or
3368,73,"where, and then you find out that you are not even"
3369,73,"in his house,"
3370,73,
3371,73,you are in
3372,73,one of his houses but
3373,73,his house is somewhere
3374,73,else-
3375,73,you don't know
3376,73,"where,"
3377,73,
3378,73,he even has x-wives in some of his
3379,73,"houses,"
3380,73,
3381,73,his main concern is to keep his x-wives away from
3382,73,"you, he doesn't want to give up a"
3383,73,"damn thing, and you can't blame him,"
3384,73,"his x-wives are all young, stolen, kept,"
3385,73,"talented, well-dressed, schooled, with"
3386,73,"varying french-german accents,"
3387,73,
3388,73,"and!, they"
3389,73,"write poetry too, or"
3390,73,"paint, or"
3391,73,"fuck,"
3392,73,
3393,73,but his big problem is to get down to that mail
3394,73,box in town to get back his
3395,73,rejected poems
3396,73,and to keep his eye on all the other mail boxes
3397,73,in all his other
3398,73,"houses,"
3399,73,
3400,73,"meanwhile, the starving indians"
3401,73,sell beads and baskets in the streets of the small desert
3402,73,"town,"
3403,73,
3404,73,the indians are not allowed in his houses
3405,73,not so much because they are a fuck-threat
3406,73,but because they are
3407,73,dirty and
3408,73,"ignorant, dirty? i look down at my shirt"
3409,73,"with the beerstain on the front,"
3410,73,ignorant? i light a 6 cent cigar and
3411,73,forget about
3412,73,"it,"
3413,73,
3414,73,he or they or somebody was supposed to meet me at
3415,73,the
3416,73,"train station,"
3417,73,
3418,73,"of course, they weren't"
3419,73,"there, we'll be there to meet the great"
3420,73,poet!
3421,73,
3422,73,"well, i looked around and didn't see any"
3423,73,"great poet, besides it was 7 a,m, and"
3424,73,"40 degrees, those things"
3425,73,"happen, the trouble was there were no"
3426,73,"bars open, nothing open, not even a"
3427,73,"jail,"

3432,73,"way, he won't tell me whether i am crazy or"
3433,73,not-i don't have the

3436,73,he walks out with his cocktail glass

3438,73,then suddenly comes walking back in
3439,73,unannounced
3440,73,with the same cocktail glass
3441,73,to make sure i haven't gotten hold of
3442,73,something more precious than
3443,73,"life itself,"
3444,73,
3445,73,my cheap green beer is killing
3446,73,"me, he shows heart hurrah and"
3447,73,gives me a little pill that stops my
3448,73,"gagging,"
3449,73,but nothing decent to
3450,73,"drink,"
3451,73,
3452,73,he'd bought a small 6 pack
3453,73,for my arrival but that was gone in an
3454,73,hour and 15
3455,73,"minutes,"
3456,73,
3457,73,"i'll buy you barrels of beer, he had"
3458,73,"said,"
3459,73,
3460,73,i used his phone one of his phones
3461,73,to get deliveries of beer and
3462,73,"cheap whisky, the town was ten miles away,"
3463,73,"downhill, i peeled my poor dollars from my poor"
3464,73,"roll, and the boy needed a tip, of"
3465,73,"course,"
3466,73,
3467,73,the way it was shaping up i could see that i was
3468,73,"hardly dylan thomas yet, not even"
3469,73,"robert creeley, certainly creeley wouldn't have"
3470,73,had beerstains on his
3471,73,"shirt,"
3472,73,
3473,73,"anyhow, when i finally got hold of one of his"
3474,73,x-wives i was too drunk to
3475,73,"make it,"
3476,73,
3477,73,"scared too, sure, i imagined him peering"
3478,73,through the window-
3479,73,he didn't want to give up a damn thing-
3480,73,and
3481,73,leveling the luger while i was
3482,73,working
3483,73,while the march to the gallows was playing over
3484,73,the muzak
3485,73,and shooting me in the ass first and
3486,73,my poor brain
3487,73,"later,"
3488,73,
3489,73,"an intruder, i could hear him telling them,"
3490,73,"ravishing one of my helpless x-wives,"
3491,73,
3492,73,i see him published in some of the magazines
3493,73,"now, not very good stuff,"
3494,73,
3495,73,a poem about me
3496,73,"too, the polack,"
3497,73,
3498,73,"the polack whines too much, the polack whines about his"
3499,73,"country, other countries, all countries, the polack"
3500,73,"works overtime in a factory like a fool, among other"
3501,73,"fools with pre-drained spirits,"
3502,73,the polack drinks seas of green beer
3503,73,"full of acid, the polack has an ulcerated"
3504,73,"hemorrhoid, the polack picks on fags"
3505,73,"fragile fags, the polack hates his"
3506,73,"wife, hates his daughter, his daughter will become"
3507,73,"an alcoholic, a prostitute, the polack has an"
3508,73,"obese burned out wife, the polack has a"
3509,73,"spastic gut, the polack has a"
3510,73,"rectal brain,"
3511,73,
3512,73,"thank you, doctor and poet, any charge for"
3513,73,this? i know i still owe you for the
3514,73,"pill,"
3515,73,
3516,73,your poem is not too good
3517,73,"but at least i got your starch up,"
3518,73,most of your stuff is about as lively as a
3519,73,wet and deflated
3520,73,"beachball, but it is your round, you've won a round,"
3521,73,going to invite me out this
3522,73,summer? i might scrape up
3523,73,"trainfare, got an indian friend who'd like to meet"
3524,73,"you and yours, he swears he's got the biggest"
3525,73,"pecker in the state of california,"
3526,73,
3527,73,and guess what?
3528,73,he writes
3529,73,poetry
3530,73,too!
3531,74,there are worse things than
3532,74,being alone
3533,74,but it often takes decades
3534,74,to realize this
3535,74,and most often
3536,74,when you do
3537,74,it's too late
3538,74,and there's nothing worse
3539,74,than
3540,74,"too late,"
3541,75,they talk down through
3542,75,"the centuries to us,"
3543,75,"and this we need more and more,"
3544,75,the statues and paintings
3545,75,in midnight age
3546,75,as we go along
3547,75,"holding dead hands,"
3548,75,
3549,75,and we would say
3550,75,"rather than delude the knowing,"
3551,75,"a damn good show,"
3552,75,"but hardly enough for a horse to eat,"
3553,75,and out on the sunshine street where
3554,75,eyes are dabbled in metazoan faces
3555,75,i decide again
3556,75,that in theses centuries
3557,75,they have done very well
3558,75,considering the nature of their
3559,75,"brothers,"
3560,75,it's more than good
3561,75,"that some of them,"
3562,75,closer really to the field-mouse than
3563,75,falcon
3564,75,"have been bold enough to try,"
3565,76,i laugh sometimes when i think about
3566,76,say
3567,76,céline at a typewriter
3568,76,"or dostoevsky,"
3569,76,"or hamsun,"
3570,76,"ordinary men with feet, ears, eyes,"
3571,76,ordinary men with hair on their heads
3572,76,sitting there typing words
3573,76,while having difficulties with life
3574,76,"while being puzzled almost to madness,"
3575,76,
3576,76,dostoevsky gets up
3577,76,"he leaves the machine to piss,"
3578,76,comes back
3579,76,drinks a glass of milk and thinks about
3580,76,the casino and
3581,76,"the roulette wheel,"
3582,76,
3583,76,"céline stops, gets up, walks to the"
3584,76,"window, looks out, thinks, my last patient"
3585,76,"died today, i won't have to make any more"
3586,76,"visits there,"
3587,76,when i saw him last
3588,76,he paid his doctor bill;
3589,76,"it's those who don't pay their bills,"
3590,76,"they live on and on,"
3591,76,"céline walks back, sits down at the"
3592,76,machine
3593,76,is still for a good two minutes
3594,76,"then begins to type,"
3595,76,
3596,76,"hamsun stands over his machine thinking,"
3597,76,i wonder if they are going to believe
3598,76,all these things i write?
3599,76,"he sits down, begins to type,"
3600,76,he doesn't know what a writer's block
3601,76,"is,"
3602,76,he's a prolific son-of-a-bitch
3603,76,damn near as magnificent as
3604,76,"the sun,"
3605,76,"he types away,"
3606,76,
3607,76,and i laugh
3608,76,not out loud
3609,76,"but all up and down these walls, these"
3610,76,dirty yellow and blue walls
3611,76,my white cat asleep on the
3612,76,table
3613,76,hiding his eyes from the
3614,76,"light,"
3615,76,
3616,76,he's not alone tonight
3617,76,and neither am
3618,76,"i,"
3619,77,out of the arm of one love
3620,77,and into the arms of another
3621,77,i have been saved from dying on the cross
3622,77,by a lady who smokes pot
3623,77,writes songs and stories
3624,77,"and is much kinder than the last,"
3625,77,"much much kinder,"
3626,77,"and the sex is just as good or better,"
3627,77,"it isn't pleasant to be put on the cross and left there,"
3628,77,it is much more pleasant to forget a love which didn't
3629,77,work
3630,77,as all love
3631,77,finally
3632,77,"doesn't work ,"
3633,77,it is much more pleasant to make love
3634,77,along the shore in del mar
3635,77,"in room 42, and afterwards"
3636,77,sitting up in bed
3637,77,"drinking good wine, talking and touching"
3638,77,smoking
3639,77,"listening to the waves ,"
3640,77,
3641,77,i have died too many times
3642,77,"believing and waiting, waiting"
3643,77,in a room
3644,77,staring at a cracked ceiling
3645,77,"waiting for the phone, a letter, a knock, a sound ,"
3646,77,going wild inside
3647,77,"while she danced with strangers in nightclubs ,"
3648,77,out of the arms of one love
3649,77,and into the arms of another
3650,77,"it's not pleasant to die on the cross,"
3651,77,it is much more pleasant to hear your name whispered in
3652,77,"the dark,"
3653,78,never
3654,78,even in calmer times
3655,78,have i ever
3656,78,dreamed of

3936,87,handicapping tomorrow's
3937,87,"card,"
3938,87,when am i going to get at the poems?
3939,87,"well, they'll just have to wait"
3940,87,they'll have to warm their feet in the
3941,87,anteroom
3942,87,where they'll sit gossiping about
3943,87,"me,"
3944,87,"this chinaski, doesn't he realize that"
3945,87,without us he would have long ago
3946,87,"gone mad, been dead?"
3947,87,"he knows, but he thinks he can keep"
3948,87,us at his beck and call!

3960,87,somewhere where i am

3984,89,when you're young
3985,89,a pair of
3986,89,female
3987,89,high-heeled shoes
3988,89,just sitting
3989,89,alone
3990,89,in the closet
3991,89,can fire your
3992,89,bones;
3993,89,when you're old
3994,89,it's just
3995,89,a pair of shoes
3996,89,without
3997,89,anybody
3998,89,in them
3999,89,and
4000,89,just as
4001,89,"well,"
4002,90,"i took my girlfriend to your last poetry reading,"
4003,90,"she said,"
4004,90,"yes, yes? i asked,"
4005,90,"she's young and pretty, she said,"
4006,90,"and? i asked,"
4007,90,she hated your
4008,90,"guts,"
4009,90,then she stretched out on the couch
4010,90,and pulled off her
4011,90,"boots,"
4012,90,"i don't have very good legs,"
4013,90,"she said,"
4014,90,"all right, i thought, i don't have very good"
4015,90,poetry; she doesn't have very good
4016,90,"legs,"
4017,90,"scramble two,"
4018,91,i can't have it
4019,91,and you can't have it
4020,91,and we won't
4021,91,get it
4022,91,
4023,91,so don't bet on it
4024,91,or even think about
4025,91,it
4026,91,
4027,91,just get out of bed
4028,91,each morning
4029,91,
4030,91,wash
4031,91,shave
4032,91,clothe
4033,91,yourself
4034,91,and go out into
4035,91,it
4036,91,
4037,91,because
4038,91,outside of that
4039,91,all that's left is
4040,91,suicide and
4041,91,madness
4042,91,
4043,91,so you just
4044,91,can't
4045,91,expect too much
4046,91,
4047,91,you can't even
4048,91,expect
4049,91,
4050,91,so what you do
4051,91,is
4052,91,work from a modest
4053,91,minimal
4054,91,base
4055,91,
4056,91,like when you
4057,91,walk outside
4058,91,be glad your car
4059,91,might possibly
4060,91,be there
4061,91,
4062,91,and if it is-
4063,91,that the tires
4064,91,aren't
4065,91,flat
4066,91,
4067,91,then you get
4068,91,in
4069,91,and if it
4070,91,starts--you
4071,91,"start,"
4072,91,
4073,91,and
4074,91,it's the damndest
4075,91,movie
4076,91,you've ever
4077,91,seen
4078,91,because
4079,91,you're
4080,91,in it--
4081,91,
4082,91,low budget
4083,91,and
4084,91,4 billion
4085,91,critics
4086,91,
4087,91,and the longest
4088,91,run
4089,91,you ever hope
4090,91,for
4091,91,is
4092,91,
4093,91,one
4094,91,"day,"
4095,92,she was a short one
4096,92,getting fat and she had once been
4097,92,beautiful and
4098,92,she drank the wine
4099,92,she drank the wine in bed and
4100,92,talked and screamed and cursed at
4101,92,me
4102,92,and i told her
4103,92,"please, i need some"
4104,92,"sleep,"
4105,92,-sleep? sleep? ya son of a
4106,92,"bitch, ya never sleep, ya"
4107,92,don't need any
4108,92,sleep!
4109,92,i buried her one morning early
4110,92,i carried her down the sides of the hollywood hills
4111,92,brambles and rabbits and rocks
4112,92,running in front of me
4113,92,and by the time i'd dug the ditch
4114,92,and stuck her in
4115,92,belly down
4116,92,and put the dirt back on
4117,92,the sun was up and it was warm
4118,92,and the flies were lazy and
4119,92,i could hardly see anything out of my eyes
4120,92,everything was so
4121,92,"warm and yellow,"
4122,92,i managed to drive home and i got into bed and i
4123,92,slept for 5 days and 4
4124,92,"nights,"
4125,92,from poems written before jumping out of an 8 story window - 1966
4126,93,"he said, i was working in hollywood when faulkner was"
4127,93,working in hollywood and he was
4128,93,"the worst, he was too drunk to stand up at the"
4129,93,end of the afternoon and so i had to help him
4130,93,into a taxi
4131,93,"day after day after day,"
4132,93,
4133,93,"but when he left hollywood, i stayed on, and while i"
4134,93,"didn't drink like that maybe i should have, i might have"
4135,93,had the guts then to follow him and get the hell out of
4136,93,"there,"
4137,93,
4138,93,"i told him, you write as well as"
4139,93,"faulkner,,"
4140,93,
4141,93,you mean that? he asked from the hospital
4142,93,"bed, smiling,"
4143,94,"the words have come and gone,"
4144,94,"i sit ill,"
4145,94,"the phone rings, the cats sleep,"
4146,94,"linda vacuums,"
4147,94,"i am waiting to live,"
4148,94,"waiting to die,"
4149,94,"i wish i could ring in some bravery,"
4150,94,it's a lousy fix
4151,94,"but the tree outside doesn't know,"
4152,94,i watch it moving with the wind
4153,94,"in the late afternoon sun,"
4154,94,"there's nothing to declare here,"
4155,94,"just a waiting,"
4156,94,"each faces it alone,"
4157,94,"oh, i was once young,"
4158,94,"oh, i was once unbelievably"
4159,94,young!
4160,94,"from transit magazine, 1994"
4161,95,"some people never go crazy,"
4162,95,"me, sometimes i'll lie down behind the couch"
4163,95,"for 3 or 4 days,"
4164,95,"they'll find me there,"
4165,95,"it's cherub, they'll say, and"
4166,95,they pour wine down my throat
4167,95,rub my chest
4168,95,"sprinkle me with oils,"
4169,95,"then, i'll rise with a roar,"
4170,95,"rant, rage -"
4171,95,curse them and the universe
4172,95,as i send them scattering over the
4173,95,"lawn,"
4174,95,"i'll feel much better,"
4175,95,"sit down to toast and eggs,"
4176,95,"hum a little tune,"
4177,95,suddenly become as lovable as a
4178,95,pink
4179,95,"overfed whale,"
4180,95,"some people never go crazy,"
4181,95,what truly horrible lives
4182,95,"they must lead,"
4183,96,"god i got the sad blue blues,"
4184,96,this woman sat there and she
4185,96,said
4186,96,are you really charles
4187,96,
4188,96,       bukowski?
4189,96,
4190,96,and i said
4191,96,
4192,96,   forget that
4193,96,
4194,96,i do not feel good
4195,96,i've got the sad sads
4196,96,all i want to do is
4197,96,fuck you
4198,96,and she laughed
4199,96,she thought i was being
4200,96,clever
4201,96,and o i just looked up her long slim legs of heaven
4202,96,i saw her liver and her quivering intestine
4203,96,i saw christ in there
4204,96,jumping to a folk-rock
4205,96,all the long lines of starvation within me
4206,96,rose
4207,96,and i walked over
4208,96,and grabbed her on the couch
4209,96,ripped her dress up around her face
4210,96,and i didn't care
4211,96,rape or the end of the earth
4212,96,one more time
4213,96,to be there
4214,96,anywhere
4215,96,real
4216,96,yes
4217,96,her panties were on the
4218,96,floor
4219,96,and my cock went in
4220,96,my cock my god my cock went in
4221,96,i was charles
4222,96,"somebody,"
4223,97,we have everything and we have nothing
4224,97,and some men do it in churches
4225,97,and some men do it by tearing butterflies
4226,97,in half
4227,97,and some men do it in palm springs
4228,97,laying it into butterblondes
4229,97,with cadillac souls
4230,97,cadillacs and butterflies
4231,97,"nothing and everything,"
4232,97,the face melting down to the last puff
4233,97,"in a cellar in corpus christi,"
4234,97,"there's something for the touts, the nuns,"
4235,97,"the grocery clerks and you , , ,"
4236,97,"something at 8 a,m,, something in the library"
4237,97,"something in the river,"
4238,97,"everything and nothing,"
4239,97,in the slaughterhouse it comes running along
4240,97,"the ceiling on a hook, and you swing it --"
4241,97,one
4242,97,two
4243,97,three
4244,97,"and then you've got it, $200 worth of dead"
4245,97,"meat, its bones against your bones"
4246,97,"something and nothing,"
4247,97,it's always early enough to die and
4248,97,"it's always too late,"
4249,97,and the drill of blood in the basin white
4250,97,it tells you nothing at all
4251,97,and the gravediggers playing poker over
4252,97,"5 a,m, coffee, waiting for the grass"
4253,97,"to dismiss the frost , , ,"
4254,97,"they tell you nothing at all,"
4255,97,
4256,97,we have everything and we have nothing --
4257,97,days with glass edges and the impossible stink
4258,97,of river moss -- worse than shit;
4259,97,"checkerboard days of moves and countermoves,"
4260,97,"fagged interest, with as much sense in defeat as"
4261,97,in victory; slow days like mules
4262,97,humping it slagged and sullen and sun-glazed
4263,97,up a road where a madman sits waiting among
4264,97,bluejays and wrens netted in and sucked a flaky
4265,97,"grey,"
4266,97,"good days too of wine and shouting, fights"
4267,97,"in alleys, fat legs of women striving around"
4268,97,"your bowels buried in moans,"
4269,97,the signs in bullrings like diamonds hollering
4270,97,"mother capri, violets coming out of the ground"
4271,97,telling you to forget the dead armies and the loves
4272,97,"that robbed you,"
4273,97,days when children say funny and brilliant things
4274,97,like savages trying to send you a message through
4275,97,their bodies while their bodies are still
4276,97,alive enough to transmit and feel and run up
4277,97,and down without locks and paychecks and
4278,97,ideals and possessions and beetle-like
4279,97,"opinions,"
4280,97,days when you can cry all day long in
4281,97,"a green room with the door locked, days"
4282,97,when you can laugh at the breadman
4283,97,"because his legs are too long, days"
4284,97,"of looking at hedges , , ,"
4285,97,
4286,97,"and nothing, and nothing, the days of"
4287,97,"the bosses, yellow men"
4288,97,"with bad breath and big feet, men"
4289,97,"who look like frogs, hyenas, men who walk"
4290,97,"as if melody had never been invented, men"
4291,97,who think it is intelligent to hire and fire and
4292,97,"profit, men with expensive wives they possess"
4293,97,like 60 acres of ground to be drilled
4294,97,or shown-off or to be walled away from
4295,97,"the incompetent, men who'd kill you"
4296,97,because they're crazy and justify it because
4297,97,"it's the law, men who stand in front of"
4298,97,"windows 30 feet wide and see nothing,"
4299,97,men with luxury yachts who can sail around
4300,97,the world and yet never get out of their vest
4301,97,"pockets, men like snails, men like eels, men"
4302,97,"like slugs, and not as good , , ,"
4303,97,"and nothing, getting your last paycheck"
4304,97,"at a harbor, at a factory, at a hospital, at an"
4305,97,"aircraft plant, at a penny arcade, at a"
4306,97,"barbershop, at a job you didn't want"
4307,97,"anyway,"
4308,97,"income tax, sickness, servility, broken"
4309,97,"arms, broken heads -- all the stuffing"
4310,97,"come out like an old pillow,"
4311,97,
4312,97,"we have everything and we have nothing,"
4313,97,some do it well enough for a while and
4314,97,"then give way, fame gets them or disgust"
4315,97,or age or lack of proper diet or ink
4316,97,across the eyes or children in college
4317,97,or new cars or broken backs while skiing
4318,97,in switzerland or new politics or new wives
4319,97,or just natural change and decay --
4320,97,the man you knew yesterday hooking
4321,97,for ten rounds or drinking for three days and
4322,97,three nights by the sawtooth mountains now
4323,97,just something under a sheet or a cross
4324,97,"or a stone or under an easy delusion,"
4325,97,or packing a bible or a golf bag or a
4326,97,"briefcase, how they go, how they go! -- all"
4327,97,"the ones you thought would never go,"
4328,97,
4329,97,"days like this, like your day today,"
4330,97,maybe the rain on the window trying to
4331,97,"get through to you, what do you see today?"
4332,97,what is it? where are you? the best
4333,97,"days are sometimes the first, sometimes"
4334,97,"the middle and even sometimes the last,"
4335,97,"the vacant lots are not bad, churches in"
4336,97,"europe on postcards are not bad, people in"
4337,97,wax museums frozen into their best sterility
4338,97,"are not bad, horrible but not bad, the"
4339,97,"cannon, think of the cannon, and toast for"
4340,97,breakfast the coffee hot enough you
4341,97,"know your tongue is still there, three"
4342,97,"geraniums outside a window, trying to be"
4343,97,red and trying to be pink and trying to be
4344,97,"geraniums, no wonder sometimes the women"
4345,97,"cry, no wonder the mules don't want"
4346,97,"to go up the hill, are you in a hotel room"
4347,97,in detroit looking for a cigarette? one more
4348,97,"good day, a little bit of it, and as"
4349,97,the nurses come out of the building after
4350,97,"their shift, having had enough, eight nurses"
4351,97,with different names and different places
4352,97,"to go -- walking across the lawn, some of them"
4353,97,"want cocoa and a paper, some of them want a"
4354,97,"hot bath, some of them want a man, some"
4355,97,"of them are hardly thinking at all, enough"
4356,97,"and not enough, arcs and pilgrims, oranges"
4357,97,"gutters, ferns, antibodies, boxes of"
4358,97,"tissue paper,"
4359,97,
4360,97,in the most decent sometimes sun
4361,97,there is the softsmoke feeling from urns

4376,98,the illusion is that you are simply
4377,98,"reading this poem,"
4378,98,the reality is that this is

4381,98,"this is a beggar's knife,"
4382,98,"this is a tulip,"
4383,98,this is a soldier marching

4391,98,"this is a horse asleep,"
4392,98,a butterfly in
4393,98,"your brain,"

4395,98,"circus,"
4396,98,you are not reading this
4397,98,"on a page,"
4398,98,the page is reading
4399,98,"you,"
4400,98,feel it?
4401,98,"it's like a cobra, it's a hungry eagle circling the room,"
4402,98,
4403,98,"this is not a poem, poems are dull,"
4404,98,"they make you sleep,"

4425,98,"great,"
4426,98,"victorious,"

4436,99,frogs trying to figure
4437,99,the sky;
4438,99,"sway with me, sad things --"
4439,99,fingers split on a forge
4440,99,old age like breakfast shell

4448,99,dead or lost
4449,99,"or unforgiving,"
4450,100,you may not believe it
4451,100,but there are people
4452,100,who go through life with
4453,100,very little
4454,100,friction or
4455,100,"distress,"
4456,100,"they dress well, eat"
4457,100,"well, sleep well,"
4458,100,they are contented with
4459,100,their family
4460,100,"life,"
4461,100,they have moments of
4462,100,grief
4463,100,but all in all
4464,100,they are undisturbed
4465,100,and often feel
4466,100,"very good,"
4467,100,and when they die
4468,100,it is an easy
4469,100,"death, usually in their"
4470,100,"sleep,"
4471,100,you may not believe
4472,100,it
4473,100,but such people do

4484,100,there

4486,100,"here,"
4487,101,lonely as a dry and used orchard
4488,101,spread over the earth
4489,101,"for use and surrender,"
4490,101,
4491,101,shot down like an ex-pug selling

4541,101,cemeteries

4659,103,
4660,103,and the best at murder are those who preach against it
4661,103,and the best at hate are those who preach love

4671,103,beware those who either detest poverty
4672,103,or are proud of it
4673,103,beware those quick to praise
4674,103,for they need praise in return
4675,103,beware those who are quick to censor
4676,103,they are afraid of what they do not know

4684,103,there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you
4685,103,to kill anybody
4686,103,not wanting solitude
4687,103,not understanding solitude
4688,103,they will attempt to destroy anything
4689,103,that differs from their own
4690,103,not being able to create art
4691,103,they will not understand art
4692,103,they will consider their failure as creators
4693,103,only as a failure of the world
4694,103,not being able to love fully
4695,103,they will believe your love incomplete
4696,103,and then they will hate you
4697,103,and their hatred will be perfect
4698,103,
4699,103,like a shining diamond

4706,104,the german hotel was very strange and expensive and had
4707,104,"double doors to the rooms, very thick doors, and it over-"
4708,104,looked the park and the vasser tern and in the mornings
4709,104,it was usually too late for breakfast and the maids
4710,104,would be everywhere changing sheets and bringing in
4711,104,"towels, but you never saw any hotel guests, only the"
4712,104,maids and the desk man and the day desk man was all
4713,104,right because we were sober during the day but we had
4714,104,trouble with the night man who was some sort of snob
4715,104,and not very good with getting the corkscrews and ice
4716,104,and wine glasses up to us and he was always phoning to
4717,104,"say the other guests objected to our noise,"
4718,104,what other guests?
4719,104,"i always told him that everything was very quiet,"
4720,104,"nothing was going on, that somebody must be crazy, so"
4721,104,will you please stop ringing?
4722,104,"but he kept ringing, he became almost like a"
4723,104,"companion to us through the night,"
4724,104,"but the day man was very nice, he always had little"
4725,104,"messages of importance that either meant money, or a"
4726,104,"good friend coming to see us, or both,"
4727,104,we stayed at the hotel twice during our trip to
4728,104,europe and each time we checked out the day clerk
4729,104,"bowed ever so slightly, he was tall and well-dressed"
4730,104,"and pleasant and he said each time, it was nice to"
4731,104,"have you with us, please come here again if you return,"
4732,104,
4733,104,"thank you, we said, thank you,"
4734,104,
4735,104,it's our favorite hotel and if i ever get rich i am
4736,104,going to buy it and fire the night clerk and there will
4737,104,"be enough ice cubes and corkscrews for everybody,"
4738,105,i was always a natural slob
4739,105,i liked to lay upon the bed
4740,105,"in undershirt stained, of"
4741,105,course and with cigarette
4742,105,holes
4743,105,shoes off
4744,105,beer bottle in hand
4745,105,trying to shake off a
4746,105,"difficult night, say with a"
4747,105,woman still around
4748,105,walking the floor
4749,105,complaining about this and
4750,105,"that,"
4751,105,and i'd work up a
4752,105,"belch and say, hey, you don't"
4753,105,like it? then get your ass
4754,105,out of here!
4755,105,
4756,105,"i really loved myself, i"
4757,105,really loved my slob-
4758,105,"self, and"
4759,105,"they seemed to also,"
4760,105,always leaving
4761,105,but almost
4762,105,always
4763,105,coming
4764,105,"back,"
4765,106,he came to the door one night wet thin beaten and
4766,106,terrorized
4767,106,a white cross-eyed tailless cat
4768,106,i took him in and fed him and he stayed
4769,106,grew to trust me until a friend drove up the driveway
4770,106,and ran him over
4771,106,"i took what was left to a vet who said,not much"
4772,106,"chance,give him these pills,his backbone"
4773,106,"is crushed, but is was crushed before and somehow"
4774,106,"mended, if he lives he'll never walk, look at"
4775,106,"these x-rays, he's been shot, look here, the pellets"
4776,106,"are still there,also, he once had a tail, somebody"
4777,106,"cut it off,"
4778,106,"i took the cat back, it was a hot summer, one of the"
4779,106,"hottest in decades, i put him on the bathroom"
4780,106,"floor, gave him water and pills, he wouldn't eat, he"
4781,106,"wouldn't touch the water, i dipped my finger into it"
4782,106,"and wet his mouth and i talked to him, i didn't go any-"
4783,106,"where, i put in a lot of bathroom time and talked to"
4784,106,him and gently touched him and he looked back at
4785,106,me with those pale blue crossed eyes and as the days went
4786,106,by he made his first move
4787,106,dragging himself forward by his front legs
4788,106,the rear ones wouldn't work
4789,106,he made it to the litter box
4790,106,"crawled over and in,"
4791,106,it was like the trumpet of possible victory
4792,106,"blowing in that bathroom and into the city, i"
4793,106,"related to that cat-i'd had it bad, not that"
4794,106,bad but bad enough
4795,106,"one morning he got up, stood up, fell back down and"
4796,106,"just looked at me,"
4797,106,"you can make it, i said to him,"
4798,106,"he kept trying, getting up falling down, finally"
4799,106,"he walked a few steps, he was like a drunk, the"
4800,106,"rear legs just didn't want to do it and he fell again, rested,"
4801,106,"then got up,"
4802,106,"you know the rest, now he's better than ever, cross-eyed"
4803,106,"almost toothless, but the grace is back, and that look in"
4804,106,"his eyes never left,"
4805,106,"and now sometimes i'm interviewed, they want to hear about"
4806,106,"life and literature and i get drunk and hold up my cross-eyed,"
4807,106,"shot, runover de-tailed cat and i say,look, look"
4808,106,at this!
4809,106,"but they don't understand, they say something like,you"
4810,106,say you've been influenced by celine?
4811,106,"no, i hold the cat up,by what happens, by"
4812,106,"things like this, by this, by this!"
4813,106,"i shake the cat, hold him up in"
4814,106,"the smoky and drunken light, he's relaxed he knows,"
4815,106,it's then that the interviews end
4816,106,although i am proud sometimes when i see the pictures
4817,106,later and there i am and there is the cat and we are photo-
4818,106,"graphed together,"
4819,106,"he too knows it's bullshit but that somehow it all helps,"
4820,107,they are building a house
4821,107,half a block down
4822,107,and i sit up here
4823,107,with the shades down
4824,107,"listening to the sounds,"
4825,107,"the hammers pounding in nails,"
4826,107,"thack thack thack thack,"
4827,107,"and then i hear birds,"
4828,107,"and thack thack thack,"
4829,107,"and i go to bed,"
4830,107,i pull the covers to my throat;
4831,107,they have been building this house
4832,107,"for a month, and soon it will have"
4833,107,"its people,sleeping, eating,"
4834,107,"loving, moving around,"
4835,107,but somehow
4836,107,now
4837,107,"it is not right,"
4838,107,"there seems a madness,"
4839,107,men walk on top with nails
4840,107,in their mouths
4841,107,"and i read about castro and cuba,"
4842,107,and at night i walk by
4843,107,and the ribs of the house show
4844,107,and inside i can see cats walking
4845,107,"the way cats walk,"
4846,107,and then a boy rides by on a bicycle
4847,107,and still the house is not done
4848,107,and in the morning the men
4849,107,will be back
4850,107,walking around on the house
4851,107,"with their hammers,"
4852,107,and it seems people should not build houses
4853,107,"anymore,"
4854,107,it seems people should not get married
4855,107,"anymore,"
4856,107,it seems people should stop working
4857,107,and sit in small rooms
4858,107,on 2nd floors
4859,107,under electric lights without shades;
4860,107,it seems there is a lot to forget
4861,107,"and a lot not to do,"
4862,107,"and in drugstores, markets, bars,"
4863,107,"the people are tired, they do not want"
4864,107,"to move, and i stand there at night"
4865,107,and look through this house and the
4866,107,house does not want to be built;
4867,107,through its sides i can see the purple hills
4868,107,"and the first lights of evening,"
4869,107,and it is cold
4870,107,and i button my coat
4871,107,and i stand there looking through the house
4872,107,and the cats stop and look at me
4873,107,until i am embarrassed
4874,107,and move north up the sidewalk
4875,107,where i will buy
4876,107,cigarettes and beer
4877,107,"and return to my room,"
4878,107,from all's normal here - 1985
4879,108,the lady has me temporarily off the bottle
4880,108,and now the pecker stands up
4881,108,"better,"
4882,108,"however, things change overnight--"
4883,108,instead of listening to shostakovich and
4884,108,mozart through a smeared haze of smoke
4885,108,"the nights change, new"
4886,108,"complexities,"
4887,108,"we drive to baskin-robbins,"
4888,108,"31 flavors,"
4889,108,"rocky road, bubble gum, apricot ice, strawberry"
4890,108,"cheesecake, chocolate mint,"
4891,108,
4892,108,we park outside and look at icecream
4893,108,people
4894,108,"a very healthy and satisfied people,"
4895,108,nary a potential suicide in sight
4896,108,they probably even vote
4897,108,and i tell her
4898,108,what if the boys saw me go in there? suppose they
4899,108,find out i'm going in for a walnut peach sundae?
4900,108,"come on, chicken, she laughs and we go in"
4901,108,"and stand with the icecream people,"
4902,108,none of them are cursing or threatening
4903,108,"the clerks,"
4904,108,there seem to be no hangovers or
4905,108,"grievances,"
4906,108,i am alarmed at the placid and calm wave
4907,108,"that flows about, i feel like a leper in a"
4908,108,"beauty contest, we finally get our sundaes and"
4909,108,"sit in the car and eat them,"
4910,108,
4911,108,"i must admit they are quite good, a curious new"
4912,108,"world, all my friends tell me i am looking"
4913,108,"better, you're looking good, man, we thought you"
4914,108,"were going to die there for a while,"
4915,108,"--those 4,500 dark nights, the jails, the"
4916,108,"hospitals,"
4917,108,
4918,108,and later that night
4919,108,"there is use for the pecker, use for"
4920,108,"love, and it is glorious,"
4921,108,"long and true,"
4922,108,and afterwards we speak of easy things;
4923,108,our heads by the open window with the moonlight
4924,108,"looking through, we sleep in each other's"
4925,108,"arms,"
4926,108,
4927,108,"the icecream people make me feel good,"
4928,108,"inside and out,"
4929,109,"stuck in the rain on the freeway, 6,15 p,m,,"
4930,109,"these are the lucky ones, these are the"
4931,109,"dutifully employed, most with their radios on as loud"
4932,109,"as possible as they try not to think or remember,"
4933,109,
4934,109,"this is our new civilization, as men"
4935,109,once lived in trees and caves now they live
4936,109,in their automobiles and on freeways as
4937,109,
4938,109,the local news is heard again and again while
4939,109,"we shift from first gear to second and back to first,"
4940,109,
4941,109,"there's a poor fellow stalled in the fast lane ahead, hood"
4942,109,"up, he's standing against the freeway fence"
4943,109,"a newspaper over his head in the rain,"
4944,109,
4945,109,"the other cars force their way around his car, pull out into"
4946,109,"the next lane in front of cars determined to shut them off,"
4947,109,
4948,109,in the lane to my right a driver is being followed by a
4949,109,police car with blinking red and blue lights - he surely
4950,109,can't be speeding as
4951,109,
4952,109,suddenly the rain comes down in a giant wash and all the
4953,109,cars stop and
4954,109,
4955,109,even with the windows up i can smell somebody's clutch
4956,109,"burning,"
4957,109,
4958,109,i just hope it's not mine as
4959,109,
4960,109,the wall of water diminishes and we go back into first
4961,109,gear; we are all still
4962,109,a long way from home as i memorize
4963,109,the silhouette of the car in front of me and the shape of the
4964,109,
4965,109,driver's head or
4966,109,what
4967,109,i can see of it above the headrest while
4968,109,his bumper sticker asks me
4969,109,have you hugged your kid today?
4970,109,
4971,109,suddenly i have an urge to scream
4972,109,as another wall of water comes down and the
4973,109,man on the radio announces that there will be a 70 percent
4974,109,chance of showers tomorrow night
4975,110,if i suffer at this
4976,110,typewriter
4977,110,think how i'd feel
4978,110,among the lettuce-
4979,110,pickers of salinas?
4980,110,i think of the men
4981,110,i've known in
4982,110,factories
4983,110,with no way to
4984,110,get out-
4985,110,choking while living
4986,110,choking while laughing
4987,110,at bob hope or lucille
4988,110,ball while
4989,110,2 or 3 children beat
4990,110,tennis balls against
4991,110,"the wall,"
4992,110,some suicides are never
4993,110,"recorded,"
4994,111,here comes the fishhead singing
4995,111,here comes the baked potato in drag
4996,111,here comes nothing to do all day long
4997,111,here comes another night of no sleep
4998,111,here comes the phone wringing the wrong tone
4999,111,here comes a termite with a banjo
5000,111,here comes a flagpole with blank eyes
5001,111,here comes a a cat and a dog wearing nylons
5002,111,here comes a machine gun saying
5003,111,here comes bacon burning in the pan
5004,111,here comes a voice saying something dull
5005,111,here comes a newspaper stuffed with small red birds
5006,111,with flat brown beaks
5007,111,here comes a cunt carrying a torch
5008,111,a grenade
5009,111,a deathly love
5010,111,here comes a victory carrying
5011,111,one bucket of blood
5012,111,and stumbling over the berry bush
5013,111,and the sheets hang out the windows
5014,111,and the bombers head east west north south
5015,111,get lost
5016,111,get tossed like salad
5017,111,as all the fish in the sea line up and form
5018,111,one line
5019,111,one long line
5020,111,one very long thin line
5021,111,the longest line you could ever imagine
5022,111,and we get lost
5023,111,walking past purple mountains
5024,111,we walk lost
5025,111,bare at last like the knife
5026,111,having given
5027,111,having spit it out like an unexpected olive seed
5028,111,as the girl at the call service
5029,111,"screams over the phone,"
5030,111,don't call back! you sound like a jerk!
5031,112,"cass was the youngest and most beautiful of 5 sisters, cass was the most beautiful girl"
5032,112,"in town, 1/2 indian with a supple and strange body, a snake-like and fiery body with eyes"
5033,112,"to go with it, cass was fluid moving fire, she was like a spirit stuck into a form that"
5034,112,"would not hold her, her hair was black and long and silken and whirled about as did her"
5035,112,"body, her spirit was either very high or very low, there was no in between for cass, some"
5036,112,"said she was crazy, the dull ones said that, the dull ones would never understand cass, to"
5037,112,"the men she was simply a sex machine and they didn't care whether she was crazy or not,"
5038,112,"and cass danced and flirted, kissed the men, but except for an instance or two, when it"
5039,112,"came time to make it with cass, cass had somehow slipped away, eluded the men,"
5040,112,"her sisters accused her of misusing her beauty, of not using her mind enough, but cass"
5041,112,"had mind and spirit; she painted, she danced, she sang, she made things of clay, and when"
5042,112,"people were hurt either in the spirit or the flesh, cass felt a deep grieving for them,"
5043,112,"her mind was simply different; her mind was simply not practical, her sisters were jealous"
5044,112,"of her because she attracted their men, and they were angry because they felt she didn't"
5045,112,"make the best use of them, she had a habit of being kind to the uglier ones; the so-called"
5046,112,"handsome men revolted her- no guts, she said, no zap, they are riding on"
5047,112,"their perfect little earlobes and well- shaped nostrils,all surface and no"
5048,112,"insides, she had a temper that came close to insanity, she had a temper that some"
5049,112,"call insanity, her father had died of alcohol and her mother had run off leaving the"
5050,112,"girls alone, the girls went to a relative who placed them in a convent, the convent had"
5051,112,"been an unhappy place, more for cass than the sisters, the girls were jealous of cass and"
5052,112,"cass fought most of them, she had razor marks all along her left arm from defending"
5053,112,"herself in two fights, there was also a permanent scar along the left cheek but the scar"
5054,112,"rather than lessening her beauty only seemed to highlight it, i met her at the west end"
5055,112,"bar several nights after her release from the convent, being youngest, she was the last of"
5056,112,"the sisters to be released, she simply came in and sat next to me, i was probably the"
5057,112,"ugliest man in town and this might have had something to do with it,"
5058,112,"drink? i asked,"
5059,112,"sure, why not?"
5060,112,"i don't suppose there was anything unusual in our conversation that night, it was"
5061,112,"simply in the feeling cass gave, she had chosen me and it was as simple as that, no"
5062,112,"pressure, she liked her drinks and had a great number of them, she didn't seem quite of"
5063,112,"age but they served he anyhow, perhaps she had forged i,d,, i don't know, anyhow, each"
5064,112,"time she came back from the restroom and sat down next to me, i did feel some pride, she"
5065,112,was not only the most beautiful woman in town but also one of the most beautiful i had
5066,112,"ever seen, i placed my arm about her waist and kissed her once,"
5067,112,"do you think i'm pretty? she asked,"
5068,112,"yes, of course, but there's something else, there's more than your"
5069,112,"looks,"
5070,112,"people are always accusing me of being pretty, do you really think i'm"
5071,112,pretty?
5072,112,"pretty isn't the word, it hardly does you fair,"
5073,112,"cass reached into her handbag, i thought she was reaching for her handkerchief, she"
5074,112,"came out with a long hatpin, before i could stop her she had run this long hatpin through"
5075,112,"her nose, sideways, just above the nostrils, i felt disgust and horror, she looked at me"
5076,112,"and laughed, now do you think me pretty? what do you think now, man? i pulled"
5077,112,"the hatpin out and held my handkerchief over the bleeding, several people, including the"
5078,112,"bartender, had seen the act, the bartender came down,"
5079,112,"look, he said to cass, you act up again and you're out, we don't need"
5080,112,"your dramatics here,"
5081,112,"oh, fuck you, man! she said,"
5082,112,"better keep her straight, the bartender said to me,"
5083,112,"she'll be all right, i said,"
5084,112,"it's my nose, i can do what i want with my nose,"
5085,112,"no, i said, it hurts me,"
5086,112,you mean it hurts you when i stick a pin in my nose?
5087,112,"yes, it does, i mean it,"
5088,112,"all right, i won't do it again, cheer up,"
5089,112,"she kissed me, rather grinning through the kiss and holding the handkerchief to her"
5090,112,"nose, we left for my place at closing time, i had some beer and we sat there talking, it"
5091,112,"was then that i got the perception of her as a person full of kindness and caring, she"
5092,112,"gave herself away without knowing it, at the same time she would leap back into areas of"
5093,112,"wildness and incoherence, schitzi, a beautiful and spiritual schitzi, perhaps some man,"
5094,112,"something, would ruin her forever, i hoped that it wouldn't be me, we went to bed and"
5095,112,"after i turned out the lights cass asked me,"
5096,112,when do you want it? now or in the morning?
5097,112,"in the morning, i said and turned my back,"
5098,112,"in the morning i got up and made a couple of coffees, brought her one in bed, she"
5099,112,"laughed,"
5100,112,"you're the first man who has turned it down at night,"
5101,112,"it's o,k,, i said, we needn't do it at all,"
5102,112,"no, wait, i want to now, let me freshen up a bit,"
5103,112,"cass went into the bathroom, she came out shortly, looking quite wonderful, her long"
5104,112,"black hair glistening, her eyes and lips glistening, her glistening, she displayed her"
5105,112,"body calmly, as a good thing, she got under the sheet,"
5106,112,"come on, lover man,"
5107,112,"i got in, she kissed with abandon but without haste, i let my hands run over her body,"
5108,112,"through her hair, i mounted, it was hot, and tight, i began to stroke slowly, wanting to"
5109,112,"make it last, her eyes looked directly into mine,"
5110,112,"what's your name? i asked,"
5111,112,"what the hell difference does it make? she asked,"
5112,112,"i laughed and went on ahead, afterwards she dressed and i drove her back to the bar but"
5113,112,"she was difficult to forget, i wasn't working and i slept until 2 p,m, then got up and"
5114,112,"read the paper, i was in the bathtub when she came in with a large leaf- an elephant ear,"
5115,112,"i knew you'd be in the bathtub, she said, so i brought you something"
5116,112,"to cover that thing with, nature boy,"
5117,112,"she threw the elephant leaf down on me in the bathtub,"
5118,112,how did you know i'd be in the tub?
5119,112,"i knew,"
5120,112,"almost every day cass arrived when i was in the tub, the times were different but she"
5121,112,"seldom missed, and there was the elephant leaf, and then we'd make love, one or two nights"
5122,112,"she phoned and i had to bail her out of jail for drunkenness and fighting,"
5123,112,"these sons of bitches, she said, just because they buy you a few"
5124,112,"drinks they think they can get into your pants,"
5125,112,"once you accept a drink you create your own trouble,"
5126,112,"i thought they were interested in me, not just my body,"
5127,112,"i'm interested in you and your body, i doubt, though, that most men can see"
5128,112,"beyond your body,"
5129,112,"i left town for 6 months, bummed around, came back, i had never forgotten cass, but"
5130,112,"we'd had some type of argument and i felt like moving anyhow, and when i got back i"
5131,112,"figured she'd be gone, but i had been sitting in the west end bar about 30 minutes when"
5132,112,"she walked in and sat down next to me,"
5133,112,"well, bastard, i see you've come back,"
5134,112,"i ordered her a drink, then i looked at her, she had on a high- necked dress, i had"
5135,112,"never seen her in one of those, and under each eye, driven in, were 2 pins with glass"
5136,112,"heads, all you could see were the heads of the pins, but the pins were driven down into"
5137,112,"her face,"
5138,112,"god damn you, still trying to destroy your beauty, eh?"
5139,112,"no, it's the fad, you fool,"
5140,112,"you're crazy,"
5141,112,"i've missed you, she said,"
5142,112,is there anybody else?
5143,112,"no there isn't anybody else, just you, but i'm hustling, it costs ten bucks, but"
5144,112,"you get it free,"
5145,112,"pull those pins out,"
5146,112,"no, it's the fad,"
5147,112,"it's making me very unhappy,"
5148,112,are you sure?
5149,112,"hell yes, i'm sure,"
5150,112,"cass slowly pulled the pins out and put them back in her purse,"
5151,112,"why do you haggle your beauty? i asked, why don't you just live with"
5152,112,it?
5153,112,"because people think it's all i have, beauty is nothing, beauty won't stay, you"
5154,112,"don't know how lucky you are to be ugly, because if people like you you know it's for"
5155,112,"something else,"
5156,112,"o,k,, i said, i'm lucky,"
5157,112,"i don't mean you're ugly, people just think you're ugly, you have a fascinating"
5158,112,"face,"
5159,112,"thanks,"
5160,112,"we had another drink,"
5161,112,"what are you doing? she asked,"
5162,112,"nothing, i can't get on to anything, no interest,"
5163,112,"me neither, if you were a woman you could hustle,"
5164,112,"i don't think i could ever make contact with that many strangers, it's"
5165,112,"wearing,"
5166,112,"you're right, it's wearing, everything is wearing,"
5167,112,"we left together, people still stared at cass on the streets, she was a beautiful"
5168,112,"woman, perhaps more beautiful than ever, we made it to my place and i opened a bottle of"
5169,112,"wine and we talked, with cass and i, it always came easy, she talked a while and i would"
5170,112,"listen and then i would talk, our conversation simply went along without strain, we seemed"
5171,112,"to discover secrets together, when we discovered a good one cass would laugh that laugh-"
5172,112,"only the way she could, it was like joy out of fire, through the talking we kissed and"
5173,112,"moved closer together, we became quite heated and decided to go to bed, it was then that"
5174,112,"cass took off her high -necked dress and i saw it- the ugly jagged scar across her throat,"
5175,112,"it was large and thick,"
5176,112,"god damn you, woman, i said from the bed, god damn you, what have you"
5177,112,done?
5178,112,"i tried it with a broken bottle one night, don't you like me any more? am i still"
5179,112,beautiful?
5180,112,"i pulled her down on the bed and kissed her, she pushed away and laughed, some"
5181,112,"men pay me ten and i undress and they don't want to do it, i keep the ten, it's very"
5182,112,"funny,"
5183,112,"yes, i said, i can't stop laughing, cass, bitch, i love you,stop"
5184,112,"destroying yourself; you're the most alive woman i've ever met,"
5185,112,"we kissed again, cass was crying without sound, i could feel the tears, the long black"
5186,112,"hair lay beside me like a flag of death, we enjoined and made slow and somber and"
5187,112,"wonderful love, in the morning cass was up making breakfast, she seemed quite calm and"
5188,112,"happy, she was singing, i stayed in bed and enjoyed her happiness, finally she came over"
5189,112,"and shook me,"
5190,112,"up, bastard! throw some cold water on your face and pecker and come enjoy the"
5191,112,feast!
5192,112,"i drove her to the beach that day, it was a weekday and not yet summer so things were"
5193,112,"splendidly deserted, beach bums in rags slept on the lawns above the sand, others sat on"
5194,112,"stone benches sharing a lone bottle, the gulls whirled about, mindless yet distracted, old"
5195,112,ladies in their 70's and 80's sat on the benches and discussed selling real estate left
5196,112,"behind by husbands long ago killed by the pace and stupidity of survival, for it all,"
5197,112,there was peace in the air and we walked about and stretched on the lawns and didn't say
5198,112,"much, it simply felt good being together, i bought a couple of sandwiches, some chips and"
5199,112,"drinks and we sat on the sand eating, then i held cass and we slept together about an"
5200,112,"hour, it was somehow better than lovemaking, there was flowing together without tension,"
5201,112,"when we awakened we drove back to my place and i cooked a dinner, after dinner i suggested"
5202,112,"to cass that we shack together, she waited a long time, looking at me, then she slowly"
5203,112,"said, no, i drove her back to the bar, bought her a drink and walked out, i"
5204,112,found a job as a parker in a factory the next day and the rest of the week went to
5205,112,"working, i was too tired to get about much but that friday night i did get to the west end"
5206,112,"bar, i sat and waited for cass, hours went by , after i was fairly drunk the bartender"
5207,112,"said to me, i'm sorry about your girlfriend,"
5208,112,"what is it? i asked,"
5209,112,"i'm sorry, didn't you know?"
5210,112,"no,"
5211,112,"suicide, she was buried yesterday,"
5212,112,"buried? i asked, it seemed as though she would walk through the doorway at"
5213,112,"any moment, how could she be gone?"
5214,112,"her sisters buried her,"
5215,112,a suicide? mind telling me how?
5216,112,"she cut her throat,"
5217,112,"i see, give me another drink,"
5218,112,"i drank until closing time, cass was the most beautiful of 5 sisters, the most"
5219,112,"beautiful in town, i managed to drive to my place and i kept thinking, i should have"
5220,112,"insisted she stay with me instead of accepting that no, everything about her"
5221,112,"had indicated that she had cared, i simply had been too offhand about it, lazy, too"
5222,112,"unconcerned, i deserved my death and hers, i was a dog, no, why blame the dogs? i got up"
5223,112,"and found a bottle of wine and drank from it heavily, cass the most beautiful girl in town"
5224,112,"was dead at 20, outside somebody honked their automobile horn, they were very loud and"
5225,112,"persistent, i sat the bottle down and screamed out, god damn you, you son of a bitch"
5226,112,",shut up! the night kept coming and there was nothing i could do,"
5227,113,the night i was going to die
5228,113,i was sweating on the bed
5229,113,and i could hear the crickets
5230,113,and there was a cat fight outside
5231,113,and i could feel my soul dropping down through the
5232,113,mattress
5233,113,and just before it hit the floor i jumped up
5234,113,i was almost too weak to walk
5235,113,but i walked around and turned on all the lights
5236,113,and then i went back to bed
5237,113,and dropped it down again and
5238,113,i was up
5239,113,turning on all the lights
5240,113,i had a 7-year-old daughter
5241,113,and i felt sure she wouldn't want me dead
5242,113,otherwise it wouldn't have
5243,113,mattered
5244,113,but all that night
5245,113,nobody phoned
5246,113,nobody came by with a beer
5247,113,my girlfriend didn't phone
5248,113,all i could hear were the crickets and it was
5249,113,hot
5250,113,and i kept working at it
5251,113,getting up and down
5252,113,until the first of the sun came through the window
5253,113,through the bushes
5254,113,and then i got on the bed
5255,113,and the soul stayed
5256,113,inside at last and
5257,113,"i slept,"
5258,113,now people come by
5259,113,beating on the doors and windows
5260,113,the phone rings
5261,113,the phone rings again and again
5262,113,i get great letters in the mail
5263,113,"hate letters and love letters,"
5264,113,"everything is the same again,"
5265,114,at high noon
5266,114,at a small college near the beach
5267,114,sober
5268,114,the sweat running down my arms
5269,114,a spot of sweat on the table
5270,114,i flatten it with my finger
5271,114,blood money blood money
5272,114,my god they must think i love this like the others
5273,114,but it's for bread and beer and rent
5274,114,blood money
5275,114,i'm tense lousy feel bad
5276,114,poor people i'm failing i'm failing
5277,114,a woman gets up
5278,114,walks out
5279,114,slams the door
5280,114,a dirty poem
5281,114,somebody told me not to read dirty poems
5282,114,here
5283,114,"it's too late,"
5284,114,my eyes can't see some lines
5285,114,i read it
5286,114,out-
5287,114,desperate trembling
5288,114,lousy
5289,114,they can't hear my voice
5290,114,"and i say,"
5291,114,"i quit, that's it, i'm"
5292,114,"finished,"
5293,114,and later in my room
5294,114,"there's scotch and beer,"
5295,114,"the blood of a coward,"
5296,114,this then
5297,114,"will be my destiny,"
5298,114,scrabbling for pennies in tiny dark halls
5299,114,reading poems i have long since become tired
5300,114,"of,"
5301,114,and i used to think
5302,114,that men who drove buses
5303,114,or cleaned out latrines
5304,114,or murdered men in alleys were
5305,114,"fools,"
5306,115,"this time has finished me,"
5307,115,i feel like the german troops
5308,115,whipped by snow and the communists
5309,115,walking bent
5310,115,with newspapers stuffed into
5311,115,"worn boots,"
5312,115,"my plight is just as terrible,"
5313,115,"maybe more so,"
5314,115,victory was so close
5315,115,"victory was there,"
5316,115,as she stood before my mirror
5317,115,younger and more beautiful than
5318,115,any woman i had ever known
5319,115,combing yards and yards of red hair
5320,115,"as i watched her,"
5321,115,and when she came to bed
5322,115,she was more beautiful than ever
5323,115,"and the love was very very good,"
5324,115,"eleven months,"
5325,115,now she's gone
5326,115,"gone as they go,"
5327,115,
5328,115,"this time has finished me,"
5329,115,it's a long road back
5330,115,and back to where?
5331,115,the guy ahead of me
5332,115,"falls,"
5333,115,"i step over him,"
5334,115,did she get him too?
5335,116,we like to shower afterwards
5336,116,i like the water hotter than she
5337,116,and her face is always soft and peaceful
5338,116,and she'll watch me first
5339,116,spread the soap over my balls
5340,116,lift the balls
5341,116,"squeeze them,"
5342,116,"then wash the cock,"
5343,116,"hey, this thing is still hard!"
5344,116,"then get all the hair down there,-"
5345,116,"the belly, the back, the neck, the legs,"
5346,116,"i grin grin grin,"
5347,116,"and then i wash her, , ,"
5348,116,"first the cunt, i"
5349,116,"stand behind her, my cock in the cheeks of her ass"
5350,116,"i gently soap up the cunt hairs,"
5351,116,"wash there with a soothing motion,"
5352,116,"i linger perhaps longer than necessary,"
5353,116,"then i get the backs of the legs, the ass,"
5354,116,"the back, the neck, i turn her, kiss her,"
5355,116,"soap up the breasts, get them and the belly, the neck,"
5356,116,"the fronts of the legs, the ankles, the feet,"
5357,116,"and then the cunt, once more, for luck, , ,"
5358,116,"another kiss, and she gets out first,"
5359,116,"toweling, sometimes singing while i stay in"
5360,116,turn the water on hotter
5361,116,feeling the good times of love's miracle
5362,116,"i then get out, , ,"
5363,116,"it is usually mid-afternoon and quiet,"
5364,116,and getting dressed we talk about what else
5365,116,"there might be to do,"
5366,116,but being together solves most of it
5367,116,for as long as those things stay solved
5368,116,in the history of women and
5369,116,"man, it's different for each-"
5370,116,"for me, it's splendid enough to remember"
5371,116,"past the memories of pain and defeat and unhappiness,"
5372,116,when you take it away
5373,116,do it slowly and easily
5374,116,make it as if i were dying in my sleep instead of in
5375,116,"my life, amen,"
5376,117,and the sun wields mercy
5377,117,"but like a jet torch carried to high,"
5378,117,and the jets whip across its sight
5379,117,"and rockets leap like toads,"
5380,117,and the boys get out the maps
5381,117,"and pin-cushion the moon,"
5382,117,"old green cheese,"
5383,117,"no life there but too much on earth,"
5384,117,our unwashed india boys
5385,117,"crossing their legs,playing pipes,"
5386,117,"starving with sucked in bellies,"
5387,117,watching the snakes volute
5388,117,like beautiful women in the hungry air;
5389,117,"the rockets leap,"
5390,117,"the rockets leap like hares,"
5391,117,clearing clump and dog
5392,117,replacing out-dated bullets;
5393,117,the chinese still carve
5394,117,"in jade,quietly stuffing rice"
5395,117,"into their hunger, a hunger"
5396,117,"a thousand years old,"
5397,117,their muddy rivers moving with fire
5398,117,"and song, barges, houseboats"
5399,117,pushed by drifting poles
5400,117,of waiting without wanting;
5401,117,in turkey they face the east
5402,117,on their carpets
5403,117,praying to a purple god
5404,117,who smokes and laughs
5405,117,and sticks fingers in their eyes
5406,117,"blinding them, as gods will do;"
5407,117,"but the rockets are ready, peace is no longer,"
5408,117,"for some reason,precious;"
5409,117,madness drifts like lily pads
5410,117,on a pond circling senselessly;
5411,117,the painters paint dipping
5412,117,"their reds and greens and yellows,"
5413,117,"poets rhyme their loneliness,"
5414,117,musicians starve as always
5415,117,"and the novelists miss the mark,"
5416,117,"but not the pelican , the gull;"
5417,117,"pelicans dip and dive, rise,"
5418,117,shaking shocked half-dead
5419,117,radioactive fish from their beaks;
5420,117,"indeed, indeed, the waters wash"
5421,117,"the rocks with slime; and on wall st,"
5422,117,the market staggers like a lost drunk
5423,117,"looking for his key; ah,"
5424,117,"this will be a good one,by god,"
5425,117,it will take us back to the
5426,117,"sabre-teeth, the winged monkey"
5427,117,scrabbling in pits over bits
5428,117,"of helmet, instrument and glass;"
5429,117,a lightning crashes across
5430,117,the window and in a million rooms
5431,117,lovers lie entwined and lost
5432,117,and sick as peace;
5433,117,the sky still breaks red and orange for the
5434,117,"painters-and for the lovers,"
5435,117,flowers open as they always have
5436,117,opened but covered with thin dust
5437,117,"of rocket fuel and mushrooms,"
5438,117,"poison mushrooms; it's a bad time,"
5439,117,a dog-sick time-curtain
5440,117,"act 3, standing room only,"
5441,117,"sold out, sold out, sold out again,"
5442,117,"by god,by somebody and something,"
5443,117,by rockets and generals and
5444,117,"leaders, by poets , doctors, comedians,"
5445,117,by manufacturers of soup
5446,117,"and biscuits, janus-faced hucksters"
5447,117,of their own indexterity;
5448,117,i can now see now the coal-slick
5449,117,"contaminated fields, a snail or 2,"
5450,117,"bile, obsidian, a fish or 3"
5451,117,"in the shallows, an obloquy of our"
5452,117,"source and our sight,,,"
5453,117,has this happened before? is history
5454,117,"a circle that catches itself by the tail,"
5455,117,"a dream, a nightmare,"
5456,117,"a general's dream, a presidents dream,"
5457,117,"a dictators dream,"
5458,117,can't we awaken?
5459,117,or are the forces of life greater than we are?
5460,117,"can't we awaken? must we forever,"
5461,117,"dear friends, die in our sleep?"

5589,121,first time my father overheard me listening to
5590,121,"this bit of music he asked me,"
5591,121,what is it?
5592,121,"it's called love for three oranges,"
5593,121,"i informed him,"
5594,121,"boy, he said, that's getting it"
5595,121,"cheap,"
5596,121,"he meant sex,"
5597,121,listening to it
5598,121,i always imagined three oranges
5599,121,"sitting there,"
5600,121,you know how orange they can
5601,121,"get,"
5602,121,"so mightily orange,"
5603,121,maybe prokofiev had meant
5604,121,what my father
5605,121,"thought,"
5606,121,"if so, i preferred it the"
5607,121,other way
5608,121,the most horrible thing
5609,121,i could think of
5610,121,was part of me being
5611,121,what ejaculated out of the
5612,121,end of his
5613,121,"stupid penis,"
5614,121,i will never forgive him
5615,121,"for that,"
5616,121,his trick that i am stuck
5617,121,"with,"
5618,121,i find no nobility in
5619,121,"parenthood,"
5620,121,i say kill the father
5621,121,before he makes more
5622,121,such as
5623,121,"i,"
5624,121,from onthebus - 1992
5625,122,some say we should keep personal remorse from the
5626,122,"poem,"
5627,122,"stay abstract, and there is some reason in this,"
5628,122,but jezus;
5629,122,twelve poems gone and i don't keep carbons and you have
5630,122,my
5631,122,"paintings too, my best ones; its stifling,"
5632,122,are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?
5633,122,why didn't you take my money? they usually do
5634,122,"from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner,"
5635,122,next time take my left arm or a fifty
5636,122,"but not my poems,"
5637,122,i'm not shakespeare
5638,122,but sometime simply
5639,122,"there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise;"
5640,122,there'll always be money and whores and drunkards
5641,122,"down to the last bomb,"
5642,122,"but as god said,"
5643,122,"crossing his legs,"
5644,122,i see where i have made plenty of poets
5645,122,but not so very much
5646,122,"poetry,"
5647,123,don't undress my love
5648,123,"you might find a mannequin,"
5649,123,don't undress the mannequin
5650,123,you might find
5651,123,"my love,"
5652,123,she's long ago
5653,123,"forgotten me,"
5654,123,she's trying on a new

5657,123,coquette
5658,123,"than ever,"

5666,123,she didn't do
5667,123,anything

5675,124,i hope some of them have a bottle of
5676,124,"red,"
5677,124,it's when you're on the row
5678,124,that you notice that
5679,124,everything
5680,124,is owned
5681,124,and that there are locks on
5682,124,"everything,"
5683,124,this is the way a democracy
5684,124,"works,"
5685,124,"you get what you can,"
5686,124,try to keep that
5687,124,and add to it
5688,124,"if possible,"
5689,124,this is the way a dictatorship
5690,124,works too
5691,124,only they either enslave or
5692,124,destroy their
5693,124,"derelicts,"
5694,124,"we just forgot ours,"

5703,125,think of this when you
5704,125,kill a

5706,125,pick up a razor to
5707,125,shave

5712,126,they found him walking along the freeway
5713,126,all red in
5714,126,front
5715,126,he had taken a rusty tin can
5716,126,and cut off his sexual
5717,126,machinery
5718,126,as if to say --
5719,126,see what you've done to
5720,126,me? you might as well have the
5721,126,"rest,"
5722,126,
5723,126,and he put part of him
5724,126,in one pocket and
5725,126,part of him in
5726,126,another
5727,126,"and that's how they found him,"
5728,126,walking
5729,126,"along,"
5730,126,
5731,126,they gave him over to the
5732,126,doctors
5733,126,who tried to sew the parts
5734,126,back
5735,126,on
5736,126,but the parts were
5737,126,quite contented
5738,126,the way they
5739,126,"were,"
5740,126,
5741,126,i think sometimes of all of the good
5742,126,ass
5743,126,turned over to the
5744,126,monsters of the
5745,126,"world,"
5746,126,
5747,126,maybe it was his protest against
5748,126,this or
5749,126,his protest
5750,126,against
5751,126,"everything,"
5752,126,
5753,126,a one man
5754,126,freedom march
5755,126,that never squeezed in
5756,126,between
5757,126,the concert reviews and the
5758,126,baseball
5759,126,"scores,"

5762,126,bless
5763,126,"him,"
5764,127,call it the greenhouse effect or whatever
5765,127,"but it just doesn't rain like it used to,"
5766,127,i particularly remember the rains of the
5767,127,"depression era,"
5768,127,there wasn't any money but there was
5769,127,"plenty of rain,"
5770,127,it wouldn't rain for just a night or
5771,127,"a day,"
5772,127,it would rain for 7 days and 7
5773,127,nights
5774,127,and in los angeles the storm drains
5775,127,weren't built to carry off that much
5776,127,water
5777,127,and the rain came down thick and
5778,127,mean and
5779,127,steady
5780,127,and you heard it banging against
5781,127,the roofs and into the ground
5782,127,waterfalls of it came down
5783,127,from roofs
5784,127,and there was hail
5785,127,big rocks of ice
5786,127,bombing
5787,127,exploding smashing into things
5788,127,and the rain
5789,127,just wouldn't
5790,127,stop
5791,127,and all the roofs leaked-
5792,127,"dishpans,"
5793,127,cooking pots
5794,127,were placed all about;
5795,127,they dripped loudly
5796,127,and had to be emptied
5797,127,again and
5798,127,"again,"
5799,127,"the rain came up over the street curbings,"
5800,127,"across the lawns, climbed up the steps and"
5801,127,"entered the houses,"
5802,127,"there were mops and bathroom towels,"
5803,127,and the rain often came up through the
5804,127,"toilets,bubbling, brown, crazy,whirling,"
5805,127,"and all the old cars stood in the streets,"
5806,127,cars that had problems starting on a
5807,127,"sunny day,"
5808,127,and the jobless men stood
5809,127,looking out the windows
5810,127,at the old machines dying
5811,127,"like living things out there,"
5812,127,"the jobless men,"
5813,127,failures in a failing time
5814,127,were imprisoned in their houses with their
5815,127,wives and children
5816,127,and their
5817,127,"pets,"
5818,127,the pets refused to go out
5819,127,and left their waste in
5820,127,"strange places,"
5821,127,the jobless men went mad
5822,127,confined with
5823,127,"their once beautiful wives,"
5824,127,there were terrible arguments
5825,127,as notices of foreclosure
5826,127,"fell into the mailbox,"
5827,127,"rain and hail, cans of beans,"
5828,127,bread without butter;fried
5829,127,"eggs, boiled eggs, poached"
5830,127,eggs; peanut butter
5831,127,"sandwiches, and an invisible"
5832,127,"chicken in every pot,"
5833,127,"my father, never a good man"
5834,127,"at best, beat my mother"
5835,127,when it rained
5836,127,as i threw myself
5837,127,"between them,"
5838,127,"the legs, the knees, the"
5839,127,screams
5840,127,until they
5841,127,"separated,"
5842,127,"i'll kill you, i screamed"
5843,127,"at him, you hit her again"
5844,127,and i'll kill you!
5845,127,get that son-of-a-bitching
5846,127,kid out of here!
5847,127,"no, henry, you stay with"
5848,127,your mother!
5849,127,all the households were under
5850,127,siege but i believe that ours
5851,127,held more terror than the
5852,127,"average,"
5853,127,and at night
5854,127,as we attempted to sleep
5855,127,the rains still came down
5856,127,and it was in bed
5857,127,in the dark
5858,127,watching the moon against
5859,127,the scarred window
5860,127,so bravely
5861,127,holding out
5862,127,"most of the rain,"
5863,127,i thought of noah and the
5864,127,ark
5865,127,"and i thought, it has come"
5866,127,"again,"
5867,127,we all thought
5868,127,"that,"
5869,127,"and then, at once, it would"
5870,127,"stop,"
5871,127,and it always seemed to
5872,127,stop
5873,127,"around 5 or 6 a,m,,"
5874,127,"peaceful then,"
5875,127,but not an exact silence
5876,127,because things continued to
5877,127,drip
5878,127, drip
5879,127,   drip
5880,127,
5881,127,and there was no smog then
5882,127,"and by 8 a,m,"
5883,127,there was a
5884,127,"blazing yellow sunlight,"
5885,127,van gogh yellow-
5886,127,"crazy, blinding!"
5887,127,and then
5888,127,the roof drains
5889,127,relieved of the rush of
5890,127,water
5891,127,"began to expand in the warmth,"
5892,127,pang!pang!pang!
5893,127,and everybody got up and looked outside
5894,127,and there were all the lawns
5895,127,still soaked
5896,127,greener than green will ever
5897,127,be
5898,127,and there were birds
5899,127,on the lawn
5900,127,"chirping like mad,"
5901,127,they hadn't eaten decently
5902,127,for 7 days and 7 nights
5903,127,and they were weary of
5904,127,berries
5905,127,and
5906,127,they waited as the worms
5907,127,"rose to the top,"
5908,127,"half drowned worms,"
5909,127,the birds plucked them
5910,127,up
5911,127,and gobbled them
5912,127,down;there were
5913,127,"blackbirds and sparrows,"
5914,127,the blackbirds tried to
5915,127,drive the sparrows off
5916,127,"but the sparrows,"
5917,127,"maddened with hunger,"
5918,127,"smaller and quicker,"
5919,127,got their
5920,127,"due,"
5921,127,the men stood on their porches
5922,127,"smoking cigarettes,"
5923,127,now knowing
5924,127,they'd have to go out
5925,127,there
5926,127,to look for that job
5927,127,that probably wasn't
5928,127,"there, to start that car"
5929,127,that probably wouldn't
5930,127,"start,"
5931,127,and the once beautiful
5932,127,wives
5933,127,stood in their bathrooms
5934,127,"combing their hair,"
5935,127,"applying makeup,"
5936,127,trying to put their world back
5937,127,"together again,"
5938,127,trying to forget that
5939,127,awful sadness that
5940,127,"gripped them,"
5941,127,wondering what they could
5942,127,fix for
5943,127,"breakfast,"
5944,127,and on the radio
5945,127,we were told that
5946,127,school was now
5947,127,"open,"
5948,127,and
5949,127,soon
5950,127,there i was
5951,127,"on the way to school,"
5952,127,massive puddles in the
5953,127,"street,"
5954,127,the sun like a new
5955,127,"world,"
5956,127,my parents back in that
5957,127,"house,"
5958,127,i arrived at my classroom
5959,127,"on time,"
5960,127,"mrs, sorenson greeted us"
5961,127,"with, we won't have our"
5962,127,"usual recess, the grounds"
5963,127,"are too wet,"
5964,127,aw! most of the boys
5965,127,"went,"
5966,127,but we are going to do
5967,127,something special at
5968,127,"recess, she went on,"
5969,127,and it will be
5970,127,fun!
5971,127,"well, we all wondered"
5972,127,what that would
5973,127,be
5974,127,and the two hour wait
5975,127,seemed a long time
5976,127,"as mrs,sorenson"
5977,127,went about
5978,127,teaching her
5979,127,"lessons,"
5980,127,i looked at the little
5981,127,"girls, they looked so"
5982,127,pretty and clean and
5983,127,"alert,"
5984,127,they sat still and
5985,127,straight
5986,127,and their hair was
5987,127,beautiful
5988,127,in the california
5989,127,"sunshine,"
5990,127,the the recess bells rang
5991,127,and we all waited for the
5992,127,"fun,"
5993,127,"then mrs, sorenson told us,"
5994,127,"now, what we are going to"
5995,127,do is we are going to tell
5996,127,each other what we did
5997,127,during the rainstorm!
5998,127,we'll begin in the front row
5999,127,and go right around!
6000,127,"now, michael, you're first!, , ,"
6001,127,"well, we all began to tell"
6002,127,"our stories, michael began"
6003,127,"and it went on and on,"
6004,127,and soon we realized that
6005,127,"we were all lying, not"
6006,127,exactly lying but mostly
6007,127,lying and some of the boys
6008,127,began to snicker and some
6009,127,of the girls began to give
6010,127,them dirty looks and
6011,127,"mrs,sorenson said,"
6012,127,all right! i demand a
6013,127,modicum of silence
6014,127,here!
6015,127,i am interested in what
6016,127,you did
6017,127,during the rainstorm
6018,127,even if you
6019,127,aren't!
6020,127,so we had to tell our
6021,127,stories and they were
6022,127,"stories,"
6023,127,one girl said that
6024,127,when the rainbow first
6025,127,came
6026,127,she saw god's face
6027,127,"at the end of it,"
6028,127,"only she didn't say which end,"
6029,127,one boy said he stuck
6030,127,his fishing pole
6031,127,out the window
6032,127,and caught a little
6033,127,fish
6034,127,and fed it to his
6035,127,"cat,"
6036,127,almost everybody told
6037,127,"a lie,"
6038,127,the truth was just
6039,127,too awful and
6040,127,"embarrassing to tell,"
6041,127,then the bell rang
6042,127,and recess was
6043,127,"over,"
6044,127,"thank you, said mrs,"
6045,127,"sorenson, that was very"
6046,127,"nice,"
6047,127,and tomorrow the grounds
6048,127,will be dry
6049,127,and we will put them
6050,127,to use
6051,127,"again,"
6052,127,most of the boys
6053,127,cheered
6054,127,and the little girls
6055,127,sat very straight and
6056,127,"still,"
6057,127,looking so pretty and
6058,127,clean and
6059,127,"alert,"
6060,127,their hair beautiful in a sunshine that
6061,127,the world might never see
6062,127,"again,"
6063,127,and
6064,128,"what i liked about e,e, cummings"
6065,128,was that he cut away from
6066,128,the holiness of the
6067,128,word
6068,128,and with charm
6069,128,and gamble
6070,128,gave us lines
6071,128,that sliced through the
6072,128,"dung,"
6073,128,
6074,128,how it was needed!
6075,128,how we were withering
6076,128,away
6077,128,in the old
6078,128,tired
6079,128,"manner,"
6080,128,
6081,128,"of course, then came all"

6084,128,they copied him then
6085,128,as the others had

6087,128,"swinburne, byron, et"
6088,128,"al,"
6089,128,
6090,128,but there was only

6098,129,"at their best, there is gentleness in humanity,"
6099,129,"some understanding and, at times, acts of"
6100,129,courage
6101,129,"but all in all it is a mass, a glob that doesn't"
6102,129,"have too much,"
6103,129,it is like a large animal deep in sleep and
6104,129,"almost nothing can awaken it,"
6105,129,"when activated it's best at brutality,"
6106,129,"selfishness, unjust judgments, murder,"
6107,129,"what can we do with it, this humanity?"
6108,129,"nothing,"
6109,129,"avoid the thing as much as possible,"
6110,129,"treat it as you would anything poisonous, vicious"
6111,129,"and mindless,"
6112,129,"but be careful, it has enacted laws to protect"
6113,129,"itself from you,"
6114,129,"it can kill you without cause,"
6115,129,"and to escape it you must be subtle,"
6116,129,"few escape,"
6117,129,"it's up to you to figure a plan,"
6118,129,"i have met nobody who has escaped,"
6119,129,i have met some of the great and
6120,129,famous but they have not escaped
6121,129,for they are only great and famous within
6122,129,"humanity,"
6123,129,i have not escaped
6124,129,but i have not failed in trying again and
6125,129,"again,"

6170,131,the time of the garbage

6174,131,"she said, i want to see"
6175,131,"my rival, she did"
6176,131,"and then she said, o,"
6177,131,you're a cute little thing!
6178,131,next i knew there was a
6179,131,screech of wildcats-

6184,131,"shorts, i tried to"
6185,131,"separate them and fell,"
6186,131,"wrenched my knee, then"
6187,131,they were through the screen
6188,131,door and down the walk
6189,131,"and out into the street,"
6190,131,squadcars full of cops
6191,131,"arrived, a police heli-"
6192,131,"coptor circled overhead,"
6193,131,i stood in the bathroom
6194,131,"and grinned in the mirror,"
6195,131,it's not often at the age
6196,131,of 55 that such splendid
6197,131,"things occur,"
6198,131,better than the watts
6199,131,"riots,"
6200,131,the 34 year old
6201,131,"came back in, she had"
6202,131,pissed all over her-
6203,131,self and her clothing
6204,131,was torn and she was
6205,131,followed by 2 cops who
6206,131,"wanted to know why,"

6267,134,when god created love he didn't help most
6268,134,when god created dogs he didn't help dogs
6269,134,when god created plants that was average
6270,134,when god created hate we had a standard utility
6271,134,when god created me he created me
6272,134,when god created the monkey he was asleep
6273,134,when he created the giraffe he was drunk
6274,134,when he created narcotics he was high
6275,134,and when he created suicide he was low
6276,134,
6277,134,when he created you lying in bed
6278,134,he knew what he was doing
6279,134,he was drunk and he was high
6280,134,and he created the mountains and the sea and fire at the same time
6281,134,
6282,134,he made some mistakes
6283,134,but when he created you lying in bed
6284,134,"he came all over his blessed universe,"
6285,135,"starving there, sitting around the bars,"
6286,135,"and at night walking the streets for hours,"
6287,135,the moonlight always seemed fake
6288,135,"to me, maybe it was,"
6289,135,and in the french quarter i watched
6290,135,"the horses and buggies going by,"
6291,135,everybody sitting high in the open
6292,135,"carriages, the black driver, and in"
6293,135,"back the man and the woman,"
6294,135,"usually young and always white,"
6295,135,"and i was always white,"
6296,135,and hardly charmed by the
6297,135,"world,"
6298,135,new orleans was a place to
6299,135,"hide,"
6300,135,"i could piss away my life,"
6301,135,"unmolested,"
6302,135,"except for the rats,"
6303,135,the rats in my small dark room
6304,135,very much resented sharing it
6305,135,"with me,"
6306,135,they were large and fearless
6307,135,and stared at me with eyes
6308,135,that spoke
6309,135,an unblinking
6310,135,"death,"
6311,135,"women were beyond me,"
6312,135,they saw something
6313,135,"depraved,"
6314,135,there was one waitress
6315,135,a little older than
6316,135,"i, she rather smiled,"
6317,135,lingered when she
6318,135,brought my
6319,135,"coffee,"
6320,135,that was plenty for
6321,135,"me, that was"
6322,135,"enough,"
6323,135,there was something about
6324,135,"that city, though,"
6325,135,it didn't let me feel guilty
6326,135,that i had no feeling for the
6327,135,things so many others
6328,135,"needed,"
6329,135,"it let me alone,"
6330,135,sitting up in my bed
6331,135,"the lights out,"
6332,135,hearing the outside
6333,135,"sounds,"
6334,135,lifting my cheap

6336,135,letting the warmth of
6337,135,the grape
6338,135,enter

6340,135,as i heard the rats
6341,135,moving about the
6342,135,"room,"
6343,135,i preferred them
6344,135,to
6345,135,"humans,"
6346,135,"being lost,"
6347,135,being crazy maybe
6348,135,is not so bad
6349,135,if you can be
6350,135,"that way,"
6351,135,"undisturbed,"
6352,135,new orleans gave me
6353,135,"that,"
6354,135,nobody ever called
6355,135,"my name,"
6356,135,"no telephone,"
6357,135,"no car,"
6358,135,"no job,"
6359,135,"no anything,"
6360,135,me and the
6361,135,rats
6362,135,"and my youth,"
6363,135,"one time,"
6364,135,that time
6365,135,i knew
6366,135,even through the
6367,135,"nothingness,"
6368,135,it was a
6369,135,celebration
6370,135,of something not to

6372,135,but only
6373,135,"know,"
