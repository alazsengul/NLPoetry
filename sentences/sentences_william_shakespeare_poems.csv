2,0,"    my spirits to attend this double voice accorded,"
3,0,    and down i laid to list the sad-tuned tale;
4,0,"    ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,"
5,0,"    tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,"
6,0,"    storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain,"
7,0,
8,0,"    upon her head a platted hive of straw,"
9,0,"    which fortified her visage from the sun,"
10,0,    whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
11,0,"    the carcass of beauty spent and done,"
12,0,"    time had not scythed all that youth begun,"
13,0,"    nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,"
14,0,"    some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age,"
15,0,
16,0,"    oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,"
17,0,"    which on it had conceited characters,"
18,0,    laundering the silken figures in the brine
19,0,"    that season'd woe had pelleted in tears,"
20,0,    and often reading what contents it bears;
21,0,"    as often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,"
22,0,"    in clamours of all size, both high and low,"
23,0,
24,0,"    sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,"
25,0,    as they did battery to the spheres intend;
26,0,    sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
27,0,    to the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend
28,0,    their view right on; anon their gazes lend

30,0,"    the mind and sight distractedly commix'd,"
31,0,
32,0,"    her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,"
33,0,    proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
34,0,"    for some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,"
35,0,    hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;
36,0,"    some in her threaden fillet still did bide,"
37,0,"    and true to bondage would not break from thence,"
38,0,"    though slackly braided in loose negligence,"
39,0,
40,0,    a thousand favours from a maund she drew
41,0,"    of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,"
42,0,"    which one by one she in a river threw,"
43,0,    upon whose weeping margent she was set;
44,0,"    like usury, applying wet to wet,"
45,0,    or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall
46,0,"    where want cries some, but where excess begs all,"
47,0,
48,0,"    of folded schedules had she many a one,"
49,0,"    which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;"
50,0,    crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone
51,0,    bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;
52,0,"    found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,"
53,0,    with sleided silk feat and affectedly
54,0,"    enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy,"
55,0,
56,0,"    these often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,"
57,0,"    and often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear,"
58,0,"    cried 'o false blood, thou register of lies,"
59,0,    what unapproved witness dost thou bear!
60,0,    ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'
61,0,"    this said, in top of rage the lines she rents,"
62,0,"    big discontent so breaking their contents,"
63,0,
64,0,    a reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--
65,0,"    sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew"
66,0,"    of court, of city, and had let go by"
67,0,"    the swiftest hours, observed as they flew--"
68,0,"    towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,"
69,0,"    and, privileged by age, desires to know"
70,0,"    in brief the grounds and motives of her woe,"
71,0,
72,0,"    so slides he down upon his grained bat,"
73,0,    and comely-distant sits he by her side;
74,0,"    when he again desires her, being sat,"
75,0,"    her grievance with his hearing to divide,"
76,0,    if that from him there may be aught applied
77,0,"    which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,"
78,0,"    'tis promised in the charity of age,"
79,0,
80,0,"    'father,' she says, 'though in me you behold"
81,0,"    the injury of many a blasting hour,"
82,0,    let it not tell your judgment i am old;
83,0,"    not age, but sorrow, over me hath power,"
84,0,"    i might as yet have been a spreading flower,"
85,0,"    fresh to myself, if i had self-applied"
86,0,"    love to myself and to no love beside,"
87,0,
88,0,"    'but, woe is me! too early i attended"
89,0,    a youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--
90,0,"    of one by nature's outwards so commended,"
91,0,"    that maidens' eyes stuck over all his face,"
92,0,"    love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;"
93,0,"    and when in his fair parts she did abide,"
94,0,"    she was new lodged and newly deified,"
95,0,
96,0,    'his browny locks did hang in crooked curls;

99,0,"    what's sweet to do, to do will aptly find,"
100,0,"    each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,"
101,0,    for on his visage was in little drawn
102,0,"    what largeness thinks in paradise was sawn,"
103,0,
104,0,    'small show of man was yet upon his chin;
105,0,    his phoenix down began but to appear
106,0,    like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
107,0,"    whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear,"
108,0,    yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;
109,0,    and nice affections wavering stood in doubt
110,0,"    if best were as it was, or best without,"
111,0,
112,0,"    'his qualities were beauteous as his form,"
113,0,"    for maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;"
114,0,"    yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm"
115,0,"    as oft 'twixt may and april is to see,"
116,0,"    when winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be,"
117,0,    his rudeness so with his authorized youth
118,0,"    did livery falseness in a pride of truth,"

120,0,"    'well could he ride, and often men would say"
121,0,"    'that horse his mettle from his rider takes,"

132,0,"    accomplish'd in himself, not in his case,"
133,0,"    all aids, themselves made fairer by their place,"
134,0,    came for additions; yet their purposed trim

392,1,"in fair round belly with good capon lined,"
393,1,"with eyes severe and beard of formal cut,"

400,1,"turning again toward childish treble, pipes"
401,1,"and whistles in his sound, last scene of all,"
402,1,"that ends this strange eventful history,"

599,14,"but, lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,"
600,14,"a breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,"
601,14,"adonis' trampling courser doth espy,"
602,14,"and forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud;"
603,14,"the strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,"
604,14,"breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he,"
605,14,
606,14,"imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,"
607,14,and now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
608,14,"the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,"
609,14,whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;
610,14,the iron bit he crushes 'tween his teeth
611,14,"controlling what he was controlled with,"
612,14,
613,14,his ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane

615,14,"his nostrils drink the air, and forth again,"
616,14,"as from a furnace, vapours doth he send,"
617,14,"his eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,"
618,14,"shows his hot courage and his high desire,"
619,14,
620,14,"sometime her trots, as if he told the steps,"
621,14,with gentle majesty and modest pride;
622,14,"anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,"
623,14,"as who should say, 'lo! thus my strength is tried;"
624,14,and this i do to captivate the eye
625,14,"of the fair breeder that is standing by,'"
626,14,
627,14,"what recketh he his rider's angry stir,"
628,14,"his flattering 'holla,' or his 'stand, i say?'"
629,14,what cares he now for curb of pricking spur?
630,14,for rich caparisons or trapping gay?
631,14,"he sees his love, and nothing else he sees,"
632,14,"nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees,"
633,14,
634,14,"look, when a painter would surpass the life,"
635,14,"in limning out a well-proportion'd steed,"
636,14,"his art with nature's workmanship at strife,"
637,14,as if the dead the living should exceed;
638,14,"so did this horse excel a common one,"
639,14,"in shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone"
640,14,
641,14,"round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,"

643,14,"high crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,"
644,14,"thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide,"
645,14,"look, what a horse should have he did not lack,"
646,14,"save a proud rider on so proud a back,"
647,14,
648,14,"sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;"
649,14,anon he starts at stirring of a feather;
650,14,"to bid the wind a race he now prepares,"
651,14,and whe'r he run or fly they know not whether;
652,14,"for through his mane and tail the high wind sings,"
653,14,"fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings,"
654,14,
655,14,"he looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;"
656,14,she answers him as if she knew his mind;
657,14,"being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,"
658,14,"she puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,"
659,14,"spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,"
660,14,"beating his kind embracements with her heels,"
661,14,
662,14,"then, like a melancholy malcontent,"
663,14,"he vails his tail that, like a falling plume"
664,14,"cool shadow to his melting buttock lent,"
665,14,"he stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume,"
666,14,"his love, perceiving how he is enrag'd,"
667,14,"grew kinder, and his fury was assuag'd,"
668,14,
669,14,his testy master goeth about to take him;
670,14,"when lo! the unback'd breeder, full of fear,"
671,14,"jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,"
672,14,"with her the horse, and left adonis there,"
673,14,"as they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,"
674,14,"out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them,"
675,14,
676,14,"i prophesy they death, my living sorrow,"
677,14,"if thou encounter with the boar to-morrow,"
678,14,
679,14,"but if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul'd by me;"
680,14,"uncouple at the timorous flying hare,"
681,14,"or at the fox which lives by subtlety,"
682,14,"or at the roe which no encounter dare,"
683,14,"pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,"
684,14,"and on they well-breath'd horse keep with they hounds,"
685,14,
686,14,"and when thou hast on food the purblind hare,"
687,14,"mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles"
688,14,"how he outruns with winds, and with what care"
689,14,"he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles,"
690,14,the many musits through the which he goes
691,14,"are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes,"
692,14,
693,14,"sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,"
694,14,"to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,"
695,14,"and sometime where earth-delving conies keep,"
696,14,"to stop the loud pursuers in their yell,"
697,14,and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;
698,14,"danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear,"
699,14,
700,14,"for there his smell with other being mingled,"
701,14,"the hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,"
702,14,ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
703,14,with much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
704,14,"then do they spend their mouths, echo replies,"
705,14,"as if another chase were in the skies,"
706,14,
707,14,"by this, poor wat, far off upon a hill,"
708,14,"stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,"
709,14,"to hearken if his foes pursue him still,"
710,14,anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
711,14,and now his grief may be compared well
712,14,"to one sore sick that hears the passing-bell,"
713,14,
714,14,then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch
715,14,"turn, and return, indenting with the way;"
716,14,"each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,"
717,14,"each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay,"
718,14,"for misery is trodden on by many,"
719,14,"and being low never reliev'd by any,"
720,14,
721,14,"lie quietly, and hear a little more;"
722,14,"nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise,"
723,14,"to make thee hate the hunting of the boar,"
724,14,"unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,"
725,14,"applying this to that, and so to so;"
726,14,"for love can comment upon every woe,"
727,15,"from you have i been absent in the spring,"
728,15,"when proud-pied april, dressed in all his trim,"
729,15,"hath put a spirit of youth in everything,"
730,15,"that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him,"
731,15,"yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell"
732,15,"of different flowers in odor and in hue,"
733,15,"could make me any summer's story tell,"
734,15,"or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew,"
735,15,"nor did i wonder at the lily's white,"
736,15,nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
737,15,"they were but sweet, but figures of delight,"
738,15,"drawn after you, you pattern of all those,"
739,15,"yet seemed it winter still, and, you away,"
740,15,"as with your shadow i with these did play,"
741,16,"orpheus with his lute made trees,"
742,16,"    and the mountain tops that freeze,"
743,16,"      bow themselves, when he did sing,"
744,16,    to his music plants and flowers
745,16,    ever sprung; as sun and showers
746,16,"      there had made a lasting spring,"
747,16,
748,16,"    everything that heard him play,"
749,16,"    even the billows of the sea,"
750,16,"      hung their heads, and then lay by,"
751,16,"  in sweet music is such art,"
752,16,  killing care and grief of heart
753,16,"    fall asleep, or hearing, die,"
754,17,"sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,"
755,17,men were deceivers ever;
756,17,"one foot in sea, and one on shore,"
757,17,"to one thing constant never,"
758,17,"then sigh not so,"
759,17,"but let them go,"
760,17,"and be you blith and bonny,"
761,17,converting all your sounds of woe
762,17,"into hey nonny, nonny,"
763,17,
764,17,"sing no more ditties, sing no mo"
765,17,of dumps so dull and heavy;
766,17,"the fraud of men was ever so,"
767,17,"since summer first was leavy,"
768,17,"then sigh not so,"
769,17,"but let them go,"
770,17,"and be you blith and bonny,"
771,17,converting all your sounds of woe
772,17,"into hey nonny, nonny,"
773,18,when in the chronicle of wasted time
774,18,"  i see descriptions of the fairest wights,"
775,18,  and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
776,18,"  in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,"
777,18,"  then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,"
778,18,"  of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,"
779,18,  i see their antique pen would have express'd
780,18,"  even such a beauty as you master now,"
781,18,  so all their praises are but prophecies
782,18,"  of this our time, all you prefiguring;"
783,18,"  and, for they look'd but with divining eyes,"
784,18,"  they had not skill enough your worth to sing,"
785,18,"  for we, which now behold these present days,"
786,18,"  have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise,"
787,19,"music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?"
788,19,"sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy,"
789,19,"why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,"
790,19,or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
791,19,"if the true concord of well-tuned sounds,"
792,19,"by unions married, do offend thine ear,"
793,19,"they do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds"
794,19,"in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear,"
795,19,"mark how one string, sweet husband to another,"
796,19,"strikes each in each by mutual ordering,"
797,19,resembling sire and child and happy mother
798,19,"who all in one, one pleasing note do sing,"
799,19,"whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,"
800,19,"sings this to thee, 'thou single wilt prove none,'"
801,20,"not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul"
802,20,"of the wide world dreaming on things to come,"
803,20,"can yet the lease of my true love control,"
804,20,"suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom,"
805,20,the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd
806,20,and the sad augurs mock their own presage;
807,20,incertainties now crown themselves assur'd
808,20,"and peace proclaims olives of endless age,"
809,20,now with the drops of this most balmy time
810,20,"my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,"
811,20,"since, spite of him, i'll live in this poor rhyme,"
812,20,while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;
813,20,"and thou in this shalt find thy monument,"
814,20,"when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent,"
815,21,"o, for my sake do you with fortune chide,"
816,21,"the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,"
817,21,that did not better for my life provide
818,21,"than public means which public manners breeds,"
819,21,"thence comes it that my name receives a brand,"
820,21,and almost thence my nature is subdu'd
821,21,"to what it works in, like the dyer's hand,"
822,21,pity me then and wish i were renew'd;
823,21,"whilst, like a willing patient, i will drink"
824,21,potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
825,21,"no bitterness that i will bitter think,"
826,21,"nor double penance, to correct correction,"
827,21,"pity me then, dear friend, and i assure ye"
828,21,"even that your pity is enough to cure me,"
829,22,those lips that love's own hand did make
830,22,breath'd forth the sound that said i hate
831,22,"to me that languish'd for her sake,"
832,22,"but when she saw my woeful state,"
833,22,"straight in her heart did mercy come,"
834,22,"chiding that tongue, that ever sweet"
835,22,"was used in giving gentle doom,"
836,22,"and taught it thus anew to greet,"
837,22,'i hate' she alter'd with an end
838,22,that follow'd it as gentle day
839,22,"doth follow night, who like a fiend"
840,22,"from heaven to hell is flown away,"
841,22,"'i hate' from hate away she threw,"
842,22,"and sav'd my life, saying 'not you'"
843,23,let me not to the marriage of true minds
844,23,"admit impediments, love is not love"
845,23,"which alters when it alteration finds,"
846,23,"or bends with the remover to remove,"
847,23,o no! it is an ever-fixed mark
848,23,that looks on tempests and is never shaken;
849,23,"it is the star to every wandering bark,"
850,23,"whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken,"
851,23,"love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks"
852,23,"within his bending sickle's compass come,"
853,23,"love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,"
854,23,"but bears it out even to the edge of doom,"
855,23,"if this be error and upon me proved,"
856,23,"i never writ, nor no man ever loved,"
857,24,my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
858,24,"   coral is far more red than her lips' red,"
859,24,"   if snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;"
860,24,"   if hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head,"
861,24,"   i have seen roses damask'd, red and white,"
862,24,   but no such roses see i in her cheeks;
863,24,   and in some perfumes is there more delight
864,24,"   than in the breath that from my mistress reeks,"
865,24,"   i love to hear her speak, yet well i know"
866,24,"  that music hath a far more pleasing sound,"
867,24,"  i grant i never saw a goddess go,"
868,24,"  my mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground,"
869,24,"  and yet, by heaven, i think my love as rare"
870,24,"  as any she belied with false compare,"
871,25,"from fairest creatures we desire increase,"
872,25,"that thereby beauty's rose might never die,"
873,25,"but as the riper should by time decease,"
874,25,"his tender heir might bear his memory,"
875,25,"but thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,"
876,25,"feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,"
877,25,"making a famine where abundance lies,"
878,25,"thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel,"
879,25,thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
880,25,"and only herald to the gaudy spring,"
881,25,within thine own bud buriest thy content
882,25,"and, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding,"
883,25,"pity the world, or else this glutton be,"
884,25,"to eat the world's due, by the grave and thee,"
885,26,"when forty winters shall besiege thy brow,"
886,26,"and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,"
887,26,"thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,"
888,26,"will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held,"
889,26,"then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,"
890,26,"where all the treasure of thy lusty days,"
891,26,"to say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,"
892,26,"were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise,"
893,26,"how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,"
894,26,if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine
895,26,"shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'"
896,26,proving his beauty by succession thine!
897,26,"this were to be new made when thou art old,"
898,26,"and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold,"
899,27,"look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest"
900,27,now is the time that face should form another;
901,27,"whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,"
902,27,"thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother,"
903,27,for where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
904,27,disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
905,27,or who is he so fond will be the tomb
906,27,"of his self-love, to stop posterity?"
907,27,"thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee"
908,27,"calls back the lovely april of her prime,"
909,27,so thou through windows of thine age shall see
910,27,"despite of wrinkles this thy golden time,"
911,27,"but if thou live, remember'd not to be,"
912,27,"die single, and thine image dies with thee,"
913,28,"unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend"
914,28,upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
915,28,"nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,"
916,28,"and being frank she lends to those are free,"
917,28,"then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse"
918,28,the bounteous largess given thee to give?
919,28,"profitless usurer, why dost thou use"
920,28,"so great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?"
921,28,"for having traffic with thy self alone,"
922,28,"thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,"
923,28,"then how when nature calls thee to be gone,"
924,28,what acceptable audit canst thou leave?
925,28,"thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,"
926,28,"which, used, lives th' executor to be,"
927,29,when i have seen by time's fell hand defac'd
928,29,the rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
929,29,when sometime lofty towers i see down-ras'd
930,29,and brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
931,29,when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
932,29,"advantage on the kingdom of the shore,"
933,29,"and the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,"
934,29,increasing store with loss and loss with store;
935,29,"when i have seen such interchange of state,"
936,29,or state itself confounded to decay;
937,29,"ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,"
938,29,"that time will come and take my love away,"
939,29,"this thought is as a death, which cannot choose"
940,29,"but weep to have that which it fears to lose,"
941,30,"those hours, that with gentle work did frame"
942,30,"the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,"
943,30,will play the tyrants to the very same
944,30,and that unfair which fairly doth excel;
945,30,for never-resting time leads summer on
946,30,"to hideous winter, and confounds him there;"
947,30,"sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,"
948,30,"beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where,"
949,30,"then were not summer's distillation left,"
950,30,"a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,"
951,30,"beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,"
952,30,"nor it, nor no remembrance what it was,"
953,30,"but flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,"
954,30,"leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet,"
955,31,"they that have power to hurt and will do none,"
956,31,"that do not do the thing they most do show,"
957,31,"who, moving others, are themselves as stone,"
958,31,"unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,"
959,31,they rightly do inherit heaven's graces
960,31,and husband nature's riches from expense;
961,31,"they are the lords and owners of their faces,"
962,31,"others but stewards of their excellence,"
963,31,the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
964,31,"though to itself it only live and die,"
965,31,"but if that flower with base infection meet,"
966,31,"the basest weed outbraves his dignity,"
967,31,for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
968,31,"lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds,"
969,32,when i consider everything that grows
970,32,"holds in perfection but a little moment,"
971,32,that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
972,32,whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
973,32,"when i perceive that men as plants increase,"
974,32,"cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,"
975,32,"vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,"
976,32,and wear their brave state out of memory;
977,32,then the conceit of this inconstant stay
978,32,"sets you most rich in youth before my sight,"
979,32,where wasteful time debateth with decay
980,32,to change your day of youth to sullied night;
981,32,"and all in war with time for love of you,"
982,32,"as he takes from you, i engraft you new,"
983,33,"when, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,"
984,33,i all alone beweep my outcast state
985,33,and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
986,33,"and look upon myself and curse my fate,"
987,33,"wishing me like to one more rich in hope,"
988,33,"featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,"
989,33,"desiring this man's art and that man's scope,"
990,33,with what i most enjoy contented least;
991,33,"yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,"
992,33,"haply i think on thee, and then my state,"
993,33,like to the lark at break of day arising
994,33,"from sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;"
995,33,for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
996,33,"that then i scorn to change my state with kings,"
997,34,when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
998,34,"i summon up remembrance of things past,"
999,34,"i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought,"
1000,34,and with old woes new wail my dear times' waste;
1001,34,"then can i drown an eye, unus'd to flow,"
1002,34,"for precious friends hid in death's dateless night,"
1003,34,"and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,"
1004,34,"and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight,"
1005,34,"then can i grieve at grievances foregone,"
1006,34,and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
1007,34,"the sad account of fore-bemoanéd moan,"
1008,34,"which i new pay as if not paid before,"
1009,34,"but if the while i think on thee, dear friend,"
1010,34,"all losses are restor'd and sorrows end,"
1011,35,"if thou survive my well-contented day,"
1012,35,"when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover,"
1013,35,and shalt by fortune once more re-survey
1014,35,"these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,"
1015,35,"compare them with the bettering of the time,"
1016,35,"and though they be outstripp'd by every pen,"
1017,35,"reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,"
1018,35,"exceeded by the height of happier men,"
1019,35,"o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,"
1020,35,had my friend's muse grown with this growing age
1021,35,"a dearer birth than this his love had brought,"
1022,35,"to march in ranks of better equipage,"
1023,35,"but since he died and poets better prove,"
1024,35,"theirs for their style i'll read, his for his love,"
1025,36,"how can my muse want subject to invent,"
1026,36,"while thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse"
1027,36,"thine own sweet argument, too excellent"
1028,36,for every vulgar paper to rehearse?
1029,36,"o! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me"
1030,36,worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
1031,36,"for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,"
1032,36,when thou thy self dost give invention light?
1033,36,"be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth"
1034,36,than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
1035,36,"and he that calls on thee, let him bring forth"
1036,36,"eternal numbers to outlive long date,"
1037,36,"if my slight muse do please these curious days,"
1038,36,"the pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise,"
1039,37,"not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul"
1040,37,"    of the wide world dreaming on things to come,"
1041,37,"    can yet the lease of my true love control,"
1042,37,"    suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom,"
1043,37,    the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd
1044,37,    and the sad augurs mock their own presage;
1045,37,    incertainties now crown themselves assur'd
1046,37,"    and peace proclaims olives of endless age,"
1047,37,    now with the drops of this most balmy time
1048,37,"  my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,"
1049,37,"  since, spite of him, i'll live in this poor rhyme,"
1050,37,  while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;
1051,37,"  and thou in this shalt find thy monument,"
1052,37,"  when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent,"
1053,38," alas, 'tis true i have gone here and there"
1054,38,"    and made myself a motley to the view,"
1055,38,"    gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,"
1056,38,"    made old offences of affections new,"
1057,38,    most true it is that i have look'd on truth
1058,38,"    askance and strangely, but, by all above,"
1059,38,"    these blenches gave my heart another youth,"
1060,38,"    and worse essays prov'd thee my best of love,"
1061,38,"    now all is done, have what shall have no end!"
1062,38,"  mine appetite, i never more will grind"
1063,38,"  on newer proof, to try an older friend,"
1064,38,"  a god in love, to whom i am confin'd,"
1065,38,"  then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,"
1066,38,"  even to thy pure and most most loving breast,"
1067,39," poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,"
1068,39,"    [,,] these rebel powers that thee array,"
1069,39,"    why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,"
1070,39,    painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
1071,39,"    why so large cost, having so short a lease,"
1072,39,    dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
1073,39,"    shall worms, inheritors of this excess,"
1074,39,    eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
1075,39,"    then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss"
1076,39,  and let that pine to aggravate thy store;
1077,39,  buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
1078,39,"  within be fed, without be rich no more,"
1079,39,"  so shalt thou feed on death, that feeds on men,"
1080,39,"  and, death once dead, there's no more dying then,"
1081,40,let me not to the marriage of true minds
1082,40,"    admit impediments, love is not love"
1083,40,"    which alters when it alteration finds,"
1084,40,"    or bends with the remover to remove,"
1085,40,    o no! it is an ever-fixed mark
1086,40,    that looks on tempests and is never shaken;
1087,40,"    it is the star to every wand'ring bark,"
1088,40,"    whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken,"
1089,40,"    love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks"
1090,40,  within his bending sickle's compass come;
1091,40,"  love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,"
1092,40,"  but bears it out even to the edge of doom,"
1093,40,"  if this be error and upon me prov'd,"
1094,40,"  i never writ, nor no man ever lov'd,"
1095,41,th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
1096,41,"    is lust in action; and till action, lust"
1097,41,"    is perjur'd, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,"
1098,41,"    savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;"
1099,41,    enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
1100,41,"    past reason hunted; and, no sooner had,"
1101,41,"    past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,"
1102,41,"    on purpose laid to make the taker mad,"
1103,41,"    mad in pursuit, and in possession so;"
1104,41,"  had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;"
1105,41,"  a bliss in proof, and prov'd, a very woe;"
1106,41,"  before, a joy propos'd; behind, a dream,"
1107,41,  all this the world well knows; yet none knows well
1108,41,"  to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell,"
1109,42,"what is your substance, whereof are you made,"
1110,42,    that millions of strange shadows on you tend?
1111,42,"    since everyone hath, everyone, one shade,"
1112,42,"    and you, but one, can every shadow lend,"
1113,42,"    describe adonis, and the counterfeit"
1114,42,    is poorly imitated after you;
1115,42,"    on helen's cheek all art of beauty set,"
1116,42,"    and you in grecian tires are painted new,"
1117,42,"    speak of the spring and foison of the year,"
1118,42,"  the one doth shadow of your beauty show,"
1119,42,  the other as your bounty doth appear;
1120,42,"  and you in every blessed shape we know,"
1121,42,"  in all external grace you have some part,"
1122,42,"  but you like none, none you, for constant heart,"
1123,43,"like as the waves make towards the pebbl'd shore,"
1124,43,    so do our minutes hasten to their end;
1125,43,"    each changing place with that which goes before,"
1126,43,"    in sequent toil all forwards do contend,"
1127,43,"    nativity, once in the main of light,"
1128,43,"    crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,"
1129,43,"    crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,"
1130,43,"    and time that gave doth now his gift confound,"
1131,43,    time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
1132,43,"  and delves the parallels in beauty's brow,"
1133,43,"  feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,"
1134,43,"  and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow,"
1135,43,"  and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,"
1136,43,"  praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand,"
1137,44,when i have seen by time's fell hand defac'd
1138,44,    the rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
1139,44,    when sometime lofty towers i see down-ras'd
1140,44,    and brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
1141,44,    when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
1142,44,"    advantage on the kingdom of the shore,"
1143,44,"    and the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,"
1144,44,    increasing store with loss and loss with store;
1145,44,"    when i have seen such interchange of state,"
1146,44,  or state itself confounded to decay;
1147,44,"  ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,"
1148,44,"  that time will come and take my love away,"
1149,44,"  this thought is as a death, which cannot choose"
1150,44,"  but weep to have that which it fears to lose,"
1151,45,"tir'd with all these, for restful death i cry,"
1152,45,"    as, to behold desert a beggar born,"
1153,45,"    and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,"
1154,45,"    and purest faith unhappily forsworn,"
1155,45,"    and gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,"
1156,45,"    and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,"
1157,45,"    and right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,"
1158,45,"    and strength by limping sway disabled,"
1159,45,"    and art made tongue-tied by authority,"
1160,45,"  and folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,"
1161,45,"  and simple truth miscall'd simplicity,"
1162,45,"  and captive good attending captain ill,"
1163,45,"  tir'd with all these, from these would i be gone,"
1164,45,"  save that, to die, i leave my love alone,"
1165,46,that time of year thou mayst in me behold
1166,46,"    when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang"
1167,46,"    upon those boughs which shake against the cold,"
1168,46,"    bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang,"
1169,46,    in me thou see'st the twilight of such day
1170,46,"    as after sunset fadeth in the west,"
1171,46,"    which by and by black night doth take away,"
1172,46,"    death's second self, that seals up all in rest,"
1173,46,    in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
1174,46,"  that on the ashes of his youth doth lie,"
1175,46,"  as the death-bed whereon it must expire,"
1176,46,"  consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by,"
1177,46,"  this thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,"

1179,47,"they that have power to hurt and will do none,"

1181,47,"    who, moving others, are themselves as stone,"
1182,47,"    unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,"
1183,47,    they rightly do inherit heaven's graces
1184,47,    and husband nature's riches from expense;
1185,47,"    they are the lords and owners of their faces,"
1186,47,"    others but stewards of their excellence,"
1187,47,    the summer's flower is to the summer sweet
1188,47,"  though to itself it only live and die,"
1189,47,"  but if that flower with base infection meet,"
1190,47,"  the basest weed outbraves his dignity,"
1191,47,  for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
1192,47,"  lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds,"
1193,48,"devouring time, blunt thou the lion's paws,"
1194,48,    and make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
1195,48,"    pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,"
1196,48,    and burn the long-liv'd phoenix in her blood;
1197,48,"    make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,"
1198,48,"    and do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed time,"
1199,48,    to the wide world and all her fading sweets;
1200,48,"    but i forbid thee one more heinous crime,"
1201,48,"    o, carve not with the hours my love's fair brow,"
1202,48,  nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen!
1203,48,  him in thy course untainted do allow
1204,48,"  for beauty's pattern to succeeding men,"
1205,48,"  yet do thy worst, old time! despite thy wrong"
1206,48,"  my love shall in my verse ever live young,"
1207,49,when i consider everything that grows
1208,49,"    holds in perfection but a little moment,"
1209,49,    that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
1210,49,    whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
1211,49,"    when i perceive that men as plants increase,"
1212,49,"    cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,"
1213,49,"    vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,"
1214,49,    and wear their brave state out of memory;
1215,49,    then the conceit of this inconstant stay
1216,49,"  sets you most rich in youth before my sight,"
1217,49,  where wasteful time debateth with decay
1218,49,  to change your day of youth to sullied night;
1219,49,"  and all in war with time for love of you,"
1220,49,"  as he takes from you, i engraft you new,"
1221,50,shall i compare thee to a summer's day?
1222,50,"    thou art more lovely and more temperate,"
1223,50,"    rough winds do shake the darling buds of may,"
1224,50,"    and summer's lease hath all too short a date,"
1225,50,"    sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,"
1226,50,    and often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
1227,50,"    and every fair from fair sometime declines,"
1228,50,    by chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
1229,50,    but thy eternal summer shall not fade
1230,50,  nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
1231,50,"  nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,"
1232,50,"  when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,"
1233,50,"  so long as men can breathe or eyes can see,"
1234,50,"  so long lives this, and this gives life to thee,"
1235,51,"when, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,"
1236,51,    i all alone beweep my outcast state
1237,51,    and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
1238,51,"    and look upon myself and curse my fate,"
1239,51,"    wishing me like to one more rich in hope,"
1240,51,"    featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,"
1241,51,"    desiring this man's art and that man's scope,"
1242,51,    with what i most enjoy contented least;
1243,51,"    yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,"
1244,51,"  haply i think on thee, and then my state,"
1245,51,  like to the lark at break of day arising
1246,51,"  from sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;"
1247,51,  for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
1248,51,"  that then i scorn to change my state with kings,"
1249,52,let those who are in favour with their stars
1250,52,"    of public honour and proud titles boast,"
1251,52,"    whilst i, whom fortune of such triumph bars,"
1252,52,"    unlook'd for joy in that i honour most,"
1253,52,    great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
1254,52,"    but as the marigold at the sun's eye,"
1255,52,"    and in themselves their pride lies buried,"
1256,52,"    for at a frown they in their glory die,"
1257,52,"    the painful warrior famoused for fight,"
1258,52,"  after a thousand victories once foil'd,"
1259,52,"  is from the book of honour razed quite,"
1260,52,"  and all the rest forgot for which he toil'd,"
1261,52,"  then happy i, that love and am beloved"
1262,52,"  where i may not remove nor be removed,"
1263,53,when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
1264,53,"    i summon up remembrance of things past,"
1265,53,"    i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought,"
1266,53,"    and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste,"
1267,53,"    then can i drown an eye, unus'd to flow,"
1268,53,"    for precious friends hid in death's dateless night,"
1269,53,"    and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,"
1270,53,    and moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;
1271,53,"    then can i grieve at grievances foregone,"
1272,53,  and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
1273,53,"  the sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,"
1274,53,"  which i new pay as if not paid before,"
1275,53,"  but if the while i think on thee, dear friend,"
1276,53,"  all losses are restor'd, and sorrows end,"
1277,54,full many a glorious morning have i seen
1278,54,"    flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,"
1279,54,"    kissing with golden face the meadows green,"
1280,54,    gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
1281,54,    anon permit the basest clouds to ride
1282,54,    with ugly rack on his celestial face
1283,54,"    and from the forlorn world his visage hide,"
1284,54,"    stealing unseen to west with this disgrace,"
1285,54,    even so my sun one early morn did shine
1286,54,  with all-triumphant splendour on my brow;
1287,54,"  but out, alack! he was but one hour mine;"
1288,54,"  the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now,"
1289,54,  yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
1290,54,"  suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth,"
1291,55,"when daisies pied, and violets blue,"
1292,55,"and lady-smocks all silver-white,"

1370,57,and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
1371,57,"suspect i may, but not directly tell;"
1372,57,"for being both to me, both to each friend,"

1654,58,

1661,58,   distance and no space was seen
1662,58,"   'twixt this turtle and his queen,"
1663,58,"   but in them it were a wonder,"
1664,58,
1665,58,   so between them love did shine
1666,58,   that the turtle saw his right
1667,58,"   flaming in the phoenix' sight,"
1668,58,"   either was the other's mine,"
1669,58,
1670,58,   property was thus appalled
1671,58,   that the self was not the same;
1672,58,   single nature's double name
1673,58,"   neither two nor one was called,"
1674,58,
1675,58,"   reason, in itself confounded,"
1676,58,"   saw division grow together,"
1677,58,"   to themselves yet either neither,"

1679,58,
1680,58,"   that it cried, how true a twain"
1681,58,   seemeth this concordant one!
1682,58,"   love has reason, reason none,"
1683,58,"   if what parts can so remain,"
1684,58,
1685,58,   whereupon it made this threne
1686,58,"   to the phoenix and the dove,"
1687,58,"   co-supremes and stars of love,"

1743,60,"contrary to the roman laws and customs, not requiring or staying for the"
1744,60,"people's suffrages, had possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied"
1745,60,"with his sons and other noblemen of rome, to besiege ardea, during which"
1746,60,siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of
1747,60,"sextus tarquinius, the king's son, in their discourses after supper every"
1748,60,"one commended the virtues of his own wife, among whom collatinus extolled"
1749,60,"the incomparable chastity of his wife lucretia, in that pleasant humour"
1750,60,"they posted to rome; and intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to"
1751,60,"make trial of that which every one had before avouched, only collatinus"
1752,60,"finds his wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her"
1753,60,"maids, the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several"
1754,60,"disports, whereupon the noblemen yielded collatinus the victory, and his"
1755,60,"wife the fame, at that time sextus tarquinius being inflamed with lucrece'"
1756,60,"beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the rest"
1757,60,"back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself,"
1758,60,"and was, according to his estate, royally entertained and lodged by lucrece"
1759,60,"at collatium, the same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber,"
1760,60,"violently ravished her, and early in the morning speedeth away, lucrece, in"
1761,60,"this lamentable plight, hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to rome for her"
1762,60,"father, another to the camp for collatine, they came, the one accompanied"
1763,60,"with junius brutus, the other with publius valerius; and finding lucrece"
1764,60,"attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow, she, first"
1765,60,"taking an oath of them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole"
1766,60,"manner of his dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself, which done,"
1767,60,with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the
1768,60,"tarquins; and bearing the dead body to rome, brutus acquainted the people"
1769,60,"with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a bitter invective against"
1770,60,"the tyranny of the king, wherewith the people were so moved, that with one"
1771,60,"consent and a general acclamation the tarquins were all exiled, and the"
1772,60,"state government changed from kings to consuls,"
1773,60,
1774,60,"    from the besieged ardea all in post,"
1775,60,"    borne by the trustless wings of false desire,"
1776,60,"    lust-breathed tarquin leaves the roman host,"
1777,60,    and to collatium bears the lightless fire
1778,60,"    which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire"
1779,60,    and girdle with embracing flames the waist
1780,60,"    of collatine's fair love, lucrece the chaste,"
1781,60,
1782,60,    haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set
1783,60,    this bateless edge on his keen appetite;
1784,60,    when collatine unwisely did not let
1785,60,    to praise the clear unmatched red and white
1786,60,"    which triumph'd in that sky of his delight,"
1787,60,"    where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties,"
1788,60,"    with pure aspects did him peculiar duties,"
1789,60,
1790,60,"    for he the night before, in tarquin's tent,"
1791,60,    unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;
1792,60,    what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
1793,60,    in the possession of his beauteous mate;
1794,60,"    reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate,"
1795,60,"    that kings might be espoused to more fame,"
1796,60,"    but king nor peer to such a peerless dame,"
1797,60,
1798,60,    o happiness enjoy'd but of a few!
1799,60,"    and, if possess'd, as soon decay'd and done"
1800,60,    as is the morning's silver-melting dew
1801,60,    against the golden splendor of the sun!
1802,60,"    an expired date, cancell'd ere well begun,"
1803,60,"    honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,"
1804,60,"    are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms,"
1805,60,
1806,60,    beauty itself doth of itself persuade
1807,60,    the eyes of men without an orator;
1808,60,"    what needeth then apologies be made,"
1809,60,    to set forth that which is so singular?
1810,60,    or why is collatine the publisher
1811,60,    of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
1812,60,"    from thievish ears, because it is his own?"
1813,60,
1814,60,    perchance his boast of lucrece' sovereignty
1815,60,    suggested this proud issue of a king;
1816,60,"    for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be,"
1817,60,"    perchance that envy of so rich a thing,"
1818,60,"    braving compare, disdainfully did sting"
1819,60,"    his high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt"
1820,60,"    that golden hap which their superiors want,"
1821,60,
1822,60,    but some untimely thought did instigate
1823,60,"    his all-too-timeless speed, if none of those,"
1824,60,"    his honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,"
1825,60,"    neglected all, with swift intent he goes"
1826,60,"    to quench the coal which in his liver glows,"
1827,60,"    o rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,"
1828,60,"    thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!"
1829,60,
1830,60,"    when at collatium this false lord arrived,"
1831,60,"    well was he welcomed by the roman dame,"
1832,60,    within whose face beauty and virtue strived
1833,60,"    which of them both should underprop her fame,"
1834,60,"    when virtue bragg'd, beauty would blush for shame;"
1835,60,"    when beauty boasted blushes, in despite"
1836,60,"    virtue would stain that o'er with silver white,"
1837,60,
1838,60,"    but beauty, in that white intituled,"
1839,60,"    from venus' doves doth challenge that fair field,"
1840,60,"    then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red,"
1841,60,    which virtue gave the golden age to gild
1842,60,"    their silver cheeks, and call'd it then their shield;"
1843,60,"    teaching them thus to use it in the fight,"
1844,60,"    when shame assail'd, the red should fence the white,"
1845,60,
1846,60,"    this heraldry in lucrece' face was seen,"
1847,60,    argued by beauty's red and virtue's white
1848,60,"    of either's colour was the other queen,"
1849,60,"    proving from world's minority their right,"
1850,60,    yet their ambition makes them still to fight;
1851,60,"    the sovereignty of either being so great,"
1852,60,"    that oft they interchange each other's seat,"
1853,60,
1854,60,"    their silent war of lilies and of roses,"
1855,60,"    which tarquin view'd in her fair face's field,"
1856,60,    in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;
1857,60,"    where, lest between them both it should be kill'd,"
1858,60,    the coward captive vanquished doth yield
1859,60,"    to those two armies that would let him go,"
1860,60,"    rather than triumph in so false a foe,"
1861,60,
1862,60,"    now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,--"
1863,60,"    the niggard prodigal that praised her so,--"
1864,60,"    in that high task hath done her beauty wrong,"
1865,60,"    which far exceeds his barren skill to show,"
1866,60,    therefore that praise which collatine doth owe
1867,60,"    enchanted tarquin answers with surmise,"
1868,60,"    in silent wonder of still-gazing eyes,"
1869,60,
1870,60,"    this earthly saint, adored by this devil,"
1871,60,    little suspecteth the false worshipper;
1872,60,    for unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil;
1873,60,"    birds never limed no secret bushes fear,"
1874,60,    so guiltless she securely gives good cheer
1875,60,"    and reverend welcome to her princely guest,"
1876,60,"    whose inward ill no outward harm express'd,"
1877,60,
1878,60,"    for that he colour'd with his high estate,"
1879,60,    hiding base sin in plaits of majesty;
1880,60,"    that nothing in him seem'd inordinate,"
1881,60,"    save something too much wonder of his eye,"
1882,60,"    which, having all, all could not satisfy;"
1883,60,"    but, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,"
1884,60,"    that, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more,"
1885,60,
1886,60,"    but she, that never coped with stranger eyes,"
1887,60,"    could pick no meaning from their parling looks,"
1888,60,    nor read the subtle-shining secrecies
1889,60,"    writ in the glassy margents of such books,"
1890,60,"    she touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;"
1891,60,"    nor could she moralize his wanton sight,"
1892,60,"    more than his eyes were open'd to the light,"
1893,60,
1894,60,"    he stories to her ears her husband's fame,"
1895,60,    won in the fields of fruitful italy;
1896,60,"    and decks with praises collatine's high name,"
1897,60,    made glorious by his manly chivalry
1898,60,"    with bruised arms and wreaths of victory,"
1899,60,"    her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,"
1900,60,"    and, wordless, so greets heaven for his success,"
1901,60,
1902,60,"    far from the purpose of his coming hither,"
1903,60,"    he makes excuses for his being there,"
1904,60,    no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
1905,60,    doth yet in his fair welkin once appear;
1906,60,"    till sable night, mother of dread and fear,"
1907,60,"    upon the world dim darkness doth display,"
1908,60,"    and in her vaulty prison stows the day,"
1909,60,
1910,60,"    for then is tarquin brought unto his bed,"
1911,60,    intending weariness with heavy spright;
1912,60,"    for, after supper, long he questioned"
1913,60,"    with modest lucrece, and wore out the night,"
1914,60,    now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;
1915,60,"    and every one to rest themselves betake,"
1916,60,"    save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake,"
1917,60,
1918,60,    as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving
1919,60,    the sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;
1920,60,"    yet ever to obtain his will resolving,"
1921,60,"    though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining,"
1922,60,    despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining;
1923,60,"    and when great treasure is the meed proposed,"
1924,60,"    though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed,"
1925,60,
1926,60,"    those that much covet are with gain so fond,"
1927,60,"    for what they have not, that which they possess"
1928,60,"    they scatter and unloose it from their bond,"
1929,60,"    and so, by hoping more, they have but less;"
1930,60,"    or, gaining more, the profit of excess"
1931,60,"    is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,"
1932,60,"    that they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain,"
1933,60,
1934,60,    the aim of all is but to nurse the life
1935,60,"    with honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;"
1936,60,"    and in this aim there is such thwarting strife,"
1937,60,"    that one for all, or all for one we gage;"
1938,60,    as life for honour in fell battle's rage;
1939,60,    honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost
1940,60,"    the death of all, and all together lost,"
1941,60,
1942,60,    so that in venturing ill we leave to be
1943,60,    the things we are for that which we expect;
1944,60,"    and this ambitious foul infirmity,"
1945,60,"    in having much, torments us with defect"
1946,60,"    of that we have, so then we do neglect"
1947,60,"    the thing we have; and, all for want of wit,"
1948,60,"    make something nothing by augmenting it,"
1949,60,
1950,60,"    such hazard now must doting tarquin make,"
1951,60,    pawning his honour to obtain his lust;
1952,60,"    and for himself himself be must forsake,"
1953,60,"    then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?"
1954,60,"    when shall he think to find a stranger just,"
1955,60,"    when he himself himself confounds, betrays"
1956,60,    to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days?
1957,60,
1958,60,"    now stole upon the time the dead of night,"
1959,60,"    when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes,"
1960,60,"    no comfortable star did lend his light,"
1961,60,    no noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries;
1962,60,    now serves the season that they may surprise
1963,60,"    the silly lambs, pure thoughts are dead and still,"
1964,60,"    while lust and murder wake to stain and kill,"
1965,60,
1966,60,"    and now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed,"
1967,60,    throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm;
1968,60,    is madly toss'd between desire and dread;
1969,60,"    th' one sweetly flatters, th' other feareth harm;"
1970,60,"    but honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,"
1971,60,"    doth too too oft betake him to retire,"
1972,60,"    beaten away by brain-sick rude desire,"
1973,60,
1974,60,"    his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,"
1975,60,    that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;
1976,60,"    whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,"
1977,60,    which must be lode-star to his lustful eye;
1978,60,"    and to the flame thus speaks advisedly,"
1979,60,"    'as from this cold flint i enforced this fire,"
1980,60,"    so lucrece must i force to my desire,'"
1981,60,
1982,60,    here pale with fear he doth premeditate
1983,60,"    the dangers of his loathsome enterprise,"
1984,60,    and in his inward mind he doth debate
1985,60,"    what following sorrow may on this arise,"
1986,60,"    then looking scornfully, he doth despise"
1987,60,"    his naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,"
1988,60,"    and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust,"
1989,60,
1990,60,"    'fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not"
1991,60,"    to darken her whose light excelleth thine,"
1992,60,"    and die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot"
1993,60,    with your uncleanness that which is divine;
1994,60,"    offer pure incense to so pure a shrine,"
1995,60,    let fair humanity abhor the deed
1996,60,"    that spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed,"
1997,60,
1998,60,    'o shame to knighthood and to shining arms!
1999,60,    o foul dishonour to my household's grave!
2000,60,"    o impious act, including all foul harms!"
2001,60,    a martial man to be soft fancy's slave!
2002,60,    true valour still a true respect should have;
2003,60,"    then my digression is so vile, so base,"
2004,60,"    that it will live engraven in my face,"
2005,60,
2006,60,"    'yea, though i die, the scandal will survive,"
2007,60,    and be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
2008,60,"    some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,"
2009,60,    to cipher me how fondly i did dote;
2010,60,"    that my posterity, shamed with the note"
2011,60,"    shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin"
2012,60,"    to wish that i their father had not bin,"
2013,60,
2014,60,"    'what win i, if i gain the thing i seek?"
2015,60,"    a dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy,"
2016,60,    who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?
2017,60,    or sells eternity to get a toy?
2018,60,    for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?
2019,60,"    or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,"
2020,60,    would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?
2021,60,
2022,60,"    'if collatinus dream of my intent,"
2023,60,"    will he not wake, and in a desperate rage"
2024,60,"    post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?"
2025,60,"    this siege that hath engirt his marriage,"
2026,60,"    this blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,"
2027,60,"    this dying virtue, this surviving shame,"
2028,60,    whose crime will bear an ever-during blame?
2029,60,
2030,60,"    'o, what excuse can my invention make,"
2031,60,    when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?
2032,60,"    will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,"
2033,60,"    mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?"
2034,60,"    the guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;"
2035,60,"    and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,"
2036,60,"    but coward-like with trembling terror die,"
2037,60,
2038,60,"    'had collatinus kill'd my son or sire,"
2039,60,"    or lain in ambush to betray my life,"
2040,60,"    or were he not my dear friend, this desire"
2041,60,"    might have excuse to work upon his wife,"
2042,60,"    as in revenge or quittal of such strife,"
2043,60,"    but as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,"
2044,60,"    the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end,"
2045,60,
2046,60,"    'shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known,"
2047,60,"    hateful it is; there is no hate in loving,"
2048,60,"    i'll beg her love; but she is own,"
2049,60,"    the worst is but denial and reproving,"
2050,60,"    my will is strong, past reason's weak removing,"
2051,60,    who fears a sentence or an old man's saw
2052,60,"    shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe,'"
2053,60,
2054,60,"    thus, graceless, holds he disputation"
2055,60,"    'tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,"
2056,60,"    and with good thoughts make dispensation,"
2057,60,    urging the worser sense for vantage still;
2058,60,    which in a moment doth confound and kill
2059,60,"    all pure effects, and doth so far proceed,"
2060,60,"    that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed,"
2061,60,
2062,60,"    quoth he, 'she took me kindly by the hand,"
2063,60,"    and gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,"
2064,60,"    fearing some hard news from the warlike band,"
2065,60,"    where her beloved collatinus lies,"
2066,60,"    o, how her fear did make her colour rise!"
2067,60,"    first red as roses that on lawn we lay,"
2068,60,"    then white as lawn, the roses took away,"
2069,60,
2070,60,"    'and how her hand, in my hand being lock'd"
2071,60,    forced it to tremble with her loyal fear!
2072,60,"    which struck her sad, and then it faster rock'd,"
2073,60,    until her husband's welfare she did hear;
2074,60,"    whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer,"
2075,60,"    that had narcissus seen her as she stood,"
2076,60,"    self-love had never drown'd him in the flood,"
2077,60,
2078,60,    'why hunt i then for colour or excuses?
2079,60,    all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth;
2080,60,    poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;
2081,60,"    love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth,"
2082,60,"    affection is my captain, and he leadeth;"
2083,60,"    and when his gaudy banner is display'd,"
2084,60,"    the coward fights and will not be dismay'd,"
2085,60,
2086,60,"    'then, childish fear, avaunt! debating, die!"
2087,60,"    respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!"
2088,60,"    my heart shall never countermand mine eye,"
2089,60,    sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage;
2090,60,"    my part is youth, and beats these from the stage,"
2091,60,"    desire my pilot is, beauty my prize;"
2092,60,    then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?'
2093,60,
2094,60,"    as corn o'ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear"
2095,60,"    is almost choked by unresisted lust,"
2096,60,"    away he steals with open listening ear,"
2097,60,    full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust;
2098,60,"    both which, as servitors to the unjust,"
2099,60,"    so cross him with their opposite persuasion,"
2100,60,"    that now he vows a league, and now invasion,"
2101,60,
2102,60,"    within his thought her heavenly image sits,"
2103,60,"    and in the self-same seat sits collatine,"
2104,60,    that eye which looks on her confounds his wits;
2105,60,"    that eye which him beholds, as more divine,"
2106,60,    unto a view so false will not incline;
2107,60,"    but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,"
2108,60,    which once corrupted takes the worser part;
2109,60,
2110,60,"    and therein heartens up his servile powers,"
2111,60,"    who, flatter'd by their leader's jocund show,"
2112,60,"    stuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours;"
2113,60,"    and as their captain, so their pride doth grow,"
2114,60,"    paying more slavish tribute than they owe,"
2115,60,"    by reprobate desire thus madly led,"
2116,60,"    the roman lord marcheth to lucrece' bed,"
2117,60,
2118,60,"    the locks between her chamber and his will,"
2119,60,"    each one by him enforced, retires his ward;"
2120,60,"    but, as they open, they all rate his ill,"
2121,60,"    which drives the creeping thief to some regard,"
2122,60,    the threshold grates the door to have him heard;
2123,60,    night-wandering weasels shriek to see him there;
2124,60,"    they fright him, yet he still pursues his fear,"
2125,60,
2126,60,"    as each unwilling portal yields him way,"
2127,60,    through little vents and crannies of the place
2128,60,"    the wind wars with his torch to make him stay,"
2129,60,"    and blows the smoke of it into his face,"
2130,60,    extinguishing his conduct in this case;
2131,60,"    but his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,"
2132,60,"    puffs forth another wind that fires the torch,"
2133,60,
2134,60,"    and being lighted, by the light he spies"
2135,60,"    lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks,"
2136,60,"    he takes it from the rushes where it lies,"
2137,60,"    and griping it, the needle his finger pricks;"
2138,60,    as who should say 'this glove to wanton tricks
2139,60,    is not inured; return again in haste;
2140,60,"    thou see'st our mistress' ornaments are chaste,'"
2141,60,
2142,60,    but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;
2143,60,"    he in the worst sense construes their denial,"
2144,60,"    the doors, the wind, the glove, that did delay him,"
2145,60,    he takes for accidental things of trial;
2146,60,"    or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,"
2147,60,"    who with a lingering slay his course doth let,"
2148,60,"    till every minute pays the hour his debt,"
2149,60,
2150,60,"    'so, so,' quoth he, 'these lets attend the time,"
2151,60,"    like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,"
2152,60,"    to add a more rejoicing to the prime,"
2153,60,"    and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing,"
2154,60,    pain pays the income of each precious thing;
2155,60,"    huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands,"
2156,60,"    the merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands,'"
2157,60,
2158,60,"    now is he come unto the chamber-door,"
2159,60,"    that shuts him from the heaven of his thought,"
2160,60,"    which with a yielding latch, and with no more,"
2161,60,"    hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought,"
2162,60,"    so from himself impiety hath wrought,"
2163,60,"    that for his prey to pray he doth begin,"
2164,60,"    as if the heavens should countenance his sin,"
2165,60,
2166,60,"    but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,"
2167,60,    having solicited th' eternal power
2168,60,"    that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,"
2169,60,"    and they would stand auspicious to the hour,"
2170,60,"    even there he starts, quoth he, 'i must deflower,"
2171,60,"    the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact,"
2172,60,    how can they then assist me in the act?
2173,60,
2174,60,"    'then love and fortune be my gods, my guide!"
2175,60,"    my will is back'd with resolution,"
2176,60,    thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried;
2177,60,    the blackest sin is clear'd with absolution;
2178,60,"    against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution,"
2179,60,"    the eye of heaven is out, and misty night"
2180,60,"    covers the shame that follows sweet delight,'"
2181,60,
2182,60,"    this said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,"
2183,60,"    and with his knee the door he opens wide,"
2184,60,"    the dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch,"
2185,60,"    thus treason works ere traitors be espied,"
2186,60,    who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;
2187,60,"    but she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,"
2188,60,"    lies at the mercy of his mortal sting,"
2189,60,
2190,60,"    into the chamber wickedly he stalks,"
2191,60,"    and gazeth on her yet unstained bed,"
2192,60,"    the curtains being close, about he walks,"
2193,60,"    rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head,"
2194,60,    by their high treason is his heart misled;
2195,60,    which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon
2196,60,"    to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon,"
2197,60,
2198,60,"    look, as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,"
2199,60,"    rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;"
2200,60,"    even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun"
2201,60,"    to wink, being blinded with a greater light,"
2202,60,"    whether it is that she reflects so bright,"
2203,60,"    that dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;"
2204,60,"    but blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed,"
2205,60,
2206,60,"    o, had they in that darksome prison died!"
2207,60,    then had they seen the period of their ill;
2208,60,"    then collatine again, by lucrece' side,"
2209,60,"    in his clear bed might have reposed still,"
2210,60,"    but they must ope, this blessed league to kill;"
2211,60,    and holy-thoughted lucrece to their sight
2212,60,"    must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight,"
2213,60,
2214,60,"    her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,"
2215,60,    cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
2216,60,"    who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,"
2217,60,    swelling on either side to want his bliss;
2218,60,"    between whose hills her head entombed is,"
2219,60,"    where, like a virtuous monument, she lies,"
2220,60,"    to be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes,"
2221,60,
2222,60,"    without the bed her other fair hand was,"
2223,60,    on the green coverlet; whose perfect white
2224,60,"    show'd like an april daisy on the grass,"
2225,60,"    with pearly sweat, resembling dew of night,"
2226,60,"    her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,"
2227,60,"    and canopied in darkness sweetly lay,"
2228,60,"    till they might open to adorn the day,"
2229,60,
2230,60,"    her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;"
2231,60,    o modest wantons! wanton modesty!
2232,60,"    showing life's triumph in the map of death,"
2233,60,"    and death's dim look in life's mortality,"
2234,60,"    each in her sleep themselves so beautify,"
2235,60,"    as if between them twain there were no strife,"
2236,60,"    but that life lived in death, and death in life,"
2237,60,
2238,60,"    her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,"
2239,60,"    a pair of maiden worlds unconquered,"
2240,60,"    save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,"
2241,60,"    and him by oath they truly honoured,"
2242,60,    these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred;
2243,60,"    who, like a foul ursurper, went about"
2244,60,"    from this fair throne to heave the owner out,"
2245,60,
2246,60,    what could he see but mightily he noted?
2247,60,    what did he note but strongly he desired?
2248,60,"    what he beheld, on that he firmly doted,"
2249,60,"    and in his will his wilful eye he tired,"
2250,60,    with more than admiration he admired
2251,60,"    her azure veins, her alabaster skin,"
2252,60,"    her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin,"
2253,60,
2254,60,"    as the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey,"
2255,60,"    sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,"
2256,60,"    so o'er this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay,"
2257,60,    his rage of lust by gazing qualified;
2258,60,"    slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,"
2259,60,"    his eye, which late this mutiny restrains,"
2260,60,"    unto a greater uproar tempts his veins,"
2261,60,
2262,60,"    and they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,"
2263,60,"    obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting,"
2264,60,"    in bloody death and ravishment delighting,"
2265,60,"    nor children's tears nor mothers' groans respecting,"
2266,60,"    swell in their pride, the onset still expecting,"
2267,60,"    anon his beating heart, alarum striking,"
2268,60,"    gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking,"
2269,60,
2270,60,"    his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,"
2271,60,    his eye commends the leading to his hand;
2272,60,"    his hand, as proud of such a dignity,"
2273,60,"    smoking with pride, march'd on to make his stand"
2274,60,"    on her bare breast, the heart of all her land;"
2275,60,"    whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,"
2276,60,"    left there round turrets destitute and pale,"
2277,60,
2278,60,"    they, mustering to the quiet cabinet"
2279,60,"    where their dear governess and lady lies,"
2280,60,"    do tell her she is dreadfully beset,"
2281,60,"    and fright her with confusion of their cries,"
2282,60,"    she, much amazed, breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes,"
2283,60,"    who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,"
2284,60,"    are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd,"
2285,60,
2286,60,    imagine her as one in dead of night
2287,60,"    from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,"
2288,60,"    that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,"
2289,60,    whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking;
2290,60,"    what terror or 'tis! but she, in worser taking,"
2291,60,"    from sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view"
2292,60,"    the sight which makes supposed terror true,"
2293,60,
2294,60,"    wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears,"
2295,60,    like to a new-kill'd bird she trembling lies;
2296,60,"    she dares not look; yet, winking, there appears"
2297,60,"    quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes,"
2298,60,    such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries;
2299,60,"    who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,"
2300,60,"    in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights,"
2301,60,
2302,60,"    his hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--"
2303,60,"    rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!--"
2304,60,"    may feel her heart-poor citizen!--distress'd,"
2305,60,"    wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,"
2306,60,"    beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal,"
2307,60,"    this moves in him more rage and lesser pity,"
2308,60,"    to make the breach and enter this sweet city,"
2309,60,
2310,60,"    first, like a trumpet, doth his tongue begin"
2311,60,    to sound a parley to his heartless foe;
2312,60,"    who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,"
2313,60,"    the reason of this rash alarm to know,"
2314,60,    which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show;
2315,60,    but she with vehement prayers urgeth still
2316,60,"    under what colour he commits this ill,"
2317,60,
2318,60,"    thus he replies, 'the colour in thy face,"
2319,60,"    that even for anger makes the lily pale,"
2320,60,"    and the red rose blush at her own disgrace,"
2321,60,"    shall plead for me and tell my loving tale,"
2322,60,    under that colour am i come to scale
2323,60,"    thy never-conquer'd fort, the fault is thine,"
2324,60,"    for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine,"
2325,60,
2326,60,"    'thus i forestall thee, if thou mean to chide,"
2327,60,"    thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,"
2328,60,    where thou with patience must my will abide;
2329,60,"    my will that marks thee for my earth's delight,"
2330,60,    which i to conquer sought with all my might;
2331,60,"    but as reproof and reason beat it dead,"
2332,60,"    by thy bright beauty was it newly bred,"
2333,60,
2334,60,    'i see what crosses my attempt will bring;
2335,60,    i know what thorns the growing rose defends;
2336,60,    i think the honey guarded with a sting;
2337,60,"    all this beforehand counsel comprehends,"
2338,60,    but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends;
2339,60,"    only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,"
2340,60,"    and dotes on what he looks, 'gainst law or duty,"
2341,60,
2342,60,"    'i have debated, even in my soul,"
2343,60,"    what wrong, what shame, what sorrow i shall breed;"
2344,60,"    but nothing can affection's course control,"
2345,60,"    or stop the headlong fury of his speed,"
2346,60,"    i know repentant tears ensue the deed,"
2347,60,"    reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;"
2348,60,"    yet strive i to embrace mine infamy,'"
2349,60,
2350,60,"    this said, he shakes aloft his roman blade,"
2351,60,"    which, like a falcon towering in the skies,"
2352,60,"    coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,"
2353,60,"    whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies,"
2354,60,    so under his insulting falchion lies
2355,60,"    harmless lucretia, marking what he tells"
2356,60,"    with trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells,"
2357,60,
2358,60,"    'lucrece,' quoth he,'this night i must enjoy thee,"
2359,60,"    if thou deny, then force must work my way,"
2360,60,"    for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee,"
2361,60,"    that done, some worthless slave of thine i'll slay,"
2362,60,    to kill thine honour with thy life's decay;
2363,60,"    and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him,"
2364,60,"    swearing i slew him, seeing thee embrace him,"
2365,60,
2366,60,    'so thy surviving husband shall remain
2367,60,    the scornful mark of every open eye;
2368,60,"    thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,"
2369,60,"    thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy,"
2370,60,"    and thou, the author of their obloquy,"
2371,60,"    shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,"
2372,60,"    and sung by children in succeeding times,"
2373,60,
2374,60,"    'but if thou yield, i rest thy secret friend,"
2375,60,    the fault unknown is as a thought unacted;
2376,60,    a little harm done to a great good end
2377,60,"    for lawful policy remains enacted,"
2378,60,    the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
2379,60,"    in a pure compound; being so applied,"
2380,60,"    his venom in effect is purified,"
2381,60,
2382,60,"    'then, for thy husband and thy children's sake,"
2383,60,"    tender my suit, bequeath not to their lot"
2384,60,"    the shame that from them no device can take,"
2385,60,    the blemish that will never be forgot;
2386,60,"    worse than a slavish wipe or birth-hour's blot,"
2387,60,    for marks descried in men's nativity
2388,60,"    are nature's faults, not their own infamy,'"
2389,60,
2390,60,    here with a cockatrice' dead-killing eye
2391,60,    he rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
2392,60,"    while she, the picture of pure piety,"
2393,60,"    like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws,"
2394,60,"    pleads, in a wilderness where are no laws,"
2395,60,"    to the rough beast that knows no gentle right,"
2396,60,"    nor aught obeys but his foul appetite,"
2397,60,
2398,60,"    but when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,"
2399,60,"    in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding,"
2400,60,"    from earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,"
2401,60,"    which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding,"
2402,60,    hindering their present fall by this dividing;
2403,60,"    so his unhallow'd haste her words delays,"
2404,60,"    and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays,"
2405,60,
2406,60,"    yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,"
2407,60,"    while in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth,"
2408,60,"    her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly,"
2409,60,"    a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth,"
2410,60,"    his ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth"
2411,60,"    no penetrable entrance to her plaining,"
2412,60,"    tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining,"
2413,60,
2414,60,    her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fix'd
2415,60,    in the remorseless wrinkles of his face;
2416,60,"    her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd,"
2417,60,"    which to her oratory adds more grace,"
2418,60,    she puts the period often from his place;
2419,60,"    and midst the sentence so her accent breaks,"
2420,60,"    that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks,"
2421,60,
2422,60,"    she conjures him by high almighty jove,"
2423,60,"    by knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship's oath,"
2424,60,"    by her untimely tears, her husband's love,"
2425,60,"    by holy human law, and common troth,"
2426,60,"    by heaven and earth, and all the power of both,"
2427,60,"    that to his borrow'd bed he make retire,"
2428,60,"    and stoop to honour, not to foul desire,"
2429,60,
2430,60,"    quoth she, 'reward not hospitality"
2431,60,    with such black payment as thou hast pretended;
2432,60,    mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee;
2433,60,    mar not the thing that cannot be amended;
2434,60,    end thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended;
2435,60,    he is no woodman that doth bend his bow
2436,60,"    to strike a poor unseasonable doe,"
2437,60,
2438,60,"    'my husband is thy friend; for his sake spare me,"
2439,60,"    thyself art mighty; for thine own sake leave me,"
2440,60,"    myself a weakling; do not then ensnare me,"
2441,60,"    thou look'st not like deceit; do not deceive me,"
2442,60,"    my sighs, like whirlwinds, labour hence to heave thee,"
2443,60,"    if ever man were moved with woman moans,"
2444,60,"    be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans,"
2445,60,
2446,60,"    'all which together, like a troubled ocean,"
2447,60,"    beat at thy rocky and wreck-threatening heart,"
2448,60,    to soften it with their continual motion;
2449,60,"    for stones dissolved to water do convert,"
2450,60,"    o, if no harder than a stone thou art,"
2451,60,"    melt at my tears, and be compassionate!"
2452,60,"    soft pity enters at an iron gate,"
2453,60,
2454,60,"    'in tarquin's likeness i did entertain thee,"
2455,60,    hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?
2456,60,"    to all the host of heaven i complain me,"
2457,60,"    thou wrong'st his honour, wound'st his princely name,"
2458,60,"    thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same,"
2459,60,"    thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;"
2460,60,"    for kings like gods should govern everything,"
2461,60,
2462,60,"    'how will thy shame be seeded in thine age,"
2463,60,    when thus thy vices bud before thy spring!
2464,60,"    if in thy hope thou darest do such outrage,"
2465,60,    what darest thou not when once thou art a king?
2466,60,"    o, be remember'd, no outrageous thing"
2467,60,    from vassal actors can be wiped away;
2468,60,"    then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay,"
2469,60,
2470,60,    'this deed will make thee only loved for fear;
2471,60,"    but happy monarchs still are fear'd for love,"
2472,60,"    with foul offenders thou perforce must bear,"
2473,60,"    when they in thee the like offences prove,"
2474,60,"    if but for fear of this, thy will remove;"
2475,60,"    for princes are the glass, the school, the book,"
2476,60,"    where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look,"
2477,60,
2478,60,    'and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn?
2479,60,    must he in thee read lectures of such shame?
2480,60,    wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
2481,60,"    authority for sin, warrant for blame,"
2482,60,    to privilege dishonour in thy name?
2483,60,"    thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,"
2484,60,"    and makest fair reputation but a bawd,"
2485,60,
2486,60,"    'hast thou command? by him that gave it thee,"
2487,60,"    from a pure heart command thy rebel will,"
2488,60,"    draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,"
2489,60,"    for it was lent thee all that brood to kill,"
2490,60,"    thy princely office how canst thou fulfil,"
2491,60,"    when, pattern'd by thy fault, foul sin may say,"
2492,60,"    he learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way?"
2493,60,
2494,60,"    'think but how vile a spectacle it were,"
2495,60,"    to view thy present trespass in another,"
2496,60,    men's faults do seldom to themselves appear;
2497,60,"    their own transgressions partially they smother,"
2498,60,"    this guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother,"
2499,60,"    o, how are they wrapp'd in with infamies"
2500,60,    that from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!
2501,60,
2502,60,"    'to thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,"
2503,60,"    not to seducing lust, thy rash relier,"
2504,60,    i sue for exiled majesty's repeal;
2505,60,"    let him return, and flattering thoughts retire,"
2506,60,"    his true respect will prison false desire,"
2507,60,"    and wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,"
2508,60,"    that thou shalt see thy state and pity mine,'"
2509,60,
2510,60,"    'have done,' quoth he, 'my uncontrolled tide"
2511,60,"    turns not, but swells the higher by this let,"
2512,60,"    small lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide,"
2513,60,"    and with the wind in greater fury fret,"
2514,60,    the petty streams that pay a daily debt
2515,60,"    to their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls' haste"
2516,60,"    add to his flow, but alter not his taste,'"
2517,60,
2518,60,"    'thou art,' quoth she, 'a sea, a sovereign king;"
2519,60,"    and, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood"
2520,60,"    black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,"
2521,60,"    who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood,"
2522,60,"    if all these pretty ills shall change thy good,"
2523,60,"    thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed,"
2524,60,"    and not the puddle in thy sea dispersed,"
2525,60,
2526,60,"    'so shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave;"
2527,60,"    thou nobly base, they basely dignified;"
2528,60,"    thou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave,"
2529,60,"    thou loathed in their shame, they in thy pride,"
2530,60,    the lesser thing should not the greater hide;
2531,60,"    the cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,"
2532,60,"    but low shrubs wither at the cedar's root,"
2533,60,
2534,60,"    'so let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state'--"
2535,60,"    no more,' quoth he; 'by heaven, i will not hear thee,"
2536,60,"    yield to my love; if not, enforced hate,"
2537,60,"    instead of love's coy touch, shall rudely tear thee;"
2538,60,"    that done, despitefully i mean to bear thee"
2539,60,"    unto the base bed of some rascal groom,"
2540,60,"    to be thy partner in this shameful doom,'"
2541,60,
2542,60,"    this said, he sets his foot upon the light,"
2543,60,"    for light and lust are deadly enemies,"
2544,60,"    shame folded up in blind concealing night,"
2545,60,"    when most unseen, then most doth tyrannize,"
2546,60,"    the wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries;"
2547,60,    till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd
2548,60,"    entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold,"
2549,60,
2550,60,    for with the nightly linen that she wears
2551,60,    he pens her piteous clamours in her head;
2552,60,    cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
2553,60,"    that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed,"
2554,60,"    o, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!"
2555,60,"    the spots whereof could weeping purify,"
2556,60,"    her tears should drop on them perpetually,"
2557,60,
2558,60,"    but she hath lost a dearer thing than life,"
2559,60,"    and he hath won what he would lose again,"
2560,60,    this forced league doth force a further strife;
2561,60,    this momentary joy breeds months of pain;
2562,60,"    this hot desire converts to cold disdain,"
2563,60,"    pure chastity is rifled of her store,"
2564,60,"    and lust, the thief, far poorer than before,"
2565,60,
2566,60,"    look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,"
2567,60,"    unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,"
2568,60,"    make slow pursuit, or altogether balk"
2569,60,    the prey wherein by nature they delight;
2570,60,"    so surfeit-taking tarquin fares this night,"
2571,60,"    his taste delicious, in digestion souring,"
2572,60,"    devours his will, that lived by foul devouring,"
2573,60,
2574,60,"    o, deeper sin than bottomless conceit"
2575,60,    can comprehend in still imagination!
2576,60,"    drunken desire must vomit his receipt,"
2577,60,"    ere he can see his own abomination,"
2578,60,"    while lust is in his pride, no exclamation"
2579,60,"    can curb his heat or rein his rash desire,"
2580,60,"    till like a jade self-will himself doth tire,"
2581,60,
2582,60,"    and then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,"
2583,60,"    with heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace,"
2584,60,"    feeble desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,"
2585,60,"    like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case,"
2586,60,"    the flesh being proud, desire doth fight with grace,"
2587,60,"    for there it revels; and when that decays,"
2588,60,"    the guilty rebel for remission prays,"
2589,60,
2590,60,"    so fares it with this faultful lord of rome,"
2591,60,    who this accomplishment so hotly chased;
2592,60,"    for now against himself he sounds this doom,"
2593,60,"    that through the length of times he stands disgraced,"
2594,60,"    besides, his soul's fair temple is defaced;"
2595,60,"    to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares,"
2596,60,"    to ask the spotted princess how she fares,"
2597,60,
2598,60,"    she says, her subjects with foul insurrection"
2599,60,"    have batter'd down her consecrated wall,"
2600,60,    and by their mortal fault brought in subjection
2601,60,"    her immortality, and made her thrall"
2602,60,"    to living death and pain perpetual,"
2603,60,"    which in her prescience she controlled still,"
2604,60,"    but her foresight could not forestall their will,"
2605,60,
2606,60,"    even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth,"
2607,60,    a captive victor that hath lost in gain;
2608,60,"    bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,"
2609,60,"    the scar that will, despite of cure, remain;"
2610,60,"    leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain,"
2611,60,"    she bears the load of lust he left behind,"
2612,60,"    and he the burden of a guilty mind,"
2613,60,
2614,60,    he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
2615,60,    she like a wearied lamb lies panting there;
2616,60,    he scowls and hates himself for his offence;
2617,60,"    she, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear;"
2618,60,"    he faintly flies, sneaking with guilty fear;"
2619,60,"    she stays, exclaiming on the direful night;"
2620,60,"    he runs, and chides his vanish'd, loathed delight,"
2621,60,
2622,60,    he thence departs a heavy convertite;
2623,60,    she there remains a hopeless castaway;
2624,60,    he in his speed looks for the morning light;
2625,60,"    she prays she never may behold the day,"
2626,60,"    'for day,' quoth she, 'nights scapes doth open lay,"
2627,60,    and my true eyes have never practised how
2628,60,"    to cloak offences with a cunning brow,"
2629,60,
2630,60,    'they think not but that every eye can see
2631,60,    the same disgrace which they themselves behold;
2632,60,"    and therefore would they still in darkness be,"
2633,60,    to have their unseen sin remain untold;
2634,60,"    for they their guilt with weeping will unfold,"

2637,60,
2638,60,"    here she exclaims against repose and rest,"
2639,60,"    and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind,"
2640,60,"    she wakes her heart by beating on her breast,"
2641,60,"    and bids it leap from thence, where it may find"
2642,60,"    some purer chest to close so pure a mind,"
2643,60,    frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite

2648,60,    black stage for tragedies and murders fell!
2649,60,    vast sin-concealing chaos! nurse of blame!
2650,60,    blind muffled bawd! dark harbour for defame!
2651,60,    grim cave of death! whispering conspirator

2673,60,"    through night's black bosom should not peep again,"
2674,60,    so should i have co-partners in my pain;

2698,60,"    yea the illiterate, that know not how"
2699,60,"    to cipher what is writ in learned books,"

2703,60,    and fright her crying babe with tarquin's name;
2704,60,"    the orator, to deck his oratory,"
2705,60,    will couple my reproach to tarquin's shame;
2706,60,"    feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,"

2983,60,    the stained taste of violated troth;
2984,60,"    i will not wrong thy true affection so,"
2985,60,    to flatter thee with an infringed oath;
2986,60,"    this bastard graff shall never come to growth,"
2987,60,    he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
2988,60,"    that thou art doting father of his fruit,"
2989,60,
2990,60,"    'nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,"
2991,60,"    nor laugh with his companions at thy state,"
2992,60,    but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
2993,60,"    basely with gold, but stol'n from forth thy gate,"
2994,60,"    for me, i am the mistress of my fate,"
2995,60,"    and with my trespass never will dispense,"
2996,60,"    till life to death acquit my forced offence,"
2997,60,
2998,60,"    'i will not poison thee with my attaint,"
2999,60,    nor fold my fault in cleanly-coin'd excuses;
3000,60,"    my sable ground of sin i will not paint,"
3001,60,"    to hide the truth of this false night's abuses,"
3002,60,"    my tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,"
3003,60,"    as from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,"
3004,60,"    shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale,'"
3005,60,
3006,60,"    by this, lamenting philomel had ended"
3007,60,"    the well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,"
3008,60,    and solemn night with slow sad gait descended
3009,60,"    to ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow"
3010,60,"    lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow,"
3011,60,"    but cloudy lucrece shames herself to see,"
3012,60,"    and therefore still in night would cloister'd be,"
3013,60,
3014,60,"    revealing day through every cranny spies,"
3015,60,    and seems to point her out where she sits weeping;
3016,60,"    to whom she sobbing speaks, 'o eye of eyes,"
3017,60,"    why pry'st thou through my window? leave thy peeping,"
3018,60,"    mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping,"
3019,60,"    brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,"
3020,60,"    for day hath nought to do what's done by night,'"
3021,60,
3022,60,"    thus cavils she with every thing she sees,"
3023,60,"    true grief is fond and testy as a child,"
3024,60,"    who wayward once, his mood with nought agrees,"
3025,60,"    old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;"
3026,60,"    continuance tames the one; the other wild,"
3027,60,"    like an unpractised swimmer plunging still,"
3028,60,"    with too much labour drowns for want of skill,"
3029,60,
3030,60,"    so she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,"
3031,60,"    holds disputation with each thing she views,"
3032,60,    and to herself all sorrow doth compare;
3033,60,    no object but her passion's strength renews;
3034,60,"    and as one shifts, another straight ensues,"
3035,60,    sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
3036,60,"    sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords,"
3037,60,
3038,60,    the little birds that tune their morning's joy
3039,60,"    make her moans mad with their sweet melody,"
3040,60,    for mirth doth search the bottom of annoy;
3041,60,    sad souls are slain in merry company;
3042,60,"    grief best is pleased with grief's society,"
3043,60,    true sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
3044,60,"    when with like semblance it is sympathized,"
3045,60,
3046,60,    'tis double death to drown in ken of shore;
3047,60,    he ten times pines that pines beholding food;
3048,60,    to see the salve doth make the wound ache more;
3049,60,    great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
3050,60,"    deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,"
3051,60,"    who being stopp'd, the bounding banks o'erflows;"
3052,60,"    grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows,"
3053,60,
3054,60,"    'you mocking-birds,' quoth she, 'your tunes entomb"
3055,60,"    within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,"
3056,60,"    and in my hearing be you mute and dumb,"
3057,60,    my restless discord loves no stops nor rests;
3058,60,"    a woeful hostess brooks not merry guests,"
3059,60,    relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
3060,60,"    distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears,"
3061,60,
3062,60,"    'come, philomel, that sing'st of ravishment,"
3063,60,"    make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair,"
3064,60,"    as the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,"
3065,60,"    so i at each sad strain will strain a tear,"
3066,60,    and with deep groans the diapason bear;
3067,60,"    for burden-wise i'll hum on tarquin still,"
3068,60,"    while thou on tereus descant'st better skill,"
3069,60,
3070,60,"    'and whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part,"
3071,60,"    to keep thy sharp woes waking, wretched i,"
3072,60,"    to imitate thee well, against my heart"
3073,60,    will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye;
3074,60,"    who, if it wink, shall thereon fall and die,"
3075,60,"    these means, as frets upon an instrument,"
3076,60,"    shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment,"
3077,60,
3078,60,"    'and for, poor bird, thou sing'st not in the day,"
3079,60,"    as shaming any eye should thee behold,"
3080,60,"    some dark deep desert, seated from the way,"
3081,60,"    that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,"
3082,60,    will we find out; and there we will unfold
3083,60,"    to creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds,"
3084,60,"    since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds,'"
3085,60,
3086,60,"    as the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze,"
3087,60,"    wildly determining which way to fly,"
3088,60,"    or one encompass'd with a winding maze,"
3089,60,    that cannot tread the way out readily;
3090,60,"    so with herself is she in mutiny,"
3091,60,"    to live or die which of the twain were better,"
3092,60,"    when life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor,"
3093,60,
3094,60,"    'to kill myself,' quoth she, 'alack, what were it,"
3095,60,    but with my body my poor soul's pollution?
3096,60,    they that lose half with greater patience bear it
3097,60,"    than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion,"
3098,60,    that mother tries a merciless conclusion
3099,60,"    who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,"
3100,60,"    will slay the other and be nurse to none,"
3101,60,
3102,60,"    'my body or my soul, which was the dearer,"
3103,60,"    when the one pure, the other made divine?"
3104,60,"    whose love of either to myself was nearer,"
3105,60,    when both were kept for heaven and collatine?
3106,60,"    ay me! the bark peel'd from the lofty pine,"
3107,60,    his leaves will wither and his sap decay;
3108,60,"    so must my soul, her bark being peel'd away,"
3109,60,
3110,60,"    'her house is sack'd, her quiet interrupted,"
3111,60,    her mansion batter'd by the enemy;
3112,60,"    her sacred temple spotted, spoil'd, corrupted,"
3113,60,"    grossly engirt with daring infamy,"
3114,60,"    then let it not be call'd impiety,"
3115,60,    if in this blemish'd fort i make some hole

3118,60,    'yet die i will not till my collatine
3119,60,    have heard the cause of my untimely death;

3121,60,"    revenge on him that made me stop my breath,"
3122,60,"    my stained blood to tarquin i'll bequeath,"
3123,60,"    which by him tainted shall for him be spent,"

3129,60,"    the one will live, the other being dead,"
3130,60,    so of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred;

3132,60,"    my shame so dead, mine honour is new-born,"
3133,60,
3134,60,"    'dear lord of that dear jewel i have lost,"
3135,60,    what legacy shall i bequeath to thee?
3136,60,"    my resolution, love, shall be thy boast,"
3137,60,"    by whose example thou revenged mayest be,"
3138,60,"    how tarquin must be used, read it in me,"
3139,60,"    myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,"

3145,60,    mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound;
3146,60,    my shame be his that did my fame confound;
3147,60,    and all my fame that lives disbursed be
3148,60,"    to those that live, and think no shame of me,"
3149,60,
3150,60,"    'thou, collatine, shalt oversee this will;"
3151,60,    how was i overseen that thou shalt see it!
3152,60,    my blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
3153,60,"    my life's foul deed, my life's fair end shall free it,"
3154,60,"    faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say 'so be it,'"

3156,60,"    thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be,'"
3157,60,
3158,60,"    this plot of death when sadly she had laid,"
3159,60,"    and wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,"
3160,60,"    with untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid,"
3161,60,    whose swift obedience to her mistress hies;
3162,60,"    for fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies,"
3163,60,    poor lucrece' cheeks unto her maid seem so
3164,60,"    as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow,"
3165,60,
3166,60,"    her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow,"
3167,60,"    with soft-slow tongue, true mark of modesty,"
3168,60,"    and sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow,"
3169,60,    for why her face wore sorrow's livery;
3170,60,    but durst not ask of her audaciously
3171,60,"    why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so,"
3172,60,"    nor why her fair cheeks over-wash'd with woe,"
3173,60,
3174,60,"    but as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,"
3175,60,    each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
3176,60,    even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
3177,60,"    her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy"
3178,60,"    of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,"
3179,60,"    who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,"
3180,60,"    which makes the maid weep like the dewy night,"
3181,60,
3182,60,"    a pretty while these pretty creatures stand,"
3183,60,"    like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling,"
3184,60,    one justly weeps; the other takes in hand
3185,60,"    no cause, but company, of her drops spilling,"
3186,60,    their gentle sex to weep are often willing;
3187,60,"    grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts,"
3188,60,"    and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts,"
3189,60,
3190,60,"    for men have marble, women waxen, minds,"
3191,60,    and therefore are they form'd as marble will;
3192,60,"    the weak oppress'd, the impression of strange kinds"
3193,60,"    is form'd in them by force, by fraud, or skill,"
3194,60,"    then call them not the authors of their ill,"
3195,60,    no more than wax shall be accounted evil
3196,60,"    wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil,"
3197,60,
3198,60,"    their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,"
3199,60,    lays open all the little worms that creep;
3200,60,"    in men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain"
3201,60,"    cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep,"
3202,60,"    through crystal walls each little mote will peep,"
3203,60,"    though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,"
3204,60,"    poor women's faces are their own fault's books,"
3205,60,
3206,60,"    no man inveigh against the wither'd flower,"
3207,60,"    but chide rough winter that the flower hath kill'd,"
3208,60,"    not that devour'd, but that which doth devour,"
3209,60,"    is worthy blame, o, let it not be hild"
3210,60,"    poor women's faults, that they are so fulfill'd"
3211,60,"    with men's abuses, those proud lords, to blame,"
3212,60,"    make weak-made women tenants to their shame,"
3213,60,
3214,60,"    the precedent whereof in lucrece view,"

3216,60,"    of present death, and shame that might ensue"
3217,60,"    by that her death, to do her husband wrong,"
3218,60,"    such danger to resistance did belong,"
3219,60,    that dying fear through all her body spread;
3220,60,    and who cannot abuse a body dead?
3221,60,
3222,60,"    by this, mild patience bid fair lucrece speak"
3223,60,"    to the poor counterfeit of her complaining,"
3224,60,"    'my girl,' quoth she, 'on what occasion break"
3225,60,"    those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are"
3226,60,    raining?

3332,62,"    what follows more she murders with a kiss,"
3333,62,
3334,62,"    even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,"
3335,62,"    tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,"
3336,62,"    shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,"
3337,62,    till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;
3338,62,"    even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,"
3339,62,"    and where she ends she doth anew begin,"
3340,62,
3341,62,"    forced to content, but never to obey,"
3342,62,    panting he lies and breatheth in her face;
3343,62,"    she feedeth on the steam as on a prey,"
3344,62,"    and calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;"
3345,62,"    wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,"
3346,62,"    so they were dew'd with such distilling showers,"
3347,62,
3348,62,"    look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,"
3349,62,    so fasten'd in her arms adonis lies;
3350,62,"    pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,"
3351,62,"    which bred more beauty in his angry eyes,"
3352,62,    rain added to a river that is rank
3353,62,"    perforce will force it overflow the bank,"
3354,62,
3355,62,"    still she entreats, and prettily entreats,"
3356,62,    for to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;
3357,62,"    still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,"
3358,62,"    'twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale,"
3359,62,"    being red, she loves him best; and being white,"
3360,62,"    her best is better'd with a more delight,"
3361,62,
3362,62,"    look how he can, she cannot choose but love;"
3363,62,"    and by her fair immortal hand she swears,"
3364,62,"    from his soft bosom never to remove,"
3365,62,"    till he take truce with her contending tears,"
3366,62,"    which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;"
3367,62,"    and one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt,"
3368,62,
3369,62,"    upon this promise did he raise his chin,"
3370,62,"    like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,"
3371,62,"    who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;"
3372,62,    so offers he to give what she did crave;
3373,62,"    but when her lips were ready for his pay,"
3374,62,"    he winks, and turns his lips another way,"
3375,62,
3376,62,    never did passenger in summer's heat
3377,62,"    more thirst for drink than she for this good turn,"
3378,62,"    her help she sees, but help she cannot get;"
3379,62,"    she bathes in water, yet her fire must burn,"
3380,62,"    'o, pity,' 'gan she cry, 'flint-hearted boy!"
3381,62,    'tis but a kiss i beg; why art thou coy?
3382,62,
3383,62,"    'i have been woo'd, as i entreat thee now,"
3384,62,"    even by the stern and direful god of war,"
3385,62,"    whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,"
3386,62,    who conquers where he comes in every jar;
3387,62,"    yet hath he been my captive and my slave,"
3388,62,"    and begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have,"
3389,62,
3390,62,"    'over my altars hath he hung his lance,"
3391,62,"    his batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,"
3392,62,"    and for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance,"
3393,62,"    to toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest,"
3394,62,"    scorning his churlish drum and ensign red,"
3395,62,"    making my arms his field, his tent my bed,"
3396,62,
3397,62,"    'thus he that overruled i oversway'd,"
3398,62,"    leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain,"
3399,62,"    strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obey'd,"
3400,62,"    yet was he servile to my coy disdain,"
3401,62,"    o, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,"
3402,62,    for mastering her that foil'd the god of fight!
3403,62,
3404,62,"    'touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,--"
3405,62,"    though mine be not so fair, yet are they red--"
3406,62,"    the kiss shall be thine own as well as mine,"
3407,62,"    what seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head,"
3408,62,"    look in mine eye-balls, there thy beauty lies;"
3409,62,"    then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?"
3410,62,"    'art thou ashamed to kiss? then wink again,"
3411,62,    and i will wink; so shall the day seem night;
3412,62,    love keeps his revels where they are but twain;
3413,62,"    be bold to play, our sport is not in sight,"
3414,62,    these blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean
3415,62,"    never can blab, nor know not what we mean,"
3416,62,
3417,62,    'the tender spring upon thy tempting lip
3418,62,"    shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted,"
3419,62,"    make use of time, let not advantage slip;"
3420,62,"    beauty within itself should not be wasted,"
3421,62,    fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
3422,62,"    rot and consume themselves in little time,"
3423,62,
3424,62,"    'were i hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled-old,"
3425,62,"    ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,"
3426,62,"    o'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,"
3427,62,"    thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,"
3428,62,"    then mightst thou pause, for then i were not for thee"
3429,62,"    but having no defects, why dost abhor me?"
3430,62,
3431,62,    'thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow;
3432,62,"    mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning,"
3433,62,"    my beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,"
3434,62,"    my flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;"
3435,62,"    my smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,"
3436,62,"    would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt,"
3437,62,
3438,62,"    'bid me discourse, i will enchant thine ear,"
3439,62,"    or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,"
3440,62,"    or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,"
3441,62,"    dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen,"
3442,62,"    love is a spirit all compact of fire,"
3443,62,"    not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire,"
3444,62,
3445,62,    'witness this primrose bank whereon i lie;
3446,62,    these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;
3447,62,"    two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,"
3448,62,"    from morn till night, even where i list to sport me,"
3449,62,"    is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be"
3450,62,    that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?
3451,62,
3452,62,    'is thine own heart to thine own face affected?
3453,62,    can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
3454,62,"    then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,"
3455,62,"    steal thine own freedom and complain on theft,"
3456,62,"    narcissus so himself himself forsook,"
3457,62,"    and died to kiss his shadow in the brook,"
3458,62,
3459,62,"    'torches are made to light, jewels to wear,"
3460,62,"    dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,"
3461,62,"    herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear,"
3462,62,"    things growing to themselves are growth's abuse,"
3463,62,    seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty;
3464,62,"    thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty,"
3465,62,
3466,62,"    'upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,"
3467,62,    unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
3468,62,"    by law of nature thou art bound to breed,"
3469,62,    that thine may live when thou thyself art dead;
3470,62,"    and so, in spite of death, thou dost survive,"
3471,62,"    in that thy likeness still is left alive,'"
3472,62,
3473,62,"    by this the love-sick queen began to sweat,"
3474,62,"    for where they lay the shadow had forsook them,"
3475,62,"    and titan, tired in the mid-day heat,"
3476,62,    with burning eye did hotly overlook them;
3477,62,"    wishing adonis had his team to guide,"
3478,62,"    so he were like him and by venus' side,"
3479,62,
3480,62,"    and now adonis, with a lazy spright,"
3481,62,"    and with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,"
3482,62,"    his louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,"
3483,62,"    like misty vapours when they blot the sky,"
3484,62,"    souring his cheeks cries 'fie, no more of love!"
3485,62,"    the sun doth burn my face, i must remove,'"
3486,62,
3487,62,"    'ay me,' quoth venus, 'young, and so unkind?"
3488,62,    what bare excuses makest thou to be gone!
3489,62,"    i'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind"
3490,62,"    shall cool the heat of this descending sun,"
3491,62,    i'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;
3492,62,"    if they burn too, i'll quench them with my tears,"
3493,62,
3494,62,"    'the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,"
3495,62,"    and, lo, i lie between that sun and thee,"
3496,62,"    the heat i have from thence doth little harm,"
3497,62,    thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;
3498,62,"    and were i not immortal, life were done"
3499,62,"    between this heavenly and earthly sun,"
3500,62,
3501,62,"    'art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel,"
3502,62,"    nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth?"
3503,62,"    art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel"
3504,62,    what 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?
3505,62,"    o, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,"
3506,62,"    she had not brought forth thee, but died unkind,"
3507,62,
3508,62,"    'what am i, that thou shouldst contemn me this?"
3509,62,    or what great danger dwells upon my suit?
3510,62,    what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?
3511,62,"    speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute,"
3512,62,"    give me one kiss, i'll give it thee again,"
3513,62,"    and one for interest, if thou wilt have twain,"
3514,62,
3515,62,"    'fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,"
3516,62,"    well-painted idol, image dun and dead,"
3517,62,"    statue contenting but the eye alone,"
3518,62,"    thing like a man, but of no woman bred!"
3519,62,"    thou art no man, though of a man's complexion,"
3520,62,"    for men will kiss even by their own direction,'"
3521,62,
3522,62,"    this said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,"
3523,62,    and swelling passion doth provoke a pause;
3524,62,    red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong;
3525,62,"    being judge in love, she cannot right her cause,"
3526,62,"    and now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,"
3527,62,"    and now her sobs do her intendments break,"
3528,62,
3529,62,"    sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand,"
3530,62,"    now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;"
3531,62,"    sometimes her arms infold him like a band,"
3532,62,"    she would, he will not in her arms be bound;"
3533,62,"    and when from thence he struggles to be gone,"
3534,62,"    she locks her lily fingers one in one,"
3535,62,
3536,62,"    'fondling,' she saith, 'since i have hemm'd thee here"
3537,62,"    within the circuit of this ivory pale,"
3538,62,"    i'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;"
3539,62,"    feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale,"
3540,62,"    graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,"
3541,62,"    stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie,"
3542,62,
3543,62,"    within this limit is relief enough,"
3544,62,"    sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,"
3545,62,"    round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,"
3546,62,    to shelter thee from tempest and from rain
3547,62,"    then be my deer, since i am such a park;"
3548,62,"    no dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark,'"
3549,62,
3550,62,"    at this adonis smiles as in disdain,"
3551,62,"    that in each cheek appears a pretty dimple,"
3552,62,"    love made those hollows, if himself were slain,"
3553,62,    he might be buried in a tomb so simple;
3554,62,"    foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,"
3555,62,"    why, there love lived and there he could not die,"
3556,62,
3557,62,"    these lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,"
3558,62,"    open'd their mouths to swallow venus' liking,"
3559,62,"    being mad before, how doth she now for wits?"
3560,62,"    struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?"
3561,62,"    poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,"
3562,62,    to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!
3563,62,
3564,62,    now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?
3565,62,"    her words are done, her woes are more increasing;"
3566,62,"    the time is spent, her object will away,"
3567,62,"    and from her twining arms doth urge releasing,"
3568,62,"    'pity,' she cries, 'some favour, some remorse!'"
3569,62,"    away he springs and hasteth to his horse,"
3570,62,
3571,62,"    but, lo, from forth a copse that neighbors by,"
3572,62,"    a breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud,"
3573,62,"    adonis' trampling courser doth espy,"
3574,62,"    and forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud,"
3575,62,"    the strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,"
3576,62,"    breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he,"
3577,62,
3578,62,"    imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,"
3579,62,    and now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
3580,62,"    the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,"
3581,62,    whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;
3582,62,"    the iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,"
3583,62,"    controlling what he was controlled with,"
3584,62,
3585,62,    his ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
3586,62,    upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
3587,62,"    his nostrils drink the air, and forth again,"
3588,62,"    as from a furnace, vapours doth he send,"
3589,62,"    his eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,"
3590,62,"    shows his hot courage and his high desire,"
3591,62,
3592,62,"    sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,"
3593,62,    with gentle majesty and modest pride;
3594,62,"    anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,"
3595,62,"    as who should say 'lo, thus my strength is tried,"
3596,62,    and this i do to captivate the eye
3597,62,"    of the fair breeder that is standing by,'"
3598,62,
3599,62,"    what recketh he his rider's angry stir,"
3600,62,"    his flattering 'holla,' or his 'stand, i say'?"
3601,62,    what cares he now for curb or pricking spur?
3602,62,    for rich caparisons or trapping gay?
3603,62,"    he sees his love, and nothing else he sees,"
3604,62,"    for nothing else with his proud sight agrees,"
3605,62,
3606,62,"    look, when a painter would surpass the life,"
3607,62,"    in limning out a well-proportion'd steed,"
3608,62,"    his art with nature's workmanship at strife,"
3609,62,    as if the dead the living should exceed;
3610,62,    so did this horse excel a common one
3611,62,"    in shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone,"
3612,62,
3613,62,"    round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,"
3614,62,"    broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide,"
3615,62,"    high crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,"
3616,62,"    thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide,"
3617,62,"    look, what a horse should have he did not lack,"
3618,62,"    save a proud rider on so proud a back,"
3619,62,
3620,62,    sometime he scuds far off and there he stares;
3621,62,    anon he starts at stirring of a feather;
3622,62,"    to bid the wind a base he now prepares,"
3623,62,    and whether he run or fly they know not whether;
3624,62,"    for through his mane and tail the high wind sings,"
3625,62,"    fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings,"
3626,62,
3627,62,    he looks upon his love and neighs unto her;
3628,62,"    she answers him as if she knew his mind,"
3629,62,"    being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,"
3630,62,"    she puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,"
3631,62,"    spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,"
3632,62,"    beating his kind embracements with her heels,"
3633,62,
3634,62,"    then, like a melancholy malcontent,"
3635,62,"    he veils his tail that, like a falling plume,"
3636,62,"    cool shadow to his melting buttock lent,"
3637,62,"    he stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume,"
3638,62,"    his love, perceiving how he is enraged,"
3639,62,"    grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged,"
3640,62,
3641,62,    his testy master goeth about to take him;
3642,62,"    when, lo, the unback'd breeder, full of fear,"
3643,62,"    jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,"
3644,62,"    with her the horse, and left adonis there,"
3645,62,"    as they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,"
3646,62,"    out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them,"
3647,62,
3648,62,"    all swoln with chafing, down adonis sits,"
3649,62,"    banning his boisterous and unruly beast,"
3650,62,"    and now the happy season once more fits,"
3651,62,    that love-sick love by pleading may be blest;
3652,62,"    for lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong"
3653,62,"    when it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue,"
3654,62,
3655,62,"    an oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,"
3656,62,"    burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage,"
3657,62,    so of concealed sorrow may be said;
3658,62,    free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;
3659,62,"    but when the heart's attorney once is mute,"
3660,62,"    the client breaks, as desperate in his suit,"
3661,62,
3662,62,"    he sees her coming, and begins to glow,"
3663,62,"    even as a dying coal revives with wind,"
3664,62,    and with his bonnet hides his angry brow;
3665,62,"    looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,"
3666,62,"    taking no notice that she is so nigh,"
3667,62,"    for all askance he holds her in his eye,"
3668,62,
3669,62,"    o, what a sight it was, wistly to view"
3670,62,    how she came stealing to the wayward boy!
3671,62,"    to note the fighting conflict of her hue,"
3672,62,    how white and red each other did destroy!
3673,62,"    but now her cheek was pale, and by and by"
3674,62,"    it flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky,"
3675,62,
3676,62,"    now was she just before him as he sat,"
3677,62,    and like a lowly lover down she kneels;
3678,62,"    with one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,"
3679,62,"    her other tender hand his fair cheek feels,"
3680,62,"    his tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print,"
3681,62,"    as apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint,"
3682,62,
3683,62,"    o, what a war of looks was then between them!"
3684,62,    her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;
3685,62,    his eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;
3686,62,"    her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing,"
3687,62,    and all this dumb play had his acts made plain
3688,62,"    with tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain,"
3689,62,
3690,62,"    full gently now she takes him by the hand,"
3691,62,"    a lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,"
3692,62,    or ivory in an alabaster band;
3693,62,"    so white a friend engirts so white a foe,"
3694,62,"    this beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,"
3695,62,"    show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing,"
3696,62,
3697,62,"    once more the engine of her thoughts began,"
3698,62,"    'o fairest mover on this mortal round,"
3699,62,"    would thou wert as i am, and i a man,"
3700,62,"    my heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;"
3701,62,"    for one sweet look thy help i would assure thee,"
3702,62,    though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee!
3703,62,
3704,62,"    'give me my hand,' saith he, 'why dost thou feel it?'"
3705,62,"    'give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it,"
3706,62,"    o, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,"
3707,62,"    and being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it,"
3708,62,"    then love's deep groans i never shall regard,"
3709,62,"    because adonis' heart hath made mine hard,'"
3710,62,
3711,62,"    'for shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go;"
3712,62,"    my day's delight is past, my horse is gone,"
3713,62,"    and 'tis your fault i am bereft him so,"
3714,62,"    i pray you hence, and leave me here alone;"
3715,62,"    for all my mind, my thought, my busy care,"
3716,62,"    is how to get my palfrey from the mare,'"
3717,62,
3718,62,"    thus she replies, 'thy palfrey, as he should,"
3719,62,"    welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire,"
3720,62,    affection is a coal that must be cool'd;
3721,62,"    else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire,"
3722,62,"    the sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;"
3723,62,"    therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone,"
3724,62,
3725,62,"    'how like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,"
3726,62,    servilely master'd with a leathern rein!
3727,62,"    but when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,"
3728,62,    he held such petty bondage in disdain;
3729,62,"    throwing the base thong from his bending crest,"
3730,62,"    enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast,"
3731,62,
3732,62,"    'who sees his true-love in her naked bed,"
3733,62,"    teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,"
3734,62,"    but, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,"
3735,62,    his other agents aim at like delight?
3736,62,"    who is so faint, that dare not be so bold"
3737,62,"    to touch the fire, the weather being cold?"
3738,62,
3739,62,"    'let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;"
3740,62,"    and learn of him, i heartily beseech thee,"
3741,62,    to take advantage on presented joy;
3742,62,"    though i were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee;"
3743,62,"    o, learn to love; the lesson is but plain,"
3744,62,"    and once made perfect, never lost again,'"
3745,62,
3746,62,"    i know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it,"
3747,62,"    unless it be a boar, and then i chase it;"
3748,62,"    'tis much to borrow, and i will not owe it;"
3749,62,    my love to love is love but to disgrace it;
3750,62,"    for i have heard it is a life in death,"
3751,62,"    that laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath,"
3752,62,
3753,62,    'who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?
3754,62,    who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?
3755,62,"    if springing things be any jot diminish'd,"
3756,62,"    they wither in their prime, prove nothing worth,"
3757,62,    the colt that's back'd and burden'd being young
3758,62,"    loseth his pride and never waxeth strong,"
3759,62,
3760,62,"    'you hurt my hand with wringing; let us part,"
3761,62,"    and leave this idle theme, this bootless chat,"
3762,62,    remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
3763,62,"    to love's alarms it will not ope the gate,"
3764,62,"    dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery;"
3765,62,"    for where a heart is hard they make no battery,'"
3766,62,
3767,62,"    'what! canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue?"
3768,62,"    o, would thou hadst not, or i had no hearing!"
3769,62,    thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;
3770,62,"    i had my load before, now press'd with bearing,"
3771,62,"    melodious discord, heavenly tune harshsounding,"
3772,62,"    ear's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding,"
3773,62,
3774,62,"    'had i no eyes but ears, my ears would love"
3775,62,    that inward beauty and invisible;
3776,62,"    or were i deaf, thy outward parts would move"
3777,62,"    each part in me that were but sensible,"
3778,62,"    though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,"
3779,62,"    yet should i be in love by touching thee,"
3780,62,
3781,62,"    'say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,"
3782,62,"    and that i could not see, nor hear, nor touch,"
3783,62,"    and nothing but the very smell were left me,"
3784,62,    yet would my love to thee be still as much;
3785,62,    for from the stillitory of thy face excelling
3786,62,    comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by
3787,62,"    smelling,"
3788,62,
3789,62,"    'but, o, what banquet wert thou to the taste,"
3790,62,    being nurse and feeder of the other four!
3791,62,"    would they not wish the feast might ever last,"
3792,62,"    and bid suspicion double-lock the door,"
3793,62,"    lest jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,"
3794,62,"    should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'"
3795,62,
3796,62,"    once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,"
3797,62,    which to his speech did honey passage yield;
3798,62,"    like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd"
3799,62,"    wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field,"
3800,62,"    sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,"
3801,62,"    gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds,"
3802,62,
3803,62,"    this ill presage advisedly she marketh,"
3804,62,"    even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,"
3805,62,"    or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,"
3806,62,"    or as the berry breaks before it staineth,"
3807,62,"    or like the deadly bullet of a gun,"
3808,62,"    his meaning struck her ere his words begun,"
3809,62,
3810,62,"    and at his look she flatly falleth down,"
3811,62,    for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth;
3812,62,    a smile recures the wounding of a frown;
3813,62,"    but blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!"
3814,62,"    the silly boy, believing she is dead,"
3815,62,"    claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;"
3816,62,
3817,62,"    and all amazed brake off his late intent,"
3818,62,"    for sharply he did think to reprehend her,"
3819,62,"    which cunning love did wittily prevent,"
3820,62,    fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!
3821,62,"    for on the grass she lies as she were slain,"
3822,62,"    till his breath breatheth life in her again,"
3823,62,
3824,62,"    he wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,"
3825,62,"    he bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,"
3826,62,    he chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks
3827,62,"    to mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd,"
3828,62,"    he kisses her; and she, by her good will,"
3829,62,"    will never rise, so he will kiss her still,"
3830,62,
3831,62,"    the night of sorrow now is turn'd to day,"
3832,62,"    her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,"
3833,62,"    like the fair sun, when in his fresh array"
3834,62,    he cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth;
3835,62,"    and as the bright sun glorifies the sky,"
3836,62,    so is her face illumined with her eye;
3837,62,
3838,62,"    whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,"
3839,62,"    as if from thence they borrow'd all their shine,"
3840,62,"    were never four such lamps together mix'd,"
3841,62,    had not his clouded with his brow's repine;
3842,62,"    but hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,"
3843,62,"    shone like the moon in water seen by night,"
3844,62,
3845,62,"    'o, where am i?' quoth she, 'in earth or heaven,"
3846,62,"    or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire?"
3847,62,    what hour is this? or morn or weary even?
3848,62,"    do i delight to die, or life desire?"
3849,62,"    but now i lived, and life was death's annoy;"
3850,62,"    but now i died, and death was lively joy,"
3851,62,
3852,62,"    'o, thou didst kill me, kill me once again,"
3853,62,"    thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,"
3854,62,    hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
3855,62,    that they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;
3856,62,"    and these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,"
3857,62,"    but for thy piteous lips no more had seen,"
3858,62,
3859,62,"    'long may they kiss each other, for this cure!"
3860,62,"    o, never let their crimson liveries wear!"
3861,62,"    and as they last, their verdure still endure,"
3862,62,    to drive infection from the dangerous year!
3863,62,"    that the star-gazers, having writ on death,"
3864,62,"    may say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath,"
3865,62,
3866,62,"    'pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,"
3867,62,"    what bargains may i make, still to be sealing?"
3868,62,"    to sell myself i can be well contented,"
3869,62,    so thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;
3870,62,"    which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips"
3871,62,"    set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips,"
3872,62,
3873,62,    'a thousand kisses buys my heart from me;
3874,62,"    and pay them at thy leisure, one by one,"
3875,62,    what is ten hundred touches unto thee?
3876,62,    are they not quickly told and quickly gone?
3877,62,"    say, for non-payment that the debt should double,"
3878,62,    is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?
3879,62,
3880,62,"    'fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,"
3881,62,"    measure my strangeness with my unripe years,"
3882,62,"    before i know myself, seek not to know me;"
3883,62,"    no fisher but the ungrown fry forbears,"
3884,62,"    the mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,"
3885,62,"    or being early pluck'd is sour to taste,"
3886,62,
3887,62,"    'look, the world's comforter, with weary gait,"
3888,62,    his day's hot task hath ended in the west;
3889,62,"    the owl, night's herald, shrieks, ''tis very late;'"
3890,62,"    the sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,"
3891,62,    and coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light
3892,62,"    do summon us to part and bid good night,"
3893,62,
3894,62,"    'now let me say 'good night,' and so say you;"
3895,62,"    if you will say so, you shall have a kiss,'"
3896,62,"    'good night,' quoth she, and, ere he says 'adieu,'"
3897,62,"    the honey fee of parting tender'd is,"
3898,62,    her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;
3899,62,"    incorporate then they seem; face grows to face,"
3900,62,
3901,62,"    till, breathless, he disjoin'd, and backward drew"
3902,62,"    the heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,"
3903,62,"    whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,"
3904,62,"    whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth,"
3905,62,"    he with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth"
3906,62,"    their lips together glued, fall to the earth,"
3907,62,
3908,62,"    now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,"
3909,62,"    and glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;"
3910,62,"    her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,"
3911,62,    paying what ransom the insulter willeth;
3912,62,"    whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,"
3913,62,"    that she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry,"
3914,62,
3915,62,"    and having felt the sweetness of the spoil,"
3916,62,    with blindfold fury she begins to forage;
3917,62,"    her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,"
3918,62,"    and careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,"
3919,62,"    planting oblivion, beating reason back,"
3920,62,"    forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack,"
3921,62,
3922,62,"    hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,"
3923,62,"    like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling,"
3924,62,"    or as the fleet-foot roe that's tired with chasing,"
3925,62,"    or like the froward infant still'd with dandling,"
3926,62,"    he now obeys, and now no more resisteth,"
3927,62,"    while she takes all she can, not all she listeth,"
3928,62,
3929,62,"    what wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,"
3930,62,    and yields at last to every light impression?
3931,62,"    things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing,"
3932,62,"    chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission,"
3933,62,"    affection faints not like a pale-faced coward,"
3934,62,"    but then woos best when most his choice is froward,"
3935,62,
3936,62,"    when he did frown, o, had she then gave over,"
3937,62,"    such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd,"
3938,62,    foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;
3939,62,"    what though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis pluck'd,"
3940,62,"    were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,"
3941,62,"    yet love breaks through and picks them all at last,"
3942,62,
3943,62,    for pity now she can no more detain him;
3944,62,"    the poor fool prays her that he may depart,"
3945,62,    she is resolved no longer to restrain him;
3946,62,"    bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,"
3947,62,"    the which, by cupid's bow she doth protest,"
3948,62,"    he carries thence incaged in his breast,"
3949,62,
3950,62,"    'sweet boy,' she says, 'this night i'll waste in sorrow,"
3951,62,"    for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch,"
3952,62,"    tell me, love's master, shall we meet to-morrow?"
3953,62,"    say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?'"
3954,62,"    he tells her, no; to-morrow he intends"
3955,62,"    to hunt the boar with certain of his friends,"
3956,62,
3957,62,"    'the boar!' quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,"
3958,62,"    like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,"
3959,62,"    usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,"
3960,62,"    and on his neck her yoking arms she throws,"
3961,62,"    she sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,"
3962,62,"    he on her belly falls, she on her back,"
3963,62,
3964,62,"    now is she in the very lists of love,"
3965,62,"    her champion mounted for the hot encounter,"
3966,62,"    all is imaginary she doth prove,"
3967,62,"    he will not manage her, although he mount her;"
3968,62,"    that worse than tantalus' is her annoy,"
3969,62,"    to clip elysium and to lack her joy,"
3970,62,
3971,62,"    even as poor birds, deceived with painted grapes,"
3972,62,"    do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,"
3973,62,"    even so she languisheth in her mishaps,"
3974,62,"    as those poor birds that helpless berries saw,"
3975,62,    the warm effects which she in him finds missing
3976,62,"    she seeks to kindle with continual kissing,"
3977,62,
3978,62,"    but all in vain; good queen, it will not be,"
3979,62,    she hath assay'd as much as may be proved;
3980,62,    her pleading hath deserved a greater fee;
3981,62,"    she's love, she loves, and yet she is not loved,"
3982,62,"    'fie, fie,' he says, 'you crush me; let me go;"
3983,62,"    you have no reason to withhold me so,'"
3984,62,
3985,62,"    'thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this,"
3986,62,"    but that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar,"
3987,62,"    o, be advised! thou know'st not what it is"
3988,62,"    with javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,"
3989,62,"    whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still,"
3990,62,"    like to a mortal butcher bent to kill,"
3991,62,
3992,62,    'on his bow-back he hath a battle set
3993,62,"    of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;"
3994,62,"    his eyes, like glow-worms, shine when he doth fret;"
3995,62,    his snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
3996,62,"    being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way,"
3997,62,"    and whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay,"
3998,62,
3999,62,"    'his brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm'd,"
4000,62,    are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;
4001,62,    his short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;
4002,62,"    being ireful, on the lion he will venture,"
4003,62,"    the thorny brambles and embracing bushes,"
4004,62,"    as fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes,"
4005,62,
4006,62,"    'alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,"
4007,62,    to which love's eyes pay tributary gazes;
4008,62,"    nor thy soft hands, sweet lips and crystal eyne,"
4009,62,    whose full perfection all the world amazes;
4010,62,"    but having thee at vantage,--wondrous dread!--"
4011,62,"    would root these beauties as he roots the mead,"
4012,62,
4013,62,"    'o, let him keep his loathsome cabin still;"
4014,62,"    beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends,"
4015,62,    come not within his danger by thy will;
4016,62,"    they that thrive well take counsel of their friends,"
4017,62,"    when thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,"
4018,62,"    i fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble,"
4019,62,
4020,62,    'didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?
4021,62,    saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?
4022,62,    grew i not faint? and fell i not downright?
4023,62,"    within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,"
4024,62,"    my boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,"
4025,62,"    but, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast,"
4026,62,
4027,62,"    'for where love reigns, disturbing jealousy"
4028,62,    doth call himself affection's sentinel;
4029,62,"    gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,"
4030,62,"    and in a peaceful hour doth cry 'kill, kill!'"
4031,62,"    distempering gentle love in his desire,"
4032,62,"    as air and water do abate the fire,"
4033,62,
4034,62,"    'this sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,"
4035,62,"    this canker that eats up love's tender spring,"
4036,62,"    this carry-tale, dissentious jealousy,"
4037,62,"    that sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,"
4038,62,    knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
4039,62,"    that if i love thee, i thy death should fear,"
4040,62,
4041,62,"    'and more than so, presenteth to mine eye"
4042,62,"    the picture of an angry-chafing boar,"
4043,62,    under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
4044,62,"    an image like thyself, all stain'd with gore;"
4045,62,    whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
4046,62,"    doth make them droop with grief and hang the head,"
4047,62,
4048,62,"    'what should i do, seeing thee so indeed,"
4049,62,    that tremble at the imagination?
4050,62,"    the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,"
4051,62,"    and fear doth teach it divination,"
4052,62,"    i prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,"
4053,62,"    if thou encounter with the boar to-morrow,"
4054,62,
4055,62,"    'but if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me;"
4056,62,"    uncouple at the timorous flying hare,"
4057,62,"    or at the fox which lives by subtlety,"
4058,62,"    or at the roe which no encounter dare,"
4059,62,"    pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,"
4060,62,    and on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy
4061,62,"    hounds,"
4062,62,
4063,62,"    'and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,"
4064,62,"    mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles"
4065,62,    how he outruns the wind and with what care
4066,62,"    he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles,"
4067,62,    the many musets through the which he goes
4068,62,"    are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes,"
4069,62,
4070,62,"    'sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,"
4071,62,"    to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,"
4072,62,"    and sometime where earth-delving conies keep,"
4073,62,"    to stop the loud pursuers in their yell,"
4074,62,"    and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer,"
4075,62,"    danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear,"
4076,62,
4077,62,"    'for there his smell with others being mingled,"
4078,62,"    the hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,"
4079,62,    ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
4080,62,    with much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
4081,62,"    then do they spend their mouths, echo replies,"
4082,62,"    as if another chase were in the skies,"
4083,62,
4084,62,"    'by this, poor wat, far off upon a hill,"
4085,62,"    stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,"
4086,62,"    to harken if his foes pursue him still,"
4087,62,    anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
4088,62,    and now his grief may be compared well
4089,62,"    to one sore sick that hears the passing-bell,"
4090,62,
4091,62,    'then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch
4092,62,"    turn, and return, indenting with the way;"
4093,62,"    each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch,"
4094,62,"    each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay,"
4095,62,"    for misery is trodden on by many,"
4096,62,"    and being low never relieved by any,"
4097,62,
4098,62,"    'lie quietly, and hear a little more;"
4099,62,"    nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise,"
4100,62,"    to make thee hate the hunting of the boar,"
4101,62,"    unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,"
4102,62,"    applying this to that, and so to so;"
4103,62,"    for love can comment upon every woe,"
4104,62,
4105,62,"    'where did i leave?' 'no matter where,' quoth he,"
4106,62,"    'leave me, and then the story aptly ends,"
4107,62,"    the night is spent,' 'why, what of that?' quoth she,"
4108,62,"    'i am,' quoth he, 'expected of my friends;"
4109,62,"    and now 'tis dark, and going i shall fall,'"
4110,62,"    'in night,' quoth she, 'desire sees best of all"
4111,62,
4112,62,"    'but if thou fall, o, then imagine this,"
4113,62,"    the earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,"
4114,62,"    and all is but to rob thee of a kiss,"
4115,62,    rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
4116,62,"    make modest dian cloudy and forlorn,"
4117,62,"    lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn,"
4118,62,
4119,62,"    'now of this dark night i perceive the reason,"
4120,62,"    cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine,"
4121,62,"    till forging nature be condemn'd of treason,"
4122,62,    for stealing moulds from heaven that were divine;
4123,62,"    wherein she framed thee in high heaven's despite,"
4124,62,"    to shame the sun by day and her by night,"
4125,62,
4126,62,    'and therefore hath she bribed the destinies
4127,62,"    to cross the curious workmanship of nature,"
4128,62,"    to mingle beauty with infirmities,"
4129,62,"    and pure perfection with impure defeature,"
4130,62,    making it subject to the tyranny
4131,62,    of mad mischances and much misery;
4132,62,
4133,62,"    'as burning fevers, agues pale and faint,"
4134,62,"    life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,"
4135,62,"    the marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint"
4136,62,"    disorder breeds by heating of the blood,"
4137,62,"    surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair,"
4138,62,"    swear nature's death for framing thee so fair,"
4139,62,
4140,62,    'and not the least of all these maladies
4141,62,"    but in one minute's fight brings beauty under,"
4142,62,"    both favour, savour, hue and qualities,"
4143,62,"    whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder,"
4144,62,"    are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done,"
4145,62,"    as mountain-snow melts with the midday sun,"
4146,62,
4147,62,"    'therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,"
4148,62,"    love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,"
4149,62,    that on the earth would breed a scarcity
4150,62,"    and barren dearth of daughters and of sons,"
4151,62,"    be prodigal, the lamp that burns by night"
4152,62,"    dries up his oil to lend the world his light,"
4153,62,
4154,62,"    'what is thy body but a swallowing grave,"
4155,62,    seeming to bury that posterity
4156,62,"    which by the rights of time thou needs must have,"
4157,62,    if thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?
4158,62,"    if so, the world will hold thee in disdain,"
4159,62,"    sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain,"
4160,62,
4161,62,    'so in thyself thyself art made away;
4162,62,"    a mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,"
4163,62,"    or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,"
4164,62,"    or butcher-sire that reaves his son of life,"
4165,62,"    foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,"
4166,62,"    but gold that's put to use more gold begets,'"
4167,62,
4168,62,"    'nay, then,' quoth adon, 'you will fall again"
4169,62,"    into your idle over-handled theme,"
4170,62,"    the kiss i gave you is bestow'd in vain,"
4171,62,    and all in vain you strive against the stream;
4172,62,"    for, by this black-faced night, desire's foul nurse,"
4173,62,"    your treatise makes me like you worse and worse,"
4174,62,
4175,62,"    'if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,"
4176,62,"    and every tongue more moving than your own,"
4177,62,"    bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,"
4178,62,    yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
4179,62,"    for know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,"
4180,62,    and will not let a false sound enter there;
4181,62,
4182,62,    'lest the deceiving harmony should run
4183,62,    into the quiet closure of my breast;
4184,62,"    and then my little heart were quite undone,"
4185,62,"    in his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest,"
4186,62,"    no, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,"
4187,62,"    but soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone,"
4188,62,
4189,62,    'what have you urged that i cannot reprove?
4190,62,"    the path is smooth that leadeth on to danger,"
4191,62,"    i hate not love, but your device in love,"
4192,62,"    that lends embracements unto every stranger,"
4193,62,"    you do it for increase, o strange excuse,"
4194,62,    when reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!
4195,62,
4196,62,"    'call it not love, for love to heaven is fled,"
4197,62,    since sweating lust on earth usurp'd his name;
4198,62,    under whose simple semblance he hath fed
4199,62,"    upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;"
4200,62,"    which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,"
4201,62,"    as caterpillars do the tender leaves,"
4202,62,
4203,62,"    'love comforteth like sunshine after rain,"
4204,62,    but lust's effect is tempest after sun;
4205,62,"    love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,"
4206,62,    lust's winter comes ere summer half be done;
4207,62,"    love surfeits not, lust like a glutton dies;"
4208,62,"    love is all truth, lust full of forged lies,"
4209,62,
4210,62,"    'more i could tell, but more i dare not say;"
4211,62,"    the text is old, the orator too green,"
4212,62,"    therefore, in sadness, now i will away;"
4213,62,"    my face is full of shame, my heart of teen,"
4214,62,"    mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,"
4215,62,"    do burn themselves for having so offended,'"
4216,62,
4217,62,"    with this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace,"
4218,62,"    of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,"
4219,62,    and homeward through the dark laund runs apace;
4220,62,"    leaves love upon her back deeply distress'd,"
4221,62,"    look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky,"
4222,62,"    so glides he in the night from venus' eye,"
4223,62,
4224,62,"    which after him she darts, as one on shore"
4225,62,"    gazing upon a late-embarked friend,"
4226,62,"    till the wild waves will have him seen no more,"
4227,62,"    whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend,"
4228,62,    so did the merciless and pitchy night
4229,62,"    fold in the object that did feed her sight,"
4230,62,
4231,62,"    whereat amazed, as one that unaware"
4232,62,"    hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,"
4233,62,"    or stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,"
4234,62,"    their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,"
4235,62,"    even so confounded in the dark she lay,"
4236,62,"    having lost the fair discovery of her way,"
4237,62,
4238,62,"    and now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,"
4239,62,"    that all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,"
4240,62,    make verbal repetition of her moans;
4241,62,"    passion on passion deeply is redoubled,"
4242,62,"    'ay me!' she cries, and twenty times 'woe, woe!'"
4243,62,"    and twenty echoes twenty times cry so,"
4244,62,
4245,62,    she marking them begins a wailing note
4246,62,    and sings extemporally a woeful ditty;
4247,62,    how love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
4248,62,"    how love is wise in folly, foolish-witty,"
4249,62,"    her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,"
4250,62,"    and still the choir of echoes answer so,"
4251,62,
4252,62,"    her song was tedious and outwore the night,"
4253,62,"    for lovers' hours are long, though seeming short,"
4254,62,"    if pleased themselves, others, they think, delight"
4255,62,"    in such-like circumstance, with suchlike sport,"
4256,62,    their copious stories oftentimes begun
4257,62,"    end without audience and are never done,"
4258,62,
4259,62,    for who hath she to spend the night withal
4260,62,"    but idle sounds resembling parasites,"
4261,62,"    like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call,"
4262,62,    soothing the humour of fantastic wits?
4263,62,"    she says ''tis so,' they answer all ''tis so;'"
4264,62,"    and would say after her, if she said 'no,'"
4265,62,
4266,62,"    lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,"
4267,62,"    from his moist cabinet mounts up on high,"
4268,62,"    and wakes the morning, from whose silver breast"
4269,62,    the sun ariseth in his majesty;
4270,62,    who doth the world so gloriously behold
4271,62,"    that cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold,"
4272,62,
4273,62,"    venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow,"
4274,62,"    'o thou clear god, and patron of all light,"
4275,62,    from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
4276,62,"    the beauteous influence that makes him bright,"
4277,62,"    there lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,"
4278,62,"    may lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other,'"
4279,62,
4280,62,"    this said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,"
4281,62,"    musing the morning is so much o'erworn,"
4282,62,"    and yet she hears no tidings of her love,"
4283,62,"    she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn,"
4284,62,"    anon she hears them chant it lustily,"
4285,62,"    and all in haste she coasteth to the cry,"
4286,62,
4287,62,"    and as she runs, the bushes in the way"
4288,62,"    some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,"
4289,62,"    some twine about her thigh to make her stay,"
4290,62,"    she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,"
4291,62,"    like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,"
4292,62,"    hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake,"
4293,62,
4294,62,"    by this, she hears the hounds are at a bay;"
4295,62,"    whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder"
4296,62,"    wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way,"
4297,62,    the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;
4298,62,    even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
4299,62,"    appals her senses and her spirit confounds,"
4300,62,
4301,62,"    for now she knows it is no gentle chase,"
4302,62,"    but the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,"
4303,62,"    because the cry remaineth in one place,"
4304,62,"    where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud,"
4305,62,"    finding their enemy to be so curst,"
4306,62,"    they all strain courtesy who shall cope him first,"
4307,62,
4308,62,"    this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,"
4309,62,    through which it enters to surprise her heart;
4310,62,"    who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,"
4311,62,"    with cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part,"
4312,62,"    like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,"
4313,62,"    they basely fly and dare not stay the field,"
4314,62,
4315,62,    thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy;
4316,62,"    till, cheering up her senses all dismay'd,"
4317,62,"    she tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,"
4318,62,"    and childish error, that they are afraid;"
4319,62,"    bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more,--"
4320,62,"    and with that word she spied the hunted boar,"
4321,62,
4322,62,"    whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red,"
4323,62,"    like milk and blood being mingled both together,"
4324,62,"    a second fear through all her sinews spread,"
4325,62,"    which madly hurries her she knows not whither,"
4326,62,"    this way runs, and now she will no further,"
4327,62,"    but back retires to rate the boar for murther,"
4328,62,
4329,62,    a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways;
4330,62,    she treads the path that she untreads again;
4331,62,"    her more than haste is mated with delays,"
4332,62,"    like the proceedings of a drunken brain,"
4333,62,"    full of respects, yet nought at all respecting;"
4334,62,"    in hand with all things, nought at all effecting,"
4335,62,
4336,62,"    here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound,"
4337,62,"    and asks the weary caitiff for his master,"
4338,62,"    and there another licking of his wound,"
4339,62,    'gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;
4340,62,"    and here she meets another sadly scowling,"
4341,62,"    to whom she speaks, and he replies with howling,"
4342,62,
4343,62,"    when he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,"
4344,62,"    another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,"
4345,62,    against the welkin volleys out his voice;
4346,62,"    another and another answer him,"
4347,62,"    clapping their proud tails to the ground below,"
4348,62,"    shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go,"
4349,62,
4350,62,"    look, how the world's poor people are amazed"
4351,62,"    at apparitions, signs and prodigies,"
4352,62,"    whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,"
4353,62,    infusing them with dreadful prophecies;
4354,62,    so she at these sad signs draws up her breath
4355,62,"    and sighing it again, exclaims on death,"
4356,62,
4357,62,"    'hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,"
4358,62,"    hateful divorce of love,'--thus chides she death,--"
4359,62,"    'grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean"
4360,62,"    to stifle beauty and to steal his breath,"
4361,62,"    who when he lived, his breath and beauty set"
4362,62,"    gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?"
4363,62,
4364,62,"    'if he be dead,--o no, it cannot be,"
4365,62,"    seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it,--"
4366,62,"    o yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,"
4367,62,"    but hatefully at random dost thou hit,"
4368,62,"    thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart"
4369,62,"    mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart,"
4370,62,
4371,62,"    'hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,"
4372,62,"    and, hearing him, thy power had lost his power,"
4373,62,    the destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
4374,62,"    they bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower,"
4375,62,"    love's golden arrow at him should have fled,"
4376,62,"    and not death's ebon dart, to strike dead,"
4377,62,
4378,62,"    'dost thou drink tears, that thou provokest such weeping?"
4379,62,    what may a heavy groan advantage thee?
4380,62,    why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
4381,62,    those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?
4382,62,"    now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,"
4383,62,"    since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour,'"
4384,62,
4385,62,"    here overcome, as one full of despair,"
4386,62,"    she vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopt"
4387,62,    the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
4388,62,    in the sweet channel of her bosom dropt;
4389,62,"    but through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,"
4390,62,"    and with his strong course opens them again,"
4391,62,
4392,62,"    o, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!"
4393,62,"    her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;"
4394,62,"    both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,"
4395,62,    sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;
4396,62,"    but like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,"
4397,62,"    sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again,"
4398,62,
4399,62,"    variable passions throng her constant woe,"
4400,62,    as striving who should best become her grief;
4401,62,"    all entertain'd, each passion labours so,"
4402,62,"    that every present sorrow seemeth chief,"
4403,62,"    but none is best, then join they all together,"
4404,62,"    like many clouds consulting for foul weather,"
4405,62,
4406,62,"    by this, far off she hears some huntsman hollo;"
4407,62,"    a nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well,"
4408,62,    the dire imagination she did follow
4409,62,    this sound of hope doth labour to expel;
4410,62,"    for now reviving joy bids her rejoice,"
4411,62,"    and flatters her it is adonis' voice,"
4412,62,
4413,62,"    whereat her tears began to turn their tide,"
4414,62,    being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass;
4415,62,"    yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,"
4416,62,"    which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass,"
4417,62,"    to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,"
4418,62,"    who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd,"
4419,62,
4420,62,"    o hard-believing love, how strange it seems"
4421,62,"    not to believe, and yet too credulous!"
4422,62,    thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;
4423,62,"    despair and hope makes thee ridiculous,"
4424,62,"    the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,"
4425,62,"    in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly,"
4426,62,
4427,62,    now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
4428,62,"    adonis lives, and death is not to blame;"
4429,62,"    it was not she that call'd him, all-to naught,"
4430,62,    now she adds honours to his hateful name;
4431,62,"    she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,"
4432,62,"    imperious supreme of all mortal things,"
4433,62,
4434,62,"    'no, no,' quoth she, 'sweet death, i did but jest;"
4435,62,    yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear
4436,62,"    when as i met the boar, that bloody beast,"
4437,62,"    which knows no pity, but is still severe;"
4438,62,"    then, gentle shadow,--truth i must confess,--"
4439,62,"    i rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease,"
4440,62,
4441,62,"    ''tis not my fault, the boar provoked my tongue;"
4442,62,"    be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;"
4443,62,"    'tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;"
4444,62,"    i did but act, he's author of thy slander,"
4445,62,"    grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet"
4446,62,"    could rule them both without ten women's wit,'"
4447,62,
4448,62,"    thus hoping that adonis is alive,"
4449,62,    her rash suspect she doth extenuate;
4450,62,"    and that his beauty may the better thrive,"
4451,62,    with death she humbly doth insinuate;
4452,62,"    tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories"
4453,62,"    his victories, his triumphs and his glories,"
4454,62,
4455,62,"    'o jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was i"
4456,62,    to be of such a weak and silly mind
4457,62,    to wail his death who lives and must not die
4458,62,    till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!
4459,62,"    for he being dead, with him is beauty slain,"
4460,62,"    and, beauty dead, black chaos comes again,"
4461,62,
4462,62,"    'fie, fie, fond love, thou art so full of fear"
4463,62,"    as one with treasure laden, hemm'd thieves;"
4464,62,"    trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,"
4465,62,"    thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves,'"
4466,62,"    even at this word she hears a merry horn,"
4467,62,"    whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn,"
4468,62,
4469,62,"    as falcon to the lure, away she flies;"
4470,62,"    the grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;"
4471,62,    and in her haste unfortunately spies
4472,62,    the foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;
4473,62,"    which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,"
4474,62,"    like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;"
4475,62,
4476,62,"    or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,"
4477,62,"    shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,"
4478,62,"    and there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,"
4479,62,    long after fearing to creep forth again;
4480,62,"    so, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled"
4481,62,"    into the deep dark cabins of her head,"
4482,62,
4483,62,    where they resign their office and their light
4484,62,    to the disposing of her troubled brain;
4485,62,"    who bids them still consort with ugly night,"
4486,62,    and never wound the heart with looks again;
4487,62,"    who like a king perplexed in his throne,"
4488,62,"    by their suggestion gives a deadly groan,"
4489,62,
4490,62,    whereat each tributary subject quakes;
4491,62,"    as when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,"
4492,62,"    struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,"
4493,62,"    which with cold terror doth men's minds confound,"
4494,62,    this mutiny each part doth so surprise
4495,62,    that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;
4496,62,
4497,62,"    and, being open'd, threw unwilling light"
4498,62,    upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd
4499,62,    in his soft flank; whose wonted lily white
4500,62,"    with purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd,"
4501,62,"    no flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,"
4502,62,"    but stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed,"
4503,62,
4504,62,    this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth;
4505,62,    over one shoulder doth she hang her head;
4506,62,"    dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;"
4507,62,"    she thinks he could not die, he is not dead,"
4508,62,"    her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;"
4509,62,"    her eyes are mad that they have wept til now,"
4510,62,
4511,62,"    upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,"
4512,62,    that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;
4513,62,"    and then she reprehends her mangling eye,"
4514,62,"    that makes more gashes where no breach should be,"
4515,62,"    his face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;"
4516,62,"    for oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled,"
4517,62,
4518,62,"    'my tongue cannot express my grief for one,"
4519,62,"    and yet,' quoth she, 'behold two adons dead!"
4520,62,"    my sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,"
4521,62,"    mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead,"
4522,62,"    heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!"
4523,62,"    so shall i die by drops of hot desire,"
4524,62,
4525,62,"    'alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!"
4526,62,    what face remains alive that's worth the viewing?
4527,62,    whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast
4528,62,"    of things long since, or any thing ensuing?"
4529,62,"    the flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;"
4530,62,"    but true-sweet beauty lived and died with him,"
4531,62,
4532,62,    'bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!
4533,62,"    nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you,"
4534,62,"    having no fair to lose, you need not fear;"
4535,62,"    the sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you,"
4536,62,"    but when adonis lived, sun and sharp air"
4537,62,"    lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair,"
4538,62,
4539,62,"    'and therefore would he put his bonnet on,"
4540,62,    under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
4541,62,"    the wind would blow it off and, being gone,"
4542,62,"    play with his locks, then would adonis weep;"
4543,62,"    and straight, in pity of his tender years,"
4544,62,"    they both would strive who first should dry his tears,"
4545,62,
4546,62,    'to see his face the lion walk'd along
4547,62,"    behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;"
4548,62,"    to recreate himself when he hath sung,"
4549,62,    the tiger would be tame and gently hear him;
4550,62,"    if he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey"
4551,62,"    and never fright the silly lamb that day,"
4552,62,
4553,62,"    'when he beheld his shadow in the brook,"
4554,62,    the fishes spread on it their golden gills;
4555,62,"    when he was by, the birds such pleasure took,"
4556,62,"    that some would sing, some other in their bills"
4557,62,    would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries;
4558,62,"    he fed them with his sight, they him with berries,"
4559,62,
4560,62,"    'but this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,"
4561,62,"    whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,"
4562,62,    ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;
4563,62,"    witness the entertainment that he gave,"
4564,62,"    if he did see his face, why then i know"
4565,62,"    he thought to kiss him, and hath kill'd him so,"
4566,62,
4567,62,"    ''tis true, 'tis true; thus was adonis slain,"
4568,62,"    he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,"
4569,62,"    who did not whet his teeth at him again,"
4570,62,    but by a kiss thought to persuade him there;
4571,62,"    and nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine"
4572,62,"    sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin,"
4573,62,
4574,62,"    'had i been tooth'd like him, i must confess,"
4575,62,    with kissing him i should have kill'd him first;
4576,62,"    but he is dead, and never did he bless"
4577,62,"    my youth with his; the more am i accurst,'"
4578,62,"    with this, she falleth in the place she stood,"
4579,62,"    and stains her face with his congealed blood,"
4580,62,
4581,62,"    she looks upon his lips, and they are pale;"
4582,62,"    she takes him by the hand, and that is cold;"
4583,62,"    she whispers in his ears a heavy tale,"
4584,62,    as if they heard the woeful words she told;
4585,62,"    she lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,"
4586,62,"    where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;"
4587,62,
4588,62,"    two glasses, where herself herself beheld"
4589,62,"    a thousand times, and now no more reflect;"
4590,62,"    their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,"
4591,62,"    and every beauty robb'd of his effect,"
4592,62,"    'wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite,"
4593,62,"    that, thou being dead, the day should yet be light,"
4594,62,
4595,62,"    'since thou art dead, lo, here i prophesy,"
4596,62,"    sorrow on love hereafter shall attend,"
4597,62,"    it shall be waited on with jealousy,"
4598,62,"    find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end,"
4599,62,"    ne'er settled equally, but high or low,"
4600,62,"    that all love's pleasure shall not match his woe,"
4601,62,
4602,62,"    'it shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,"
4603,62,    bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;
4604,62,"    the bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd"
4605,62,"    with sweets that shall the truest sight beguile,"
4606,62,"    the strongest body shall it make most weak,"
4607,62,"    strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak,"
4608,62,
4609,62,"    'it shall be sparing and too full of riot,"
4610,62,    teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;
4611,62,"    the staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,"
4612,62,"    pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;"
4613,62,"    it shall be raging-mad and silly-mild,"
4614,62,"    make the young old, the old become a child,"
4615,62,
4616,62,    'it shall suspect where is no cause of fear;
4617,62,    it shall not fear where it should most mistrust;
4618,62,"    it shall be merciful and too severe,"
4619,62,    and most deceiving when it seems most just;
4620,62,"    perverse it shall be where it shows most toward,"
4621,62,"    put fear to valour, courage to the coward,"
4622,62,
4623,62,"    'it shall be cause of war and dire events,"
4624,62,    and set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;
4625,62,"    subject and servile to all discontents,"
4626,62,"    as dry combustious matter is to fire,"
4627,62,"    sith in his prime death doth my love destroy,"
4628,62,"    they that love best their loves shall not enjoy,'"
4629,62,
4630,62,"    by this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd"
4631,62,"    was melted like a vapour from her sight,"
4632,62,"    and in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,"
4633,62,"    a purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white,"
4634,62,    resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
4635,62,"    which in round drops upon their whiteness stood,"
4636,62,
4637,62,"    she bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,"
4638,62,"    comparing it to her adonis' breath,"
4639,62,"    and says, within her bosom it shall dwell,"
4640,62,"    since he himself is reft from her by death,"
4641,62,"    she crops the stalk, and in the breach appears"
4642,62,"    green dropping sap, which she compares to tears,"
4643,62,
4644,62,"    'poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy fathers guise--"
4645,62,    sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire--
4646,62,"    for every little grief to wet his eyes,"
4647,62,"    to grow unto himself was his desire,"
4648,62,"    and so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good"
4649,62,"    to wither in my breast as in his blood,"
4650,62,
4651,62,"    'here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;"
4652,62,"    thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right,"
4653,62,"    lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest,"
4654,62,"    my throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night,"
4655,62,    there shall not be one minute in an hour
4656,62,"    wherein i will not kiss my sweet love's flower,'"
4657,62,
4658,62,"    thus weary of the world, away she hies,"
4659,62,    and yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid
4660,62,    their mistress mounted through the empty skies
4661,62,    in her light chariot quickly is convey'd;
4662,62,"    holding their course to paphos, where their queen"
4663,62,"    means to immure herself and not be seen,"
4664,63,"lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,"
4665,63,"  from his moist cabinet mounts up on high,"
4666,63,"  and wakes the morning, from whose silver breast"
4667,63,  the sun ariseth in his majesty;
4668,63,    who doth the world so gloriously behold
4669,63,"    that cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold,"
4670,63,
4671,63,   venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow;
4672,63,"  o thou clear god, and patron of all light,"
4673,63,  from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
4674,63,"  the beauteous influence that makes him bright,"
4675,63,"    there lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,"
4676,63,"    may lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other,"
4677,63,
4678,63,"   this said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,"
4679,63,"  musing the morning is so much o'erworn,"
4680,63,"  and yet she hears no tidings of her love,"
4681,63,"  she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn,"
4682,63,"    anon she hears them chant it lustily,"
4683,63,"    and all in haste she coasteth to the cry,"
4684,63,
4685,63,"   and as she runs, the bushes in the way"
4686,63,"  some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,"
4687,63,"  some twine about her thigh to make her stay,"
4688,63,"  she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,"
4689,63,"    like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,"
4690,63,"    hasting to feed her fawn, hid in some brake,"
4691,63,
4692,63,   by this she hears the hounds are at a bay;
4693,63,"  whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder"
4694,63,"  wreath'd up in fatal folds just in his way,"
4695,63,  the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;
4696,63,    even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
4697,63,"    appals her senses and her spirit confounds,"
4698,63,
4699,63,"   for now she knows it is no gentle chase,"
4700,63,"  but the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,"
4701,63,"  because the cry remaineth in one place,"
4702,63,"  where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud,"
4703,63,"    finding their enemy to be so curst,"
4704,63,"    they all strain court'sy who shall cope him first,"
4705,63,
4706,63,"   this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,"
4707,63,  through which it enters to surprise her heart;
4708,63,"  who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,"
4709,63,"  with cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part,"
4710,63,"    like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,"
4711,63,"    they basely fly and dare not stay the field,"
4712,63,
4713,63,   thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy;
4714,63,"  till, cheering up her senses all dismay'd,"
4715,63,"  she tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,"
4716,63,"  and childish error, that they are afraid;"
4717,63,"    bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more,--"
4718,63,    and with that word she spied the hunted boar;
4719,63,
4720,63,"   whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red,"
4721,63,"  like milk and blood being mingled both together,"
4722,63,"  a second fear through all her sinews spread,"
4723,63,"  which madly hurries her she knows not whither,"
4724,63,"    this way she runs, and now she will no further,"
4725,63,"    but back retires to rate the boar for murther,"
4726,63,
4727,63,   a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways;
4728,63,  she treads the path that she untreads again;
4729,63,"  her more than haste is mated with delays,"
4730,63,"  like the proceedings of a drunken brain,"
4731,63,"    full of respects, yet nought at all respecting;"
4732,63,"    in hand with all things, nought at all effecting,"
4733,63,
4734,63,"   here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound,"
4735,63,"  and asks the weary caitiff for his master,"
4736,63,"  and there another licking of his wound,"
4737,63,  'gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;
4738,63,"    and here she meets another sadly scowling,"
4739,63,"    to whom she speaks, and he replies with howling,"
4740,63,
4741,63,"   when he hath ceas'd his ill-resounding noise,"
4742,63,"  another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,"
4743,63,  against the welkin volleys out his voice;
4744,63,"  another, and another, answer him,"
4745,63,"    clapping their proud tails to the ground below,"
4746,63,"    shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go,"
4747,63,
4748,63,"   look, how the world's poor people are amazed"
4749,63,"  at apparitions, signs, and prodigies,"
4750,63,"  whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,"
4751,63,  infusing them with dreadful prophecies;
4752,63,    so she at these sad signs draws up her breath
4753,63,"    and sighing it again, exclaims on death,"
4754,63,
4755,63,"   hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,"
4756,63,"  hateful divorce of love,--thus chides she death,--"
4757,63,"  grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean"
4758,63,"  to stifle beauty and to steal his breath,"
4759,63,"    who when he liv'd, his breath and beauty set"
4760,63,"    gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?"
4761,63,
4762,63,"   if he be dead,--o no, it cannot be,"
4763,63,"  seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it,--"
4764,63,"  o yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,"
4765,63,"  but hatefully at random dost thou hit,"
4766,63,"    thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart"
4767,63,"    mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart,"
4768,63,
4769,63,"   hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,"
4770,63,"  and, hearing him, thy power had lost his power,"
4771,63,  the destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
4772,63,"  they bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower,"
4773,63,"    love's golden arrow at him should have fled,"
4774,63,"    and not death's ebon dart, to strike him dead,"
4775,63,
4776,63,"   dost thou drink tears, that thou provok'st such weeping?"
4777,63,  what may a heavy groan advantage thee?
4778,63,  why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
4779,63,  those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?
4780,63,"    now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,"
4781,63,"    since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour,"
4782,63,
4783,63,"   here overcome, as one full of despair,"
4784,63,"  she vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopt"
4785,63,  the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
4786,63,  in the sweet channel of her bosom dropt;
4787,63,"    but through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,"
4788,63,"    and with his strong course opens them again,"
4789,63,
4790,63,"   o, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!"
4791,63,"  her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;"
4792,63,"  both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,"
4793,63,  sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;
4794,63,"    but like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,"
4795,63,"    sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again,"
4796,63,
4797,63,"   variable passions throng her constant woe,"
4798,63,  as striving who should best become her grief;
4799,63,"  all entertain'd, each passion labours so,"
4800,63,"  that every present sorrow seemeth chief,"
4801,63,"    but none is best, then join they all together,"
4802,63,"    like many clouds consulting for foul weather,"
4803,63,
4804,63,"   by this, far off she hears some huntsman hollo;"
4805,63,"  a nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well,"
4806,63,  the dire imagination she did follow
4807,63,  this sound of hope doth labour to expel;
4808,63,"    for now reviving joy bids her rejoice,"
4809,63,"    and flatters her it is adonis' voice,"
4810,63,
4811,63,"   whereat her tears began to turn their tide,"
4812,63,  being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass;
4813,63,"  yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,"
4814,63,"  which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass,"
4815,63,"    to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,"
4816,63,"    who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd,"
4817,63,
4818,63,"   o hard-believing love, how strange it seems"
4819,63,"  not to believe, and yet too credulous!"
4820,63,  thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;
4821,63,"  despair and hope make thee ridiculous,"
4822,63,"    the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,"
4823,63,"    in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly,"
4824,63,
4825,63,   now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
4826,63,"  adonis lives, and death is not to blame;"
4827,63,"  it was not she that call'd him all to naught,"
4828,63,  now she adds honours to his hateful name;
4829,63,"    she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,"
4830,63,"    imperious supreme of all mortal things,"
4831,63,
4832,63,"   no, no, quoth she, sweet death, i did but jest;"
4833,63,  yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear
4834,63,"  when as i met the boar, that bloody beast,"
4835,63,"  which knows no pity, but is still severe;"
4836,63,"    then, gentle shadow,--truth i must confess,--"
4837,63,"    i rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease,"
4838,63,
4839,63,"   'tis not my fault, the boar provok'd my tongue;"
4840,63,"  be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;"
4841,63,"  'tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;"
4842,63,"  i did but act, he's author of thy slander,"
4843,63,"    grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet"
4844,63,"    could rule them both without ten women's wit,"
4845,63,
4846,63,"   thus hoping that adonis is alive,"
4847,63,  her rash suspect she doth extenuate;
4848,63,"  and that his beauty may the better thrive,"
4849,63,  with death she humbly doth insinuate;
4850,63,"    tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories"
4851,63,"    his victories, his triumphs and his glories,"
4852,63,
4853,63,"   o jove, quoth she, how much a fool was i"
4854,63,  to be of such a weak and silly mind
4855,63,  to wail his death who lives and must not die
4856,63,  till mutual overthrow of mortal kind;
4857,63,"    for he being dead, with him is beauty slain,"
4858,63,"    and, beauty dead, black chaos comes again,"
4859,63,
4860,63,"   fie, fie, fond love, thou art so full of fear"
4861,63,"  as one with treasure laden, hemm'd with thieves;"
4862,63,"  trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,"
4863,63,"  thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves,"
4864,63,"    even at this word she hears a merry horn,"
4865,63,"    whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn,"
4866,63,
4867,63,"   as falcon to the lure, away she flies;"
4868,63,"  the grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;"
4869,63,  and in her haste unfortunately spies
4870,63,  the foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;
4871,63,"    which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,"
4872,63,"    like stars asham'd of day, themselves withdrew;"
4873,63,
4874,63,"   or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,"
4875,63,"  shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,"
4876,63,"  and there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,"
4877,63,  long after fearing to creep forth again;
4878,63,"    so, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled"
4879,63,"    into the deep dark cabins of her head,"
4880,63,
4881,63,   where they resign their office and their light
4882,63,  to the disposing of her troubled brain;
4883,63,"  who bids them still consort with ugly night,"
4884,63,  and never wound the heart with looks again;
4885,63,"    who, like a king perplexed in his throne,"
4886,63,"    by their suggestion gives a deadly groan,"
4887,63,
4888,63,   whereat each tributary subject quakes;
4889,63,"  as when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,"
4890,63,"  struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,"
4891,63,"  which with cold terror doth men's minds confound,"
4892,63,    this mutiny each part doth so surprise
4893,63,    that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;
4894,63,
4895,63,"   and, being open'd, threw unwilling light"
4896,63,  upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd
4897,63,  in his soft flank; whose wonted lily white
4898,63,"  with purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd,"
4899,63,"    no flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,"
4900,63,"    but stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed,"
4901,63,
4902,63,   this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth;
4903,63,  over one shoulder doth she hang her head;
4904,63,"  dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;"
4905,63,"  she thinks he could not die, he is not dead,"
4906,63,"    her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;"
4907,63,"    her eyes are mad that they have wept till now,"
4908,64,when icicles hang by the wall
4909,64,and dick the shepherd blows his nail
4910,64,"and tom bears logs into the hall,"
4911,64,"and milk comes frozen home in pail,"
4912,64,"when blood is nipped and ways be foul,"
4913,64,"then nightly sings the staring owl,"
4914,64,tu-who;
4915,64,"tu-whit, tu-who, a merry note,"
4916,64,"while greasy joan doth keel the pot,"
4917,64,
4918,64,"when all aloud the wind doth blow,"
4919,64,"and coughing drowns the parson's saw,"
4920,64,"and birds sit brooding in the snow,"
4921,64,and marian's nose looks red and raw
4922,64,"when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,"
4923,64,"then nightly sings the staring owl,"
4924,64,tu-who;
4925,64,"tu-whit, tu-who, a merry note,"
4926,64,"while greasy joan doth keel the pot,"
4927,65,"round about the couldron go,"
4928,65,"in the poisones entrails throw,"
4929,65,"toad,that under cold stone"
