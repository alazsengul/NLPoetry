4773,94,    bending thee 'mang the dewy weet
4774,94,"           wi' spreck'd breast,"
4775,94,"   when upward-springing, blythe, to greet"
4776,94,"           the purpling east,"
4777,94,   cauld blew the bitter-biting north
4778,94,"   upon thy early, humble birth;"
4779,94,   yet cheerfully thou glinted forth
4780,94,"           amid the storm,"
4781,94,   scarce rear'd above the parent-earth
4782,94,"           thy tender form,"
4783,94,   the flaunting flowers our gardens yield
4784,94,"   high shelt'ring woods an' wa's maun shield,"

4788,94,"           unseen, alane,"
4789,94,"   there, in thy scanty mantle clad,"
4790,94,"   thy snawie-bosom sun-ward spread,"
4791,94,   thou lifts thy unassuming head
4792,94,           in humble guise;
4793,94,"   but now the share uptears thy bed,"
4794,94,           and low thou lies!
4795,94,"   such is the fate of artless maid,"
4796,94,   sweet flow'ret of the rural shade!
4797,94,   by love's simplicity betray'd
4798,94,           and guileless trust;
4799,94,"   till she, like thee, all soil'd, is laid"
4800,94,"           low i' the dust,"
4801,94,"   such is the fate of simple bard,"
4802,94,   on life's rough ocean luckless starr'd!
4803,94,   unskilful he to note the card
4804,94,"           of prudent lore,"

4878,96,and o'er the sands the flowing tide
4879,96,"comes racing merrilee,"
4880,96,
4881,96,the hawthorn hedge is white with bloom
4882,96,the wind is soft and lown
4883,96,and sad and still you watch by me
4884,96,"your hand clasped in my own,"
4885,96,
4886,96,"oh, let the curtain bide, jessie"
4887,96,"and lift my head a wee,"
4888,96,and let the bonnie setting sun
4889,96,"glint in on you and me,"
4890,96,
4891,96,"the world seems fair and bright, jessie"
4892,96,"near loving hearts like you,"
4893,96,"but poonith's blast sifts simmer love,"
4894,96,"and makes leal friendships few,"
4895,96,
4896,96,"how aften in the dreary night,"
4897,96,i clasp my burning hands
4898,96,"upon those throbbing sleepless lids,"
4899,96,"o'er eyes like glowing brands,"
4900,96,"and ponder in my weary brain,"
4901,96,if haply when i'm dead
4902,96,my old boon friends for love of me
4903,96,"will give my bairnies bread,"
4904,96,
4905,96,"oh, did the poor not help the poor,"
4906,96,"each in their simple way,"
4907,96,"with humble gift and kindly love,"
4908,96,"god pity them i say,"
4909,96,for many a man who clasped my hand
4910,96,with friendship o'er the bowl
4911,96,when the wine halo had passed away
4912,96,"proved but a niggard soul,"
4913,96,
4914,96,"oh, blessed hope 'midst our distress,"
4915,96,"there is a promise made,"
4916,96,"that in the day the rough wind blows,"
4917,96,"the east wind shall be stayed,"
4918,96,a few short years and those i love

4925,96,"and be as thou has been to me,"
4926,96,"the truest friend on earth,"
4927,96,"so sweetly in your linnet voice,"
4928,96,"you'll sing my weans to rest,"
4929,96,"while jessie leans her weary head,"
4930,96,"upon thy loving breast,"
4931,96,
4932,96,"oh, what is fame? its wealth of lays"
4933,96,"cools not the fevered brow,"
4934,96,wilt tell his name in future days
4935,96,who whistled at the plough
4936,96,"and wrote a simple song or two,"
4937,96,for happier hearts to sing
4938,96,among the shining sheaves of corn
4939,96,"or round the household ring,"
4940,96,
4941,96,yet would i praise the bubble fame

4945,96,true friend i bless the poet skill
4946,96,"which won a friend like thee,"
4947,96,whose love 'twixt hopes of home and heaven
4948,96,"is with me constantly,"
4949,97,"o stay, sweet warbling wood-lark, stay,"

4952,97,"    thy soothing fond complaining,"
4953,97,
4954,97,"again, again that tender part,"
4955,97,"that i may catch thy melting art,"
4956,97,"for surely that wad touch her heart,"
4957,97,"    wha kills me wi' disdaining,"
4958,97,
4959,97,"say, was thy little mate unkind,"
4960,97,and heard thee as the careless wind?
4961,97,"oh, nocht but lobve and sorrow join'd,"
4962,97,"    sic notes o' woe could wauken,"
4963,97,
4964,97,thou tells o' never-ending care;
4965,97,"o' speechless grief, and dark despair;"
4966,97,"for pity's sake, sweet bird, nae mair!"
4967,97,    or my poor heart is broken!
4968,98,"all devil as i am-a damned wretch,"
4969,98,"a hardened, stubborn, unrepenting villain,"

4977,98,"ye, whom the seeming good think sin to pity;"
4978,98,"ye poor, despised, abandoned vagabonds,"
4979,98,"whom vice, as usual, has turn'd o'er to ruin,"
4980,98,"oh! but for friends and interposing heaven,"
4981,98,"i had been driven forth like you forlorn,"
4982,98,"the most detested, worthless wretch among you!"
4983,98,o injured god! thy goodness has endow'd me
4984,98,"with talents passing most of my compeers,"
4985,98,which i in just proportion have abused-
4986,98,as far surpassing other common villains
4987,98,"as thou in natural parts has given me more,"
4988,99,"o thou great being! what thou art,"
4989,99,surpasses me to know;
4990,99,"yet sure i am, that known to thee"
4991,99,"are all thy works below,"
4992,99,
4993,99,"thy creature here before thee stands,"
4994,99,all wretched and distrest;
4995,99,yet sure those ills that wring my soul
4996,99,"obey thy high behest,"
4997,99,
4998,99,"sure, thou, almighty, canst not act"
4999,99,from cruelty or wrath!
5000,99,"o, free my weary eyes from tears,"
5001,99,or close them fast in death!
5002,99,
5003,99,"but, if i must afflicted be,"
5004,99,"to suit some wise design,"
